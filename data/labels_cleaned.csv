0,GS_VJL711_Redacted,where z is the atom 's atomic number 𝜀 0 is the vacuum permittivity me is the electron 's mass and e is the charge of the electron if we divide eq 2.2 by eq 2 2.6 where v and t are potential the kinetic energy of electrons respectively 5 since the energy of a photon emitted by a hydrogen atom is given by the difference of two hydrogen energy levels where n and m are positive integers and n is greater than m. from the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a photon 𝜈 𝑐 𝜆 2.9 where c is the speed of light eq 6 can be rewritten as for hydrogen atom the atomic number z is 1. therefore the rydberg constant is defined as in this experiment we experimentally measured the rydberg constant if hydrogen gas is heated or electrically charged the electrons in the atoms are excited and the added energy pushes the electrons to higher energy orbitals when the electrons fall back to their original position the added energy is re-emitted in the form of photon and the wavelength of the photon is determined by the differnece in energy between the orbitals as shown in where m can be called the order number we set up the spectrometer as shown in fig 3.1 using a collimator a grating and a camera with a crosshair and ensured that they are in parallel the beam of photons from the light source is diffracted by the grating so we set the angular position of the camera when they are parallel as an origin and rotated it until a light fringe is observed then we measured the angle of diffraction by measuring the change in angle from the origin using a vernier we repeated this with as many other fringes as possible and statisticised the result to find the rydberg constant although the rydberg constant obtained from the experiment is reasonably close to the theoretical value the uncertainty of the constant is unacceptably huge and we found that there were various reasons that affected our value since the room was dark and it was hard to read the cramped numbers on the veriner the angle of diffraction could be measured imprecisely we concluded that this was the major factor that affected the inaccurate rydberg constant we found that the major uncertainty emerged in consequence of the wide slit size since this caused the thicker width of the light fringes this could be improved by using a narrow slit there could be various systematic errors that affected the result we tried to perfectly align the spectrometer but this could be unsuccessful also the position of the lamp should have been as close to the slit as possible since it is directly related to the intensity of the light this could make us see the cyan colour light the air pressure and humidity are also other sources but we decided that they are negligible there was background light which was inevitably required to measure the angle of diffraction we thought this could be the reason why the cyan colour of light and the 3 rd order light fringes of red and violet lights were not detected and tested without any light but we still could not see the lines in the experiment we tried to measure the rydberg constant using a hydrogen gas tube and a spectrometer and we got 𝑅 ∞ 10.5 × 10 6 ± 4.4 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 which is only 0.4 unit less than the theoretical value however we failed to obtain the precise value as our uncertainty is over 40 percent of our value and we concluded that the width of the slit was not narrow enough to produce the precise result this could be improved by repeating the experiment in a darker room with a narrower slit width and a clearer vernier as for reference this is the code that has been used for data analysis,extended,bal
1,GS_GXI055_Redacted,he aim of this experiment is to determine a value for the wavelength of the emission spectra of several different compounds this is done by burning the compounds using initially a candle but later on a butane blowtorch to excite the electrons to a higher energy shell which leads to them losing their energy in the form of a photon as they transition back down to a lower energy state the wavelength of this light is measured using a grating spectrometer the two compounds that we will be using are licl and cuso 4 these compounds were not the only ones that we attempted to determine the wavelength of however we could not excite the electrons with either the blowtorch or the candle so we did not find a value for the wavelength of these compounds the grating will measure the angle between the different slits of light from the emission spectra the experiment rests upon the idea that a diffraction grating will turn a beam of light of the same wavelength into several maxima and minima due to interference of the light waves from this and the knowledge of distance between the grating we can calculate the wavelength of the slits from which we can calculate which transition between orbitals the light represents when a compound is heated the electrons within the atoms of that compound are excited meaning they now have more energy consequently they will transition from a lower energy orbital to one of higher energy 3 the energy that the electron has absorbed is exactly equal to the energy of the higher orbital minus the energy of the lower orbital eventually the electrons de-excite meaning that they transition back to a lower energy orbital they then release the excess energy as a photon of light with a wavelength 𝜆 corresponding to that energy this is expressed in equation 2.1 as well as being shown in figure 1. where h is planck 's constant and c is the speed of light in m/s the energies of the higher energy orbital and the lower energy orbital are specific to the compound meaning that specific wavelengths will be observed from the emission spectra of different compounds the diffraction grating is made up of a large number of narrow slits that are equally spaced it has n slits with a slit separation d 5 a maxima will occur when the phase difference between two adjacent rays is 2𝜋𝑚 with m being determining wavelength of emission spectra using a grating spectrometer t an integer representing the order of the slit consequently we have equation 2.2. as path difference is equal to 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 where 𝜃 is the angle between the central maxima and the maxima we are measuring we arrive at equation 2.3. 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 𝑚𝜆 2.3 this equation allows us to relate the angle of the maxima to the wavelength of the emission spectra the maxima and minima are shown in figure 2 6 the maximum number of orders produced is found when we take 𝜃 𝜋 2 this is because the largest diffraction angle that we can have from a grating that is perpendicular to the light ray is use si for all units we set up the equipment as shown in figure 3. we had a choice of several diffraction gratings with different quantities of lines per mm we decided to use the lowest lines per mm diffraction grating of 78.8 lines per mm this is because this grating will produce the slits as closes as we can get them this is because for this grating d is the highest value if we look at equation 2.3 we can see that this will give us a smaller value of 𝜃 for a given value of m. equation 2.4 shows us that for this bigger value of d we will have a larger number of orders m that will be visible the light comes from the burning compound it then passes through the narrow slit after which it is made parallel by the collimating lens the parallel light then hits the grating at normal incidence where it is diffracted this light is then focused by the camera lens onto the crosshair at the point x. the eyepiece can be used to view the magnified image we made sure to adjust the slit and the end of the collimator to ensure that all of the diffraction slits were thin meaning that it is easier to determine their angle from the central fringe this also helped ensure that the excess light not from the compound was more easily distinguishable from the fringes we decided not to take too much time making sure the central fringe was at 0 degrees instead we took the value that the central fringe was at and then subtracted this from all of the measurements to essentially make this the zero point this method is just as precise as calibrating the spectrometer to 0 degrees this was done in order to save time so that we could take more measurements this process is shown in appendix a and b. measurements were taken by looking through the eyepiece and lining up the lens to align with one of the slits we then used the protractor attached to the side of the spectrometer to measure the angle that the lens was at this is then repeated for all of the slits that were visible to us in order for the slits to be easily distinguished we did the experiment in almost complete darkness in order to produce the emission spectra that we need to carry out the experiment we had to burn the compound we were initially instructed to use a candle to burn the compound and produce the light when this method was tried however we encountered a few problems the first was that the candle flame did n't appear to be hot enough 8 to produce the number of photons needed to make the measurements the second problem was if any photons were being produced they were not noticeable due to the large amount of light produced from the candle itself to alleviate this issue we decided to use a butane blowtorch as it is much hotter than a candle flame 9 as well as the flame being less bright in order to use the blowtorch we placed the compound into a metal bowl with some candle wax inside the wax was there as we found that the compounds burned much brighter when they were mixed with the wax making it easier to carry out our experiment we then aimed the torch downwards towards the compound as it was turned on this produced lots of coloured light which we were able to analyse through the eyepiece these measurements had to be taken relatively quickly as we found that if the compound burned for too long the candle wax would start to boil spitting at us therefore making it unsafe to work the data that we gathered from the method is summarised in table 1 and table 2. we observed the light from the licl to be red and the light from the cuso 4 to be green. this was all done in python for this reason we took the sine of all the values we had recorded then plotted this data against m on a graph as is shown in figures 4 and 5. the error bars were a combination of the errors due to the equipment added to the error due to the width of the slit meaning the angle measurement had a range these errors were added in quadrature for fig 4 we have a gradient of 0.05637. this was calculated in python by using the polyfit function that is part of the scipy package using the covariance matrix in python we calculated that the uncertainty in the graph was ±0.0005044 this uncertainty is very small in relation to the value for the gradient this is because the points on the graph all give a very similar value for wavelength so they all line up on the graph using equation 4.1 we can see that in order to find the wavelength we multiply the value for the gradient by the distance in between each line on the grating as the grating had 78.8 lines per mm we calculated that the distance between each slit is 0.0000127m we can multiply this by the gradient to find that the wavelength for photons emitted from licl to be 6.82 × 10 −7 ± 8 × 10 −9 m. it is obvious that the error in cuso 4 is bigger than the error in licl this is partially due to having less data points for the cuso 4 than the licl this is because the after the 1 st order maxima the 2 nd order maxima were too faint to be distinguished from the background light which was mainly being produced by the blowtorch from doing this experiment we noticed several areas for improvement both the candle and the blowtorch both gave wide spectra from their own light consequently the slits of light were much less well defined meaning that it was much more difficult to measure the angle another issue was that due to having to use a small aluminium container with wax in it meant we could only burn the compound for a short amount of time after a short duration of the blow torch being on the container would start to melt this is due to the melting point of aluminium being lower than the temperature of the torch 10 the setup we used also meant that the light tended to flicker as we were heating the compound this also made it far more difficult to take precise measurements in order to solve all of these problems if we were to repeat the experiment we would use the following setup to heat the compound a bunsen burner would be setup and set to a blue flame a metal scalpel would be used to scoop up the compound and place it into the flame releasing photons this means we would only have to stop each measurement when all of the compound is burned this is a definite improvement as we would have a consistent way to burn the compound getting rid of some of the flickering that we previously experienced it will also mean that we would have longer to take our measurements for the angle meaning that our values will likely be more accurate as we will not have to rush in conclusion the value of the wavelength for photons emitted from licl is 𝜆 682 × 10 −7 ± 800 × 10 −7 m the value for the wavelength of the photons emitted from cuso 4 is 𝜆 5.43 × 10 −7 ± 4.5 × 10 −8 m neither of the values for the wavelength that we have determined through our experiment agree with the accepted values for wavelength of the photons emitted from the compounds there is a percentage difference of 3 for licl and 11 for cuso 4 from the accepted values in order to gain more accurate values for the wavelengths we would repeat the experiment again making the changes that i suggested in part v of this report,extended,the
2,GS_NGT657_Redacted,the rydberg constant is one of the most important constants in atomic physics due to its relation to other fundamental constants and because of the high levels of accuracy to which it is possible to determine its value this experiment aimed to use a grating spectrometer to accurately measure this constant by observing the emission spectrum produced by a hydrogen discharge lamp and measuring the diffraction angles of the different spectral lines using these to calculate their wavelengths and then rydberg 's constant using the rydberg formula the value achieved by this method was 11030000 m -1 with an uncertainty of ± 4000 m -1 this places the result 14 σ away from the accepted value of 10973731 m -1 hen excited to higher energy states all atoms produce emission spectra due to the transitions of the atom 's electrons from higher to lower energy levels emitting energetic photons as they do so these spectra are unique to every element in accordance with the unique energy levels available to the electrons for occupation 1 studying these spectral lines has had an impact on a wide range of areas in physics observing their positions allows us to measure the distance and relative velocities of distant galaxies or the elemental composition of stars 2 developing both the theoretical understanding of these spectra and the methods to measure them then has been instrumental in progressing scientific theories and knowledge of our universe central to this theoretical appreciation of atomic spectra is the rydberg constant this constant describes the wavelengths of light in the atomic spectra relating them to the transitions of electrons resulting in the photon 's emission although discovered by balmer and rydberg empirically it was the theoretical work by bohr which followed that gave rydberg 's constant its real significance bohr proved that the constant was in fact a fundamental one by expressing it in terms of other atomic fundamentals see the next section -theory 3 amongst these constants is the fine structure constant α. this relation has lead to the rydberg constant having great importance in the field of quantum electrodynamics or qed the fine structure constant is central to qed as it is a measure of the electromagnetic coupling strength at low energies 4 the rydberg constant can be determined with an extremely high level of accuracy 3 and as such enables greater calculation of other fundamental constants especially in this case α. calculating constants to higher degrees of accuracy is often the best test for theories as has been the case for qed and allows much greater theoretical predictions as such due to progress made measuring rydberg 's constant qed is often considered the most accurate theory in modern science 5 this experiment aims to determine the value of rydberg 's constant using grating spectroscopic methods the setup results and error analysis are all presented as well as a critical analysis of the method and potential improvements a grating can be considered a large number of small equally spaced slits with a separation d. light passing through a grating forms a diffraction pattern of maxima if the wavelength of the light is λ maxima occur where the phase difference between light waves coming from the different slits is an integer m of 2π at this point the waves are in phase at the same relative positions in their oscillatory cycles and constructive interference occurs in other words the light waves sum to produce brighter patches the path difference between two waves is the physical difference in distance that the waves have travelled and is given by dsinθ as shown in figure 1 where θ is the angle the light makes with the grating the phase difference can be defined in terms of the path difference as therefore by substituting the requirements for the phase difference and the result found for the path difference and hence this is known as the grating equation unlike with simple two slit interference patterns the greater number of slits in a grating means that the maxima are much more distinct and separated by larger areas of darkness at all points other than determining rydberg 's constant by observing the emission spectrum of a hydrogen discharge lamp using a grating spectrometer w 3 the collimator was then focused so that a clear image is visible on the cross hair of the eyepiece in the telescope a minimum slit width was used to make sure the focus was good as larger beams have less defined edges making identifying the point of focus more difficult the telescope was lined up with the beam accurately using the fine motion knobs the value read on the vernier scale at this position was recorded as this was the zero position about which other measurements were referenced the telescope was then rotated exactly 90° measured using the vernier scale before placing a grating of 80 lines mm -1 in the holder the grating table was rotated so that a reflected image of the light beam was visible and aligned in the telescopeindicating a rotation of the grating of exactly 45° using the scale the grating was then rotated 45° these steps ensure the grating is accurately set at an angle of 0° or normal to the collimator the sodium lamp was swapped for the hydrogen lamp being used to take measurements the lamp was placed as close to the slit at the end of the collimator as possible to reduce the amount of background light entering the system as possible the experiment was conducted in a dark laboratory however the lamps of colleagues could still provide external light which had the potential to interfere with the diffraction patterns and the spectrum observed it was decided that both students would take measurements of the positions of the maxima as this would help identify the human differences in reading the vernier scale and account for them in a statistical error four sets of readings were taken in total the telescope was moved around the grating bed aligned with the spectral line accurately using the fine motion knobs on the bed and the angle was read off the vernier scale in order to calculate the value of θ as labelled in figure 2 the zero position reading was subtracted from the reading on the scale at the position of the line the angular positions were recorded as a function of order for each of the three different coloured spectral lines visible red blue and violet because hydrogen lamps overheat and reduce in efficiency after extended use the discharge lamp was turned on whilst the telescope was moved into position and secured and then turned off whilst the reading was taken from the vernier scale this prevented the lamp from overheating and having to wait for it to cool there were some difficulties in accurately aligning the telescope with the centre of the higher order maxima due to how faint they were in order to try and overcome this shields were used to block out as much background light as possible from the entire setup to provide a greater contrast between the spectral lines and the dark background reducing the error repeating the readings also aimed to reduce the effect of this error in the case of the violet lines the third order maxima were not always possible to see the experiment was completed over two weeks and during the first session the negative third order was not visible and in the second session the positive third order was not visible this was despite all conditions and equipment being maintained as similar as possible this did mean that some data was collected for both positive and negative higher orders however only two readings were made rather than the four achieved for the rest of the colours and orders before taking results the slit width on the collimator was adjusted so that higher order maxima in the diffraction pattern were visible by widening the slit and allowing more light to pass through however the slit could not be so wide that the beams were too large and undefined as this would add uncertainty to the measurement of their positions at this point the diffraction grating was changed from 80 lines per mm to 300 lines per mm as by considering equation 3 it is clear that a smaller gap between lines a smaller value of d leads to a larger angle between orders as both m and λ remain constant the effect of this is to reduce the relative error in the measurement of the positions the graph below shows the averages of the data collected for each colour line at each order where negative orders and angles correspond to those in the direction defined previously the error bars included on the plot have been calculated using the ranges of the data discussion of why this method was chosen follows later the error bars proved so small they are unclear on figure 3 so an example point is shown in figure 4. linear trend lines have been calculated using the least squares method weighted by the inverse of the error of each data point and plotted on the graph as can be seen from 3 the gradient of a line is 𝜆 𝑑 where d is known to be 3.33 × 10 −6 therefore the wavelengths corresponding to the light forming the three different spectral lines can be found these were found to be 653nm for red 483nm for blue and 432nm for the violet line using external resources 7 these wavelengths were related to the electron transitions producing these photons so the values of n in equation 4 were known the value of p is known to be 2 as this defines the balmer series therefore substituting in the related values of λ and n provides three values of the rydberg constant the mean average of these was taken to produce the final result of 11030000 m -1 figure 3 -the sine of the angle to different order diffraction maxima for the red blue and violet spectral lines from 3 the gradients of the lines are 𝜆 𝑑 and the wavelengths of the spectral lines were found to be 653nm 483nm and 432nm respectively orders e.g +1 and -1 +2 and -2 etc and checked that they were exactly the same as they should be if the grating is perfectly orthogonal to the incident light despite the angles in the results being similar they could have been even more accurate and this may have reduced the inaccuracy of the experiment there were other factors in the laboratory that were uncontrollable and would have had an effect on the accuracy of the experiment the air conditions such as pressure temperature and importantly how they vary were not strictly controlled beyond the fact that the experiment was completed in the same lab for the two sessions varying pressure and temperature result in a changing refractive index of the air which affects the path of the light travelling through it and would change the angles recorded 8 although this effect was considered to be too small to have a significant effect during the practical procedure if the setup could be modified to be conducted in a vacuum any potential effects from the air would be removed,deep,bal
3,GS_HHM124_Redacted,in this experiment a grating spectrometer was used to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the apparatus was already assembled my lab partner and i only had to do the calibration the diffraction grating in the experiment had 300 lines per millimeter by analyzing the data for interference lines of each colour separately one can find its wavelength by relating the found wavelengths to the appropriate changes in energy levels it is possible to find the rydberg constant using this method it was found that the value of the constant is 1.099 × 10 7 ± 2 × 10 4 𝑚 −1 the only greater problem in this experiment was that there was probably light coming from an outside source which we failed to distinguish from the hydrogen spectrum when measurements were taken the main aim of this experiment was to obtain the rydberg constant while also learning how to use a grating spectrometer with the use of a spectrometer one can study the spectrum of light 1 this allows us to thereby deduce some properties of luminous objects or substances a grating spectrometer disperses light with a grating in which the slits are equally separated this produces an interference pattern which depends on the wavelengths of the dispersed light and on the distance between the several slits in this experiment a grating spectrometer was used to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the observed interference pattern allowed us to deduce the wavelengths of photons which were produced by different transitions between energy levels in the hydrogen atom by relating the wavelengths to the appropriate transitions one can derive the rydberg constant and its uncertainty the grating is made of many slits which create an interference pattern for light of wavelength  the constructive interferences will occur at 1 where 𝛩 is the angle at which the interference line is observed d is the distance between the slits and m is the order number an integer by finding several angles at which interference occurs we can therefore accurately find also the wavelength of light furthermore the mentioned wavelength depends on the energy of the photon which is also the energy released by an atom making a transition from one energy level to another the wavelength is related to the transition between energy levels by the rydberg equation 1 where r ∞ is rydberg 's constant n is the initial energy level and p is the final energy level in our experiment we could only observe visible light which is part of the balmer series the balmer series is known to be created when atoms drop down to the second energy level from any higher energy level 1 hence we know that p will always be 2 for our cases the n related to each wavelength will be guessed by using our previous knowledge of how the colour of observed light is connected to the energy carried by photons by using 1 to find the wavelengths and then substituting them into 2 while making reasonable guesses of n we can therefore derive the rydberg constant the grating spectrometer we used consists of a collimator a table with a grating holder a camera and an eyepiece although we were given a functioning grating spectrometer my lab partner and i had to calibrate the instrument during calibration we used a sodium lamp as the light source since the hydrogen lamp overheats quickly we focused the eyepiece at a convenient viewing distance to minimize eye strain both my lab partner and i had to agree on the calibration since we wanted to take measurements independently crosschecking our data and thereby making sure that we did not make a mistake while reading the angle on the scale or aligning interference lines with the cross wire in the eyepiece then we had to focus the camera lens on a point far away since the light from our source is collimated similar to light from a distant object this was done by pointing the camera across the room the object that we pointed it at was approximately 15 meters away and focusing it in such a way that there was no parallax between the seen image and the cross wire the camera had to point directly at the collimator to achieve this the camera was rotated by 90 degrees so that it was at a right angle with respect to the collimator a mirror was placed in the holder for the grating slight adjustments were made to position of the mirror until the reflected light was aligned with the cross wire this meant that the mirror was forming an angle of 45 degrees with both the collimator orientation and the camera orientation by rotating the camera back by 90 degrees and the table with the holder by 45 degrees the camera was pointing directly at the collimator and the grating would be perpendicular to their orientation the mentioned parts were then clamped into position we also had to set the right height of the grating by taking a quick look at the interference lines we noticed that the ones at greater angles were dimmer and were above the centre of the cross wire we used three screws in the table to adjust the height and orientation the table could be tilted because there were three screws so that the grating was not tilted and we could clearly see all the interference lines when the setup was complete the sodium lamp was replaced with the hydrogen lamp and we started taking measurements a grating with 300 slits per mm was used in table 1 we can see all the interference lines at what angles they occurred and their colours we initially estimated the errors for each measurement based on the difference between our recordings and the width of the interference line which was approximately 2 arcminutes most of the errors were in the range of 3 to 6 arcminutes however there were some measurements were the uncertainty range did not cover the same values as the measurement on the opposite side with the opposite order number since this indicated that the error estimation had to be too small i decided to increase the error associated with the two measurements these errors got larger than i hoped but fortunately there were at least three measurements for each colour that were quite accurate because the wavelength was calculated from the slope of the graph the error of the wavelength was not too large since the accurate measurements determined the slope to a great extent the wavelength of each colour was determined by plotting a sin θ versus order number m. the error of sin θ was obtained by using the fact that at first i plotted the sin θ versus order number lines for all the colours on the same graph in python fig 2 but i also wanted to find the uncertainties of each slope since this is rather inconvenient in python i decided to use logger pro to find the minimum and maximum slopes this method is shown in appendix a. from 1 we can deduce that where k is the slope of the graph for one of the colours 𝜆 is the wavelength of light of that colour and d the distance between two slits the diffraction grating used in our experiment had 300 slits per millimeter with no uncertainty stated i estimated it to be 0.5 of a slit per millimeter since otherwise the grating would have a different slit per unit length number stated on it 2 we can see that all the wavelengths match the true values except the wavelength for green light does not but there is a slight deviation of the mean values this might be due to systematic errors most noticeable is the fact that the central line is not at exactly 0 degrees but at 3 arcminutes this indicates that the diffraction grating is not perfectly perpendicular although the angle by which it is deviated is small this could have caused a greater change in the angles at which the interference patterns occur the green colour is not even close to any of the wavelengths in the hydrogen emission spectrum and there are also quite large deviations of the data points from the best fit line most likely causes for its occurrence is that there is another element with hydrogen in the same lamp or that it occurred because of another light source i am more inclined towards the latter explanation because it also explains why the uncertainties were so large if light is not coming perpendicular to the grating the pattern will not be described perfectly by 1 from the wavelengths obtained in table 2 it is possible to calculate the rydberg constant since it was already explained that the green colour wavelength does not match any of the values from literature it will not be used to obtain rydberg 's constant the other three wavelengths will be used and we can expect to obtain very accurate values since the wavelengths were also found to be accurate the final energy level in each case is 2 since all the emission lines are part of the balmer series furthermore the initial energy levels for each wavelength will be guessed based on the fact that the energy of a photon is inverse proportional to the wavelength for example red light has the largest wavelength hence it was produced by the lowest energy transition where the initial energy state is 3. blue light has slightly more energy hence the initial state is 4 and in the case of purple light the initial energy state is 5. equation 2 can be rearranged to obtain the rydberg constant i decided to write down the values for the constant to 9 significant figures since they will be used together to get the final result by taking the average of the three values for each colour we obtain the following result 𝑅 ∞ 10986233.4 ± 17863.9 𝑚 −1 ≅ 1.099 × 10 7 ± 2 × 10 4 𝑚 −1 6 the value of the constant found in literature is 𝑅 ∞ 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 2 the obtained value for the rydberg constant has the value from literature included in its uncertainty range we can conclude that the experimental procedure was appropriate and the error estimations were reasonable the aim of this experiment was to obtain the value of rydberg 's constant the experimental procedure was quite good because we have obtained an accurate value for the constant but there are still some possibilities for improvement we should have definitely checked that we have observed the right colours since it turned out that one of the observed ones was not coming from hydrogen this was not a huge problem since the constant could still be derived from other colours furthermore we could have also minimized other errors we could have repeated the calibration until the central interference line would be at exactly 0 degrees because probably then we would have also seen smaller differences between the measurements on opposite sides the error on the distance between two slits is also probably an overestimation one way to lower it would be two use light with known wavelength find its interference patter and calculate the distance between two slits with the associated uncertainty the greatest strength of the data analysis for this experiment in my opinion was using the sine of angle versus order number graph because it really helped to lower the uncertainty in the slope and consequently in the rydberg constant appendix a estimating the uncertainties of slopes although the determination of uncertainties of slopes is of central importance i decided to put in into in the appendix because it takes a large amount of space logger pro was used to determine the uncertainties in slopes at first all the data points with uncertainties were plotted by using the `` model '' function under the `` analyze '' tab i was able to create an arbitrary best fit line and change its slope to see what are the greatest and lowest slopes that could be plotted through the error bars,expert,bal
4,GS_BSS023_Redacted,"the aim of this experiment was to provide a calculation for rydberg 's constant by using the emission lines of hydrogen by observing red and aqua emission lines the expected transition level for each and using the spectrometer equation we were able to obtain two very close values for rydberg 's constant and establish a final value and uncertainty for the red emission lines we obtained a value of 𝟏𝟎 𝟕𝟕𝟐𝟏𝟑𝟒 ± 𝟎 𝟎𝟐𝟗𝟗𝟒𝟎 × 𝟏𝟎 𝟔 𝒎 −𝟏 and for the aqua emission lines we obtained 𝟏𝟎 𝟕𝟗𝟒𝟐𝟖𝟎 ± 𝟎 𝟎𝟐𝟑𝟕𝟏𝟗 × 𝟏𝟎 𝟔 𝒎 −𝟏 .the percentage errors are 0.28 and 0.22 respectively though neither value is within 𝝈 of the generally-accepted value for 𝑹 ∞ i. ascertaining the elemental makeup of objects is an important task in both research and industrial applications thus if we were able to determine this composition by the emission or absorption spectra of objects we would have a non-invasive technique to determine their makeup rydberg 's constant enables us to make predictions as to the constituent elements of objects based just on their emission spectrum and its value is therefore an important experimental quantity to be determined calculating rydberg 's constant enables us to reliably determine the expected emission spectra of different materials and hence employ physical methods in order to nondestructively determine the chemical composition of different compounds we can also employ such techniques to successfully determine the composition of otherwiseinaccessible objects such as stars 2 in order to determine rydberg 's constant 𝑅 ∞ we use a grating spectrometer first we experimentally determine the wavelengths of hydrogen 's emission lines using the grating equation we then experimentally determine the value of 𝑅 ∞ an atom is composed of a nucleus and an electronic shell depending on the element the atom can have multiple layers on its electronic shell each with a quantized energy level this means that electrons can not occupy energy states in between those levels however when an atom is excited i.e when energy is imparted upon it its electrons can gain enough energy to transition to a level farther away from the nucleus afterward they will transition back to their original energy level and in the process release a photon of energy level equivalent to the energy difference energy gap between the electron 's transition levels these emitted photons constitute the atom 's emission spectrum we use rydberg 's constant to predict what sort of photons i.e predict their wavelength and energy a certain element 's spectrum will consist of 2 the grating spectrometer uses a grating with 𝑁 slits to disperse incident light the light which passes through the grating will be deflected at an angle 𝜃 and will suffer from constructive and destructive interference due to their change in phase which will in turn create a certain interference pattern according to theory this interference pattern will roughly resemble a succession of peaks and valleys the phase difference between neighbouring rays is given by 1 the valleys of the pattern correspond to the minima of interference which occur for 𝑁 slits when the peaks of this interference pattern correspond to the maxima of interference which occur when the phase difference is an integer multiple of 2n 1 c/ 2nm 2nm 2 dsin 0 5 according to theoretical expectations we would expect any transition photon to obey the relation 6 where n and p are the numbers of the initial and final energy states of the atom equation 6 allows us to obtain an experimental value for rex given that we know the other quantities for our experiment p 2 in all cases while n 3 for red light and n 4 for aqua light 4 in order to obtain j we can use the grating equation 1 where j is the w avelength of the spectral line d is the distance between two slits in our diffraction grating e is the angle at which an interference maximum occurs and m is the corresponding order number the order number is an integer quantity and for the i th line of a specific colour observed after rotating the grating clockwise or anti-clockwise from the defined starting position i m thus m can take both negative and positive values according to equation 7 if we plot sin 0 as a function of m we should obtain a linear plot from whose gradient we can extract j and calculate its associated error namely the gradient from we then use the covariance matrix our number of samples is large enough to use this method to find the uncertainty of this parameter r which we will call ay thus we obtain -from which we find 11 from equation 6 we find from this w e find the uncertainty in our value for r 00 our final result will be in the form before performing the experiment we had to calibrate the spectrometer so as to achieve a good resolution defined as the resolving power at which both my lab partner and i were able to easily observe two given sets of spectral emission lines the process was performed using a sodium lamp since it did not run the risk of burning out and consisted of the diffraction grating we used had 77.8 slits per millimetre and we found it to be best in achieving a good resolution in the spectrometer the actual experiment was done using a hydrogen lamp which allowed us to observe hydrogen 's spectral emission lines for increased accuracy the device used to measure the angle included a vernier scale so we were able to measure our results with ½ arcminute precision after establishing the 0 𝑡ℎ order number we rotated the optical device clockwise and anticlockwise recording the angle of diffraction and the order number we then processed the data computationally creating a line of best fit between the order number and the sine of the diffraction angle our experimental results confirm the expectation of the linear relationship between the order number and the sine of the angle at which interference maxima occur as is evident from the figures below however when plotting the residuals obtained when we subtract the expected values from the real values a nonlinear trend is observed which points to systematic errors occurring in our experimental setup therefore for the red and aqua maxima we obtain the percentage error on these values is 0.28 and 0.22 for red and aqua respectively which implies high statistical accuracy derived from the large sample base and low overall random error the random error which does exist is likely due to not reading the middle of the emission line accurately statistical error could be even further reduced by systematically building an even larger database of measurements nevertheless our experimental ranges do not coincide or include the expected theoretical value for rydberg 's constant 3 𝑅 ∞ 10,973,731.6 𝑚 −1 10.9737316 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 this is likely due to systematic error affecting the experiment some sources of systematic error likely include misalignment of the optical piece tiny differences in air pressure and temperature cause slight changes in the behaviour of the space through which light passes thereby introducing small errors in our readings improving the experiment would require more stringent conditions for performing it firstly the room in which the experiment was performed was not dark and might have caused us to miss some of the maxima associated with higher order numbers as these were less visible when parasitic light upset the experimental setup moreover repeating the experiment several times would help improve confidence in the results an improved setup and procedure would be instead of using a manual rotating mechanism use a mechanical rotator and measure the angles of the emission maxima using a digital instrument write a program which can recognize the colour and order number of the emission maxima and thus build a digital database with reliable and highly precise measurements look to quantify systematic error from optical piece misalignment and the aforementioned differences in air pressure and temperature by means of a different experiment so as to get a proper margin of error using a grating spectrometer we were able to precisely measure rydberg 's constant while thanks to the number of samples and thorough experimental procedure the statistical random error on our results is very small as outlined in the previous section comparison with the generally accepted value for rydberg 's constant reveals that we have not measured it to an adequate level of accuracy this is due to the errors discussed above nonetheless having the value for rydberg 's constant enables us to perform theoretical research as well as to apply our knowledge to practical applications in research spectroscopy can be used to determine the composition of stars and other light-emitting objects in industrial applications spectroscopy can be used to non-destructively determine the exact chemical composition of materials used in industrial applications these applications thus enable us to check assumptions made in scientific research and theory as well as to aid in practical industrial development appendix i includes the table of values used for determining the fits present heretofore and for the uncertainties obtained this is to acknowledge the help in performing the experiment offered by my lab partner",expert,the
5,GS_FTZ138_Redacted,the excitation and subsequent deexcitation of an electron in an atom results in the emission of one or several photons the rydberg formula relates the difference in the energy states of the electron to the wavelength of the emitted photon 1 and contains the rydberg constant hence by determining the wavelengths emitted and the respective energy transitions causing them completed here for hydrogen an accurate value for the rydberg constant can be found the final value determined was 1.07x10 7 ± 6.69x10 4 m -1 which has a difference of 2.42 to the current accepted value a standard grating spectrometer was used to measure the angle of diffraction of the emission lines from a hydrogen lamp which allowed the wavelength of each line to be calculated the inverse of the wavelength is plotted against a function of its corresponding excited principal quantum number and the gradient is used to calculate the rydberg constant he balmer series was discovered in 1885 and is described by a purely empirical formula relating the inverse wavelength of the emission lines seen from a hydrogen discharge lamp to a series of integers this formula was then generalized by johannes robert rydberg in 1889 but it was only after developments in the atomic model by niels bohr in 1913 that the formula could be explained by theory 1 the derivation for this formula is written in the appendix of this report the balmer series only applies to photons emitted in the visible spectrum due to electrons deexciting to principal quantum number n 2. however the generalisation can be used to describe other series such as the lyman series of ultraviolet lines due to deexcitation to n 1 and can also easily be modified to suit any nucleus 2 where λ is the emitted wavelength z is the atomic number of the atom being excited in the case for hydrogen z 1 r∞ is the rydberg constant and n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and excited states of the electron respectively n2 n1 the rydberg constant is currently one of the most accurately-measured physical constants with a recommended relative uncertainty of 6.6x10 -12 3 it is an extremely important and relevant constant because it is inherently linked to the fine structure constant among several other fundamental constants which can be tested for consistency in various physical systems hence verifying the accuracy of the theory 4 the experimental method used here to determine its value is relatively simple a hydrogen discharge lamp was used to emit various wavelengths of light corresponding to different energy changes due to electrons deexciting from different energy levels three different wavelengths were emitted and seen through the telescope of a grating spectrometer as each wavelength had diffracted by a different amount the grating equation where λ is the wavelength d is the distance between each slit in the grating θ is the angle to the central maximum that a maximum is seen and m is the order of diffraction was then used to calculate the wavelength of each emitted colour this was done by plotting the sine of the angle to the central maximum that a maximum was observed against the order at which the angle was observed multiplying the gradient of the resultant graph by d gave the wavelength this was repeated for each colour until the three wavelengths were found in order to carry out a second plot to determine the value of r∞ the value of n2 for each corresponding wavelength had to be found because electrons were deexciting to energy level 2 it was deduced that values of n2 had to be 3 4 and 5. the larger the difference between n1 and n2 the more energy is emitted as light and hence the lower the wavelength a plot was made of the inverse wavelength against − and the gradient -which is equal to the value of r∞ -was found the grating spectrometer used was a standard student spectrometer comprised of a collimator telescope and rotatable mount focus knobs were used to focus the eyepiece and collimator the eyepiece was focused so that an object a simple mark on an illuminated blank sheet of paper held up against a wall around 30cm away was seen clearly and the telescope was focused on an illuminated marker approximately 9m away this was a good enough approximation for the object to be at an `` infinite '' distance so that no parallax is observed blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk t a sodium lamp as then placed by the slit to focus the collimator and find the optimal slit width the reason for using this lamp was because a hydrogen lamp which was used for the rest of the experiment would be prone to overheating if left active for large periods of time the lamp would have to be continuously running so the time taken to focus the collimator was far greater than that of taking individual measurements a similar procedure was carried out regarding the focusing the instrument this time focusing on an image of the emission spectrum of sodium the lamp initially glowed purple rather than the characteristic orange of sodium due to a small amount of radon present in the lamp before the sodium was completely vapourised the slit width was then lowered so that the line width observed was lower this was done because the width of the line could be used as a measure of uncertainty the angle of the line to the central maximum would be measured at the centre of the line so if the line is wider the measurement is more likely to deviate from the centre of the line ensuring that the telescope was precisely 180° to the collimator by lining up the centre of the line with the centre of the eyepiece crosswire the vernier scale on the grating table was used to rotate the telescope through 90°00 ± 03 the smallest realistic value that could be read off the scalewhich reads to the nearest arc-minute and clamped in position the collimator and telescope were then perpendicular to each other the reading on the vernier scale at this point was 15°54 a 300 line/mm grating was placed in the rotatable mount at the centre of the grating table this grating as chosen over the 80 line/mm option because in order to calculate the wavelength the grating equation was used assuming the error in angle is constant e.g due to resolution of the vernier scale maximising the angle will lead to the minimisation of percentage uncertainty associated with the angle this can be done by increasing d in the grating equation in order for the grating to be exactly perpendicular to the collimated incident light the grating was rotated until the reflection of the emission lines was seen in the telescope this ensured that the grating was 45° to both the collimator and telescope so by adding 45°00 to the angle above the grating was positioned precisely perpendicular to the incident light the telescope was then rotated back to the central maximum of the diffraction pattern the process was repeated for the hydrogen lamp this was done relatively quickly and the lamp did not overheat with the central maximum being at 211°45 and a width of 0°55 212°13 -211°18 tables 1.1 to 1.3 below are presented as such because each of the three colours violet cyan red was analysed separately to give a distinct wavelength only the mean measured angle is given and the central maximum was observed at angle 211°45 with a width of 0° 55 the width was used as an estimate of uncertainty in θ based on the idea that measurements to the centre of any line can only be made accurate to ± one quarter of the width of the line this is because it was estimated that the angle actually measured would only fall into half the width either side of the true centre of the line the sine of the width of the central maximum was used as the uncertainty in θ when plotting sin θ against order however this value was not used in any calculations because it is only a very rough not even taking into account the widths of the other maxima suggestion as to how uncertainty could be measured fig 1.1 5 a basic pasco model student spectrometer that could be used to determine the wavelengths of spectral emission from a hydrogen lamp fig 1.2. showing a sodium lamp and spectrometer where the diffraction grating is 45° to both the collimator and telescope this is to ensure it will be precisely perpendicular to the incident light after being rotated precisely 45° clockwise in this case as can be seen the angle measured at an order is roughly equal to the angle of the opposite order this agrees with what should be seen as the interference pattern is symmetrical about the central maximum furthermore when determining the fit of the line a small value for intercept found for each fit for cyan and red this was of the order -10 -4 and for violet was 10 -3 although this is negligible compared to other sources of uncertainty such as the width of the line it does suggest that a slight systematic error may be present one source could be due to the diffraction grating not being precisely perpendicular to the incident light hence resulting in the modified grating equation where θi is the angle of incidence to the grating this leads to an intercept of -sin θi because the intercept is small and a mixture of both positive and negative values this implies that the grating may have been rotated first in one direction for cyan and red and then in the opposite direction for violet possibly due to a component not being clamped firmly in place the value of the intercept is negligible but worth noting here the scipy library also allows for the fit of a line to be calculated the output of which is displayed in the table below scipy is also able to output the covariance matrix which can be used to determine the uncertainty in the gradient and intercept letting m represent the gradient of the line for the plot above firstly this allows the wavelength to be found by simply multiplying the gradient by the constant d 10 -3 300 m and secondly since the uncertainty in m is given by the root of the first value in the covariance matrix the uncertainty in λ can be calculated by multiplying the uncertainty in m by the partial derivative of the right-hand side of equation 3 with respect to m which is simply bohr used the idea that electrons could only occupy allowed energy levels in an atom and can only move between them if given or releasing the same energy as a photon as the difference between the two levels initial i and final f because bohr 's model proposed that electrons can only emit energy when transitioning between energy levels an electron could move in a stable orbit around the nucleus without emitting energy hence the magnitude of the electron 's angular momentum would have to be quantized such that where me is the rest mass of the electron h is planck 's constant n is an integer representing the principal quantum number and rn and vn are the radius and speed of the electron at orbit n. bohr 's simplified model of the electron orbiting in a circular orbit around a far larger proton meant he could equate the coulomb force to the centripetal force acting on the electron at orbit n where e is the magnitude of the charge of the electron and c d is the permittivity of free space solving equations 2 and 3 simultaneously gives the following expressions for the radius and speed of an electron at principal quantum number n and 5 the total energy of the electron is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies and by again assuming that the electron maintains a stable orbit around a proton is given by it is easily seen that this reduces to a change in n from ni to nf will correspond to a change in energy of ei to ef using 1 and 7,superficial,exp
6,GS_BYH124_Redacted,this report presents a method which makes use of the grating spectrometer for studying the spectmm of light of a hydrogen lamp and using this spectmm to determine the rydberg constant the latter is cmcial in spectroscopy and as it can be written as the product of several fundamental constants it can act as an auxiliary constant in detennining physics fundamental constants 1 in this experiment which was cruried out on the 8 th of december 2017 the wavelength of three distinct visible colours nrunely the red blue and violet colours of the hydrogen lrunp have been detennined and which were then used in detennining the rydberg constant the value obtained in this experiment for the latter is 3.45 ± 1.03 x 10 6 m-1 t he grating spectrometer is any instrnment used for detemuning the wavelength of a light source or that of its components the light source monochromatic or polychromatic can be any luminous body from the solid state to the gaseous state be it natural or not the diffraction grating uses the principles of interference to spectrnm light into its component colours 2 in this case instead of using a cornell single or a young double slit grating the grating has a ve1y large number of equally spaced very naitow slits 1tl- e obltcll '' lt111 tn collllna11r figure 1 shows a sketch of the different labelled components and adjustments of a typical grating spectrometer in a laboratory used for examining the spectnuu oflight 3 it can be seen that the grating spectrometer consists of a slit w hose opening can be adjusted using the screw at g to control the amount of light passing through the collimator the latter is used to produce pru•allel beams of light the prism table is used to suppo1t the grating between the collimator and telescope there the grating dispersed the light into its different component colours there is also a vemier-calliperlike compass below the prism table on the rotating base which allows us to measure angles see the theory sect.ion for more details if we look through the eyepiece we can see these different components as well as the original light the screws at b c d and e are used to lock a setup used for the experiment in place 3 a hydrogen lamp is a slim tube consisting of two electrodes one at each end the lamp contains hydrogen gas at low pressure if we apply a high voltage across the electrodes a bright pink glow is enutted by the tube only certain colours can be seen with naked eyes through the eyepiece when the light is passed through a grating because the other colours are either in the infra-red or ultra-violet regions of the light spectmm 4 figure 2 shows on the right the light emitted by the hydrogen lamp when no grating is present and on the left the three colours which can be seen with the spectrometer when the pink light passes through a grating 5 a principal maximum is a region where the intensity of a diffracted light passing through a grating is the highest l l page whereas a minimum is where the intensity of the diffracted light is lowest principal maxima occur when the phase difference between adjacent rays of a light of wavelength λ is an integer multiple m of 2π where m is the order number 6 the formula for the phase difference is given by the path difference is d sin θ and therefore we obtain the phase angle of the first minimum with n slits illuminated is given by transition wavelengths in hydrogen are given via where r∞ is the rydberg constant and n and p are integers representing the energy levels of the initial and final states of the atom respectively 6 equation 4 gives the balmer series in hydrogen with p 2 and n 3 4 5 ... depending on the colour of the spectrum the band theory suggests that in the atoms of a gas the electrons orbit the nucleus in a set of energy levels 8 by supplying sufficient energy to the electrons the electrons can translate from a lower energy level to a higher one depending of the distance between the lower n 2 and higher level n 3 4 5 ... and so depending on the amount of energy supplied to the electrons we say that electrons on higher energy levels are in the excited state however these excited electrons can not remain 'excited for ever and so they eventually fall back to their original energy level in doing so the electrons emit a packet of energy known as a photon of a certain wavelength transition wavelength 9 for the balmer series the transition wavelengths in hydrogen are in the visible part of the spectrum before starting the experiment with the hydrogen lamp the spectrometer needs to be calibrated prior the eye piece is made to focus on the cross-hair by adjusting the screw on the telescope the setting should cause as little strain on the eyes as possible the camera lens is then focused on a distant object say a building 's window which should be 5 to 10 metres away so as there is no parallax between the image and the cross-hair after this adjustment the telescope is aligned with the axis of the collimator a sodium lamp is used for the last parts of the spectrometer calibration instead of the hydrogen lamp itself because unlike the hydrogen lamp the lines spectra of the light from the monochromatic sodium lamp do not fade away as the lamp gets hotter therefore there is no need to rush when calibrating the spectrometer and so we can calibrate the figure 3 shows the path difference between two neighbouring light rays when a light passes through a grating slit with spacing d 7 figure 4 represents the balmer transitions in a hydrogen atom for different initial states n 3 4 5 6 and final state p 2 depending on the initial state level assorted colours are seen 10 figure 5 shows the setup of the grating spectrometer light from the source passes through the collimator and comes out of it as parallel beams the light then passes through the grating where it is diffracted into its components using the telescope which can be rotated a magnified image of the different orders can be seen 11 1 2 with the sodium lamp light on the slit at the collimator is open slightly and the focus of the collimator is adjusted until we obtain a sharp image of one of the orders at the cross-hair looking at the scale of angles on the rotating base the telescope is rotated precisely 90 degrees and is fixed in that position this scale consists of a main scale 0° -360° which is in degrees and a vemier scale o -30 which is in minutes just like with a standard vemier calliper the vemier zero is the reference division when reading on the main scale then the vernier scale division which coincides with one of the main scale division is used to calculate the final angle 1 minute on the vemier scale equals to 60° on the main scale 12 let us say for instance we deliberately coincide the vemier zero scale with the 160° main scale division to tum the telescope by 90° the 50° division on the main scale should coincide with the vemier zero division which should remain in a fix position that is only the main scale should be rotated retuming to the spectrometer calibration a suitable grating is placed on the table between the collimator and the telescope the grating used in this experiment has approximately 78.8 lines per mm 6 the table is rotated until a reflected image of the entrance slit can be seen in the eyepiece this usually occurs when the plane of the grating is at 45° as from the collimator axis the telescope is then moved around until we get a diffracted image of the slit at an enough large angle of diffraction ohl h• ... '' '' '' to left on plane of paper 13 we consider orders to the right anticlockwise of the zero order to be positive while orders on the right clockwise to b e negative to minimise en-ors when taking measurements of angles it is better to measure the angles of the orders on both sides of the zero order the data for the order numbers and their con-esponding positions from the zero order of the sodium lamp s light is tabulated using these data a graph of d sin 0 against order m eq.2 is plotted using a computer with the programming language python by writing some functions both the gradient of the graph and the uncertainty in the gradient can be obtained on the computer the gradient of the graph gives us a .. if the calculated wavelength of the light is between 589.0 run and 589.6 run 6 then the spectrometer has been accurately calibrated and so we can begin the ma.in experiment with the hydrogen lamp after having obtained the wavelengths of the different colours from the hydrogen lamp with the same method mentioned in the previous paragraph a graph of 1/ a. against 1/n 2 -1/p 2 eq.4 is plotted and the gradient uncertainty can b e obtained using python the gradient of this graph gives us the negative of the rydberg 's constant the wavelength of sodium obtained in this experiment is 878 ± 180 run the latter does not fall in the range between 589.0 run and 589 .6 run even if we consider the uncertainty associated with it this proves that the calibration was not properly done or/and there were lots of systematic e1rnrs the graph figure 7 below shows the straight-line relationship of d sin 0 against order m. for the second graph figure 8 which depicts the plot of the three visible components of hydrogen the w avelength obtained for the red component is 67 1 ± 82 run that of the blue component is 480 ± 140 nm and finally the wavelength of the violet component is 625 ± 120 nm the wavelengths of the red and blue l • determining the wavelength of hydrogen emission spectra components fall in the officially accepted ranges which are between 622 nm -780 run and betv.•een 455 nm -492 nm respectively 14 if we consider the uncertainties associated with them how ever the calculated value for the violet co~ponent does not fall in the range 390 run -455 nm 14 which means there were lots of sources of eitor during its measurement the intersection of the lines gives an indication how accurately the grating spectrometer w as calibrated the closer the intersection is to the zero-order m the better the calibration of the grating spectrometer is ultimately the gradient of the final graph figure 9 which is a plot of 1/ a against l/n 2 -l/p 2 gives us the negative of the rydberg constant for the red colour n 3 for the blue colour n 5 and for the violet one n 6 10 thus the positive value of the latter obtained computationally is then the main aim of the experiment was to detennine the rydberg constant roo using a hydrogen lamp and the grating spectroscopy method a sodium lamp was used durin the calibration of the grating spectrometer during the experiment there were a lot of problems and systematic eitors w e encountered and this can be shown that our result obtained for the rydberg constant 3.45 ± 1.03 x 10 6 m-1 is very far from the officially accepted value 1 0 973 731.6 m-1 5 the first problem was that after sometimes it became ve1y difficult to position accurately the cross-hair on the violet ~olow spectra of the hydrogen light due to the ve1y low light m tens1ty we could not even see the cross-hair through the eyepiece secondly we knew during the experiment that as the hydrogen lamp gets more and more hot the colour components of the latter fade away and so we decided to tum the lamp off for the lamp to cool down however when we tried to tum it on again the lamp never lighted on • again and so we had to change our hydrogen lamp therefore i think that taking measurement of the violet colour from another hydrogen lamp induced significant uncertainties in our result the third problem was that it was quite difficult to read the scale on the spectrometer rotating base even using a loop equipped with a lighted bulb while trying to read the scale of angles it caused some eye-strained to address the first and second problems a deuterium lamp can be used to detemune the rydberg constant instead of a hydrogen lamp because the deuterium lamp gives greater intensity and has a longer life even though it costs more 15 the third problem can be solved by using a grating spectrometer which has a digital scale of angles so that the measurements of the position of the orders are more accurate and easier to read even though we did not get the result we hoped for this experiment taught us how to calibrate a grating spectrometer how to use it to determine the rydberg constant and how difficult it is to determine the latter to high accuracy,superficial,the
7,GS_TGO908_Redacted,10 900 000 ± 232 000 m-1 chemical elements emit discrete frequencies of electromagnetic radiation when atoms go from a high energy state to a lower energy state the transition of electrons from a higher energy level eu to a lower energy level el cause the emission of photons with energy a diffraction grating can separate frequencies of this electromagnetic radiation when a beam of light is incident upon it giving unique emission spectra for each element this is possible because distinct wavelengths of light deviate from the central maximum by different amounts the formula relates the wavelength 𝜆 of light from a maximum in the emission spectrum to the principal quantum numbers 𝑛 𝑈 and 𝑛 𝐿 where 𝑛 𝑈 is the higher energy level and 𝑛 𝐿 is the lower energy level r represents the rydberg constant whose value we to derive using a spectrum of hydrogen in this experiment the frack-hertz experiment 1 portrayed the existence of energy levels by investigating the motion of electrons in mercury vapour electrons orbiting the nucleus at fixed radii and spectral lines being of discrete wavelengths imply that the magnitude of an electrons angular momentum is quantised 2 mathematically represented as this is further corroborated when instead of a particle approach we take a wave approach to the atomic model where electrons are standing waves with wavelength 𝜆 𝑛 a distance 𝑟 𝑛 away from the nucleus for a standing wave to be feasible the wavelengths in a circular orbit should be a whole number n 1 2 3 … using 4 and de broglie 's relationship for wavelength and momentum 3 can be derived in hydrogen the force required to cause centripetal acceleration of the electron around the proton is provided by the electrical attraction between the two negatively charged particles combining coulomb 's law and newton 's second law gives us the equation simultaneously equating 3 and 5 gives values for 𝑟 𝑛 and 𝑣 𝑛 that can be used to obtain the total energy for the n th orbit in the bohr model en which can conventionally be written as where r is the rydberg constant the rydberg formula 2 can very simply give the wavelengths of the radiation emitted when electron transitions energy levels in this experiment the higher energy levels 𝑛 𝑈 from which the electron de-excites are 3 4 and 5 with the photon colours being red blue and violet respectively in the laboratory we determined the rydberg constant by shining a hydrogen lamp through a spectrometer to obtain an emission spectrum the spectrometer used consisted of a collimator and telescope between which the diffraction grating was placed as light from the source passed through the slit into the collimator a beam of parallel light rays was produced 3 incident on the diffraction grating in accordance with huygens principle 4 the beam of light disperses into a spectrum according to huygens each point the grating spectrometer -rydberg constant despite the same person reading the scale in addition to the ± 3ʹ error from reading the value there would be a further ± 3ʹ error due to any faults in setting up the spectrometer for the red and blue lines the slit width was extremely narrow resulting in a negligible error due to a wide slit for the violet spectral lines we measured the difference in angle between one end of the band to the other to be 1ʹ when graphed these errors are very inconspicuous after obtaining values for 𝜃 for different order numbers n plotting graphs for 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against n gives straight lines for each wavelength due to the proportional relationship between them with a gradient using the covariance matrix in python the graphical uncertainties shown in table ii can be calculated along with values for the rydberg constant in table i the errors from measuring and incorrect calibration are much higher than these values meaning they are more significant than the statistical errors from table i the average rydberg constant can be calculated as 10 863 637 m -1 the uncertainties from table ii table iii and the standard error from the mean calculation add in quadrature giving the uncertainty corresponding with the average rydberg constant which is 231 705 m -1 therefore the result of the experiment is 10 900 000 ± 232 000 𝑚 −1 there is a possibility if the setting up of the spectrometer has gone significantly wrong that there is a substantial systematic error in the value calculated a way to recognise the systematic error would be to repeat the experiment with different equipment and set up the spectrometer again another way to analyse the results obtained is to realise that the beam at order numbers n 1 and n -1 are symmetrical about the zero-order beam path therefore the value 𝜃 for both these orders is the same this gives us two values for each order from which an average angular deviation can be found however these can not be used to calculate the standard error for each order wavelength additionally this method of analysis does not require graphical representation of the results at all an example of this method being used with the red spectral lines is shown in table iv from here an average wavelength for the specific colour can be computed and then this can be substituted into the rydberg formula in this method of analysis there are statistical uncertainties due to working out the mean instead of the graphical uncertainties from the initial method the standard errors of the wavelengths are manipulated to become the errors in the rydberg constants calculated using each of the three wavelengths further manipulation of the uncertainties and the values for the rydberg constant the result determined by this analysis method is 10 900 000 ± 244 000 𝑚 −1 this value is relatively similar to the one calculated from the previous analysis the difference is that the uncertainty in this method is slightly greater this could be due to the addition of the standard errors in calculation the standard error in inversely proportional to the square root of the number of data samples a way to improve the uncertainty in this method is to increase the number of data samples in this experiment the value obtained for the rydberg constant is in the same magnitude as the measured value also it is consistent to 2 significance levels however there are many improvements which can be made so that the error associated with this value is decreased firstly obtaining more data would mean the values for the deviation angles is more reliable also it would allow an average to be calculated this reduces the chance of anomalies in calculations which could be due to misjudgement of the vernier scale even though an average can be calculated by using the second analysis in the results section the number of total data points remain the same so the anomalies can not be recognised and omitted as well as possible also calculating the standard error with a sample of 2 will give a large error contribution secondly increasing the width of the slit for the violet spectral line caused a high contribution of uncertainty to the final value a way to improve would be to remove any other sources of light present in the space around us this would increase the contrast between the black background and violet spectral line the rydberg constant is useful because it is part of an elegant formula that allows the transition wavelengths to be calculated easily,superficial,bal

the duality between classical and quantum mechanics indeed at small scales nature behaves in a quantified way whereas at larger scales it behaves in a continuous way the experiment we realised is very important as it is one of the few where we can observe at our macroscopic scale phenomena having a quantum origin indeed we observed that atoms light emission was quantified to specific wavelength this observation led us to discuss the dual nature of light this experiment uses the effect of light diffraction see ii.a to look at what happens inside the atom the rydberg constant is one of the fundamental physical constant and is today known to 14 decimal places 1 using a grating spectrometer see fig 2 to look at the emission rays of hydrogen atoms coming from a hydrogen lamp see fig 2 we aimed to calculate the rydberg constant this very precise instrument used in a dark room allowed us to limit noisy light to a minimum level a. about the grating spectrometer considering light as wave we know that white light is a superposition of all the visible colours 3 indeed it is composed of waves of wavelength from 400 nm to 700nm we can decompose any light into its different wavelength using either a prism or a grating in our case we used a grating which is a transparent piece of glass which contained a very large number of equally spaced narrow lines when light shines through a grating it is diffracted by the lines and light changes its path by an angle θ given by 2𝜋 𝜆 d sin 𝜃 2𝜋m 2 1 where 𝜆 is the wavelength of the light d is the spacing between two lines of the grating and m is the number of the ray from the central ray when light goes through an obstacle of a width of the same magnitude as its wavelength it gets diffracted 4 because of this phenomenon of diffraction the rays are displaced from the straight path and appear as thin rays repeating themselves as we turn the telescope the light 's maximum intensity which is the ray we see is located at 2𝜋m m being the number of the ray 2 rearranging 1 we have 2 we can therefore see that a beam of light containing different wavelengths gets separated into rays of a specific wavelength shifted from the straight path by an angle θ depending on their wavelength according to bohr 's model 5 atoms are composed of a central nucleus composed of both protons and neutrons and of a set of layers containing a defined number of electrons depending on the energy they carry the electrons can pass from one `` layer '' called level of energy to another this change of level of energy is called a `` quantum leap '' if the electron jumps from a lower level of energy to a higher one it absorbs energy in the form of a photon particle of light of a particular wavelength reversely an energised electron will quickly 5 return to a lower level of energy by emitting its excess of energy in the form of a photon of the wavelength corresponding to the one of the photon it initially absorbed in the quantum theory everything is quantified that is why we are in presence of specific wavelengths and energy levels the hydrogen lamp functions according to this quantum theory indeed the lamp contains hydrogen atoms see fig 2 that are excited by the heating of the lamp and emit light of specific wavelength when the atoms are deexciting coming back to lower energy level 5 the hydrogen atom emits rays both visible ultraviolet and infrared the visible rays are given by the balmer series 2 and correspond to transitions from the higher energy level 6 th to 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level the visible rays are shown in fig 1. visible wavelengths emitted by a hydrogen atom from left to right the rays correspond to transition from the 6 th to the 2 nd energy level from the 5 th to the 2 nd from the 4 th to the 2 nd and from the 3 rd to the 2 nd 2 c. about the rydberg constant measuring the rydberg constant using a grating spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw the rydberg constant r ∞ relates the transition between level of energy to the wavelength of the emitted or absorbed photon for a transition between level n to level p n p we have where 𝜆 is the wavelength of the emitted photon according to the theory we should be able to distinguish 3 different rays of light with different wavelengths each corresponding to a specific transition in the hydrogen atom we are also supposed to see these rays repeating themselves a few times as we rotate the spectrometer r ∞ is also given by where 𝑚 e is the rest mass of the electron 𝜀 0 is the permittivity of free space 𝑒 is the electron 's charge 𝑐 is the speed of light in vacuum and ℎ is plank 's constant the accepted value for this fundamental constant is 1.097 373 156 8508 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 1 note in the case of the hydrogen atom the value of the rydberg constant is slightly different as it has to take into account the effect of the central proton 6 in the case of the hydrogen atom the rydberg constant r h is given by r h e h hc 6 5 where e h is the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom h is the planck 's constant and c the speed of light in vacuum however the difference is too small to be apprehended at our level of precision and we will therefore calculate r ∞ first of all we had to set up our spectrometer as shown in fig 2. after understanding what the principal pieces were we started to look at the light emitted by a sodium lamp we did not use the hydrogen lamp to set up the apparatus as it heats up quickly and tends to shut down after 15 to 20 minutes of use to determine what was the straight path of light we placed the 78.8 lines/mm grating at 45° of the incoming light we turned the rotating arm of the spectrometer until the light reflected by the grating was visible see ii.a we took note of the position of the arm knowing from the law of reflection that the reflection angle is the same as the incident angle we deducted that our straight path was at 45° to this measurement we deduced that our spectrometer was aligned when the rotating arm was at 349.42° when observing the spectrum of emission of the hydrogen lamp we observed 3 different colours red light blue and purple the purple was harder to see than the other colours rotating our telescope we saw that the rays repeated themselves multiple times as predicted by the theory see ii.a regarding the allocated time and the fact that we could not have the hydrogen lamp light for a very long time we chose to take 3 times the same set of measurements letting the lamp cool down between measurements for each colour we chose to measure the angle of diffraction of the 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd ray going to the left corresponding respectively to 𝑚 1 2 3 and of the corresponding rays going to the right 𝑚 −1 −2 −3 as well as of the central ray 𝑚 0 we therefore aimed to have 21 measurements per colour if we had had more time we would have measured the 4 th ray for each colour to the left and to the right three times for each colour rather than take a fourth time 7 measurements for each colour we are indeed interested in the overall trend of the ratio 𝑚/ sin 𝜃 and not in the particular angle 𝜃 at which is located each ray because of noisy light in the room the purple rays were really faint and hence hard to see sometimes we were not sure if the ray we were observing was the second or the third purple ray another probable source of error is also that we did n't see the difference between two violet wavelengths indeed we saw very faint purple lines and we estimated that they were all of the same wavelength but according to theory we should have had two violet rays we therefore chose to make measurements for the purple rays keeping in mind that they had a higher degree of uncertainty and that we could and probably should not use them when calculating the value of the rydberg constant we tried to get the purple rays as bright as possible by measuring them last when the hydrogen lamp was hotter and the rays brighter as more atoms would deexcite in the same time however it was not good enough we manage to take only one measurement of the rays -2 and 2 and only 2 measurements of the rays -3 and 3. we estimate that we have an error of ±15 arc minutes on measurements -2 and 2 we indeed ca n't determine statistically the error despite poor light conditions the grating spectrometer is overall very precise for this kind of experiment indeed because of the slit situated on the light 's path and because of the process of interference the rays of light are situated in a small region of space this helps in the precision so does the cross-wire see fig 2 two thin black lines crossing each other in the centre of the lenses that help centre the measurement exactly in the centre of the ray another feature of the spectrometer that improves greatly precision is the vernier scale this apparatus is precise to 1 which corresponds to a precision of 0.02° putting together the different measurements and using the statistical method to determine the error we obtained the results shown in table i where 𝜃 blue is the angle of the blue ray subtracting the value of each ray 's position to the value of the central ray we find the relative angle of displacement of each ray taking the sine of the angle of the relative angle of displacement and plotting it against the ray number we obtain the graphs given in fig 3 a b and c using 2 on the measurement summarised in table i the value of d calculated in 5 and obtaining errors using the statistical method we calculated the value of the wavelength of each colour as being 𝜆 red 6.67 ± 0.19 × 10 −7 𝑚 𝜆 blue 4.95 ± 0.05 × 10 −7 𝑚 and 𝜆 purple 4.95 ± 0.31 × 10 −7 𝑚. as we can see our measurements for the purple wavelength seem wrong as they have a higher uncertainty and are not coherent as we calculated the same wavelength for the blue and purple set of rays this comforts the hypothesis made in section iii b that the measurement of purple rays was unprecise and should not be used in further calculations as we have seen in part section ii.b the blue rays correspond to a transition from level 4 to level 2. rearranging 3 we have taking 𝜆 𝜆 blue n=2 and p=4 we can calculate an experimental value of 𝑅 ∞ 𝑅 ∞ blue 1.08 ± 0.01 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 similarly the red rays correspond to a transition from the 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level using 𝜆 red n=2 and p=3 and 6 we find 𝑅 ∞ red 1.08 ± 0.03 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 taking the mean of these two values and the mean error we find our experimental value for the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ exp 1.08 ± 0.02 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 we estimated that the errors come from different sources firstly a part of our errors comes from a move of the grating that resulted in a misalignment of the spectrometer indeed we see that our central ray the one not being deflected is n't always at the same position using statistical mean to calculate error we find that this central ray is located at 168.85 ± 0.05° we can therefore estimate our error as being 0.05° furthermore if the vernier scaled allowed us a great precision it was also sometimes a bit hard to read we consider that we have a random error of ±3 ′ on the measurement using the vernier scale of each angle because of the parallax effect and the bad visibility in the dark room we also estimate that we have an error of ±2.5 on the determination of the rays position indeed we measured that the width of our rays is 10 we consider that we know whether we are closer to one of the border or to the centre of the ray but we ca n't really determine if we are at ¼ of the ray or at ½ of it therefore our error here is the quarter of the rays width 10/4 2.5 we also had sources of error in the fact that the spectrometer might have moved horizontally and would not be exactly in front of the slit anymore this as well as the background lights present in the room during the experiment reduced the relative brightness of the observed rays and caused us to cast out our measurement of the purple rays finally environmental conditions such as the ambient humidity temperature and air pressure probably influenced the behaviour of the hydrogen atoms however they are difficult to estimate and we consider that they are negligible ideally we could determine their magnitude by doing the experiment in different meteorological conditions however it seems really difficult to do it practise because of the multiple varying factors humidity temperature noisy light ... that prevent us from repeating the experiment in the exact same conditions adding all the estimated errors we find an error of 0.14° which corresponds to an error in the wavelength of 0.18 × 10 −7 𝑚 which is smaller than our error on the red wavelength but still of the same order of magnitude we therefore chose our measured values for the errors as they are bigger than the estimated ones the accepted value of the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 1 lies within our margin of error our estimate for the rydberg constant is 𝑅 ∞ exp 1.08 ± 0.02 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 and is coherent with the theory we observed that the hydrogen atom emits only at certain wavelengths which is coherent with the quantum picture and the description of light as a particle in the experiment we also experienced diffraction of light through the grating a phenomenon more easily explained by a wave-like picture of light this experiment is one of the few that relates quantum mechanics to optics allowing us to encounter the wave-particle duality because we used a very precise apparatus we have less than a 2 error in our value for the constant this error comes at 35 from a displacement from alignment at 35 from a unprecise reading of the vernier scale and at 30 from a difficult determination of the rays position the conditions of experience brightness temperature humidity air pressure… played a role as they prevented us from making use of the purple rays as well as being sources of systematic errors however they ca n't be estimated using this sole experiment we could determine their magnitude by repeating the experiment in different meteorological conditions the strengths of this experiment are its precision the comprehensive view of the atom it gives and the link it makes between quantum mechanics and optics thanks to the precise apparatus we used this experiment was successful however it can be strongly improved by making it in a proper dark room with a more powerful hydrogen lamp that would allow us to measure the two purple sets of rays as well as the blue and red ones more precisely calculating the constant using 4 wavelengths would indeed be more precise we could also measure a 4 th and even a 5 th ray from the central ray to improve our precision even further,superficial,the
9,GS_VLS445_Redacted,as of recent times the rydberg is one of the most accurately measured fundamental physical constants this report reviews how the rydberg constant was calculated using a grating spectrometer this was the primary aim of the experiment another aim was to become familiar with a spectrometer and how it can be used in different ways to study spectra a spectrometer was used to analyse a spectrum of light from a known source by taking measurements of the angles between spectra lines and using knowledge of balmer transitions the formula for the rydberg constant was solved a value of 2.088e+07𝒎 −𝟏 +/-1.087e+07𝒎 −𝟏 was obtained he rydberg constant is a fundamental constant which is very important in atomic physics it is named after the swedish physicist johannes rydberg who developed the formula used in this lab report to obtain a value for this constant the constant describes the wavelengths of the photons of light emitted as spectral lines in transitions in the balmer series the easiest atoms to study are the hydrogen due to their simple structure this is why a hydrogen lamp was used in this experiment in the lamp is hot electrically excited hydrogen gas this causes it to emit a spectrum that 's concentrated only at a few specific wavelengths the spacing between these bright lines provides data which can be used to draw many conclusions including the conclusion of this experiment spectroscopy is a highly successful and powerful technique due to the fact that it is non-invasive the other piece of equipment used was the grating spectrometer this is an instrument used to study the spectrum of light emitted by the hydrogen lamp it uses a lens to produce a collimated beam of light a diffraction grating disperses this beam due to its series of very fine grooves cut in its surface the dispersed beam is then focussed by the camera onto the eyepiece of the spectrometer the spectrometer is made up of three components a collimator a diffraction grating and a telescope this is shown in the schematic diagram below the light from the hydrogen lamp enters through an adjustable slit which is used to focus the camera this will be explained in the method the slit is strategically positioned at the focal point of the collimator to ensure that all the light passing through the diffraction grating is one parallel collimated beam of light all beams have the same angle of incidence the diffraction grating is simplified to a large number of equally spaced very narrow slits this causes the beam to disperse and the pattern is picked up at the telescope the diffraction angle depends on the wavelength of the light this is illustrated by the following equation where d is the slit separation sin 𝜃 is the sin of the angle between adjacent emission lines m is an integer and 𝜆 is the specific wavelength of that colour of light this equation implies a straight line when sin 𝜃 is plotted against m. this allows for the wavelengths and their uncertainties to be determined from the gradient and error bars which are calculated using python the diagram below shows the diffraction patter for 4 slits the balmer series is the series of visible lines which a discharge lamp emits the formula to describe these lines was found by johaan balmer and is given by where n and p are integers representing the initial and final states of the atom the value of p for hydrogen is always 2 for balmer transitions therefore this equation can be used to plot to give a straight line the rydberg constant and its uncertainty are calculated from there this phenomenon of why hydrogen only emitted four lines also known as the balmer lines of hydrogen was explained by niels bohr in his model for the atom the electron which orbits the proton can only exist in certain orbital states a quantum number the diagram below shows a visual representation of these transitions the experiment was carried out in a dark room in the laboratory to allow clearer images to seen through the spectrometer and reduce human error the method that was carried out in order to obtain all the data needed is as follows  the first and most important part of the experiment is setting up the spectrometer so that it is in focus  the camera lens was focused on a distant object so that the cross wire was on top of it  then the hydrogen lamp was placed near the slit and the collimator focus was adjusted until a sharp image was shown  in order to ensure that the collimator is aligned at 0 degrees with the camera the telescope was moved through 90 degrees and clamped  then the grating table was turned until a reflected image is seen using a mirror in place of the diffraction grating  at this point the collimator and camera are at 45 degrees from each other the telescope was rotated back through 45 degrees and this gave normal incidence to give the zeroth order measurement  for each colour the telescope is rotated in both directions to look for the 1 st 2 nd etc order emission lines  the angle of each line is recorded  measurements for the error were also taken the width of the line was measured for each line i.e the difference in the angle between the two sides of the strip  this was the greatest source of uncertainty in this experiment and therefore it was the data used to plot the errorbars on the graphs in the results  at first it was thought that the greatest source of error would be from partners recording different angles however when this was compared with the other source of error it was found that the subjective readings were much less significant than the error due to not knowing where to position the cross hair on every line a note regarding the procedure that was followed is that after taking the measurements for the first colour the hydrogen lamp stopped working so it was replaced with another one it was attempted to place it in exactly the same position so that it would not cause the readings for different colours to be inconsistent below are graphs of sin 𝜃 against m for each colour these were used to calculate the wavelengths it can be seen that they all follow straight line trends using python 's poly1fit function the equations for each line of best fit was obtained the uncertainties are included from here the graph to calculate the rydberg constant was plotted the equation for this line is 2.088e+07 x 7.83e+0 the magnitude of the gradient of this graph 2.088e+07𝑚 −1 from earlier error calculations the uncertainty in this gradient is 1.087e+07𝑚 −1 from the above graph it is clear that one point is an anomaly and so it was not included in the calculations the reason it was so far off from the trendline was that the blue light measurement were taken using one lamp whereas the other two were both done using the same lamp although using only 2 points reduces the validity of the experiment conclusions can still be made furthermore the wavelengths obtained are of the same order of magnitude but they are lower than their actual values this was due to a systematic error which in this experiment was human error in reading the angles from the spectrometer the official accepted value for the rydberg constant is 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 the value of 2.088e+07𝑚 −1 +/-1.087e+07𝑚 −1 is of the same order of magnitude as this furthermore the accepted value lies within the error range of the experimental value,superficial,none
10,GS_CYF541_Redacted,the principle purpose of the conducted experiment was to calculate rydberg constant `` r '' the value was found to be r 11123886.85 ± 1317838m -1 this was calculated by means of a spectrometer where hydrogen light was normally incident on a diffraction grating thus separating the different colors of hydrogen a telescope was then used to measure the diffraction angles corresponding to several orders and the wavelengths of the associated colors for the balmer series of hydrogen the balmer series governs the descent of electrons from high energy levels to the second energy level then the rydberg constant was calculated using the three wavelengths of the hydrogen light red violet and blue finally the mean value of the three obtained rydberg constants was obtained and used as the value of the rydberg constant the calculated value of the rydberg constant along with its associated error was within the range of the actual value the difference between the two values can be mainly attributed to different random and instrumental errors which are discussed thoroughly in this report the main aim behind the conducted experiment was to determine `` rydberg '' constant using the spectrum of hydrogen rydberg constant is a fundamental atomic constant which appears in several relationships famously associated with the hydrogen atom and has units of m -1 1 this was determined by studying the diffraction pattern of hydrogen light using a spectrometer a spectrometer is an instrument used to study different phenomena of light 2 see section iii. historically isaac newton in 1666 was the first scientist who demonstrated that sunlight was constituted of several different colors and coined the word `` spectrum '' after that several other scientists including melville and angstrom studied the different spectral lines of different types of light until rydberg in 1890 mathematically derived a formula which included this constant finally bohr showed that it can be expressed in more fundamental terms 3 see section ii. in this experiment the rydberg constant was determined using the relation of associated with the balmer series the balmer series describes the transition of electrons in the hydrogen atom from high energy states to states of n=2 where n is the quantum number the spectral lines considered in this experiment were the lines corresponding to n=3 red wavelength n=4 blue wavelength and n=5 violet wavelength which are in the visible spectrum 4 it is important to note that the balmer series contains several spectral lines which are in the ultraviolet region furthermore determining the different wavelengths of the three spectral lines was based on the phenomenon of diffraction whereby incident light from the source bends when it encounters a diffraction grating 5 the main phenomenon behind this experiment is diffraction of light diffraction of light as mentioned in the introduction section is the phenomenon where a beam of light is spread out when encountering an obstacle grating in this case by geometrically analyzing the pattern obtained the following relationship can be derived where d is the slit separation in meters θ is the angle between two beams of light in radians m is the order number and λ is the wavelength of the incident light in meters as mentioned in the introduction section the balmer series was used to obtain the rydberg constant it is expressed as follows where r ∞ is rydberg constant in m -1 and n and p are integers which represent energy levels of initial and final states respectively the rydberg constant can be expressed in more fundamental constants as where ɑ is a constant me is the electron mass kg c is the speed of light in vacuum m/s and h is planck 's constant joules second furthermore the constant ɑ can be determined using the following formula determination of the rydberg constant using the spectrum of hydrogen where ϵ 0 is the permittivity in free space farad per meter therefore using equation 1 the wavelengths of the three spectral lines red blue and violet were calculated by plotting three fits of sin θ vs the order m where the slopes of these plots represent λ/d hence from equation 2 and noting that the value of p in the balmer series is 2 rydberg constant was determined the first step in the experiment was to adequately align the spectrometer first the eyepiece was focused on the cross wire by viewing the image of a distant object the window of the building facing the lab a sodium lamp was then used for the purpose of positioning the telescope so that it was aligned with the axis of the collimator after that the telescope was moved 90 degrees the vernier scale was used to measure the angles and a grating was placed in the holder the table was turned until a reflected image was seen which indicates that it was at an angle of 45 degrees finally the grating was placed so that the beam was at normal incidence and then the telescope was positioned back to face the grating the sodium lamp was replaced by the hydrogen lamp to start obtaining data in order to determine rydberg constant the diffraction pattern of the hydrogen light was observed the telescope was used to observe the different spectral lines at different orders negative and positive orders the starting position was the zeroth order which had all three spectral lines red blue and violet overlapped then for the red and blue spectral lines the angles of the orders from m=-4 to m=4 were measured by reading the vernier scale however for the violet spectral line we were only able to observe the orders from m=-2 to m=2 it is also important to note that the error in the vernier scale was taken to be ±0.5 arcminute after obtaining the data a plot was created using python for three fits for the three different spectral lines of sin θ vs the order m from which the wavelengths of the lights were obtained from these three different wavelengths three different values of the rydberg constant were obtained and the mean and error of the values were calculated using python as well 6 the experimental data obtained in this experiment were diffraction angles for the three different spectral lines of hydrogen at different negative and positive orders hence a graph of sin θ vs the order m was obtained graph 1 the plots of the three spectral lines of hydrogen red blue and violet of equations y 0.05164x -0.002256 y 0.03728x 0.007478 and y 0.03377x -0.00164 respectively the three plots show a linear straight line as expected from the relation represented in equation 1 from the slope of the three fits the wavelengths of the spectral lines were calculated as follows similarly λviolet 473 nm and λviolet 428 nm hence using the three values of the wavelengths three values of the rydberg constant were obtained from equation 2 it is important to note that the values for n for the red blue and violet wavelengths were 3 4 and 5 respectively 7 the values of the rydberg constant were rred 10986831.91m -1 rblue 11273247.5m -1 and rviolet 11111581.14m -1 thus the mean value of the rydberg constant was calculated to be r 11123886.85m -1 associated uncertainty calculated in the following section using python the error in the slope of the three fits was estimated and hence the error in the wavelengths was calculated then δλred 8.1 nm similarly δλblue 54.8 nm and δλviolet 4.29 nm where the symbol δ means the error of correspondingly the errors in the three rydberg constants were δrred 135867 1306076 and δrviolet 111375. thus the error in the mean rydberg constant was δr 111375 this was calculated using the formula of the standard deviation and the number n of the dataset therefore the value of the rydberg constant obtained was r 11123886.85 ± 1317838. the calculated value of the rydberg constant along with its error lie within the range of the accepted value which is r 10973731.6 m -1 this indicates that the value was relatively accurate but does not rule out the possibility of the existence of systematic errors equation 1 indicates that y-intercept of such fits should be zero which does not agree with the results although the y-intercept is small this is also the result of the existence of several sources of error there were several sources of error in the conducted experiment which explain the difference between the calculated value and the actual one first of all errors in measuring the diffraction angle due to the instrumental error of the vernier scale which was estimated to be 1 arc minute furthermore parallax errors were taken into consideration due to the difficulty in reading such small values at different angles to reduce parallax errors my lab partner and i tried to separately do the readings from the same angle for all measurements several outer sources of error were present including light from neighboring experiments this was mainly evident when observing the violet spectral lines were upon turning off the light from neighboring experiments two more orders became clearly observed concerning systematic errors some possible sources of error include the calibration of the spectrometer in other words the positioning of the telescope or grating might not have been exactly as required which therefore would have affected all the obtained measurements additionally the eyepiece of the spectrometer was opened in order to see larger beams of light this in turn made it more difficult to see where exactly the spectral line was aligned with the cross wire moreover influence from external sources light from outside might also have resulted in affecting all the measurements finally possibly the major factor which explains the difference between the two values would be the number of data points obtained especially in the violet spectral line we were only able to obtain angles for 4 orders from m=-2 to m=2 which would decrease the accuracy of the results it should be noted that all the above uncertainties were taken into consideration and expressed as error bars in graph 1 above the main aim of the conducted experiment was to calculate the value of rydberg constant the major result was therefore the r 11123886.85 ± 1317838 m -1 the calculated value of the along with its error lie within the range of the actual value of the rydberg constant the key successes in the experiment were mainly being able to measure the diffraction angles the wavelengths of the spectral lines and thus the rydberg constant the main shortcoming was the rather large random error associated with the value of the rydberg constant this can be attributed to instrumental and random errors related o the measurements taken and possibly also to systematic errors mainly due the calibration of the spectrometer there are several ways to improve the result the main method to follow would be to obtain more data points this could be done by eliminating almost all possible sources of light which would enable us to observe higher orders of diffraction both on the negative and positive side furthermore using a more advanced spectrometer which would show a clearer diffraction pattern would also result in showing more orders a more advanced spectrometer would also ensure that the spectral line would almost be exactly aligned on the cross wire which would increase the accuracy of the measured angles this experiment proved that by using the spectrometer to observe the diffraction of hydrogen light we are able to calculate to a relatively high degree of accuracy a fundamental constant in atomic physics,superficial,bal
11,GS_FHG790_Redacted,a grating spectrometer was used to measure the wavelengths of the most prominent spectral lines produced by a hydrogen lamp the values obtained for the wavelengths of h⍺ hβ and hγ were then used to calculate a value for the rydberg constant r∞ this experiment resulted in a value for the rydberg constant as 10860000 ± 31690 m -1 as opposed to the literature value of 10973731.568508 m -1 because it is expressible as a product of many of the fundamental constants of physics as a result many experiments have been devised and carried out to make it one of the most precisely known physical constants as this places constraints on the ratios of the quantities that define it in this experiment light emitted by a hydrogen lamp is passed through a slit and then collimated before being diffracted the angle through which each wavelength of light gets diffracted is measured for as many orders as they remain visible fro m this data the wavelengths of the light present in the spectrum can be calculated which in turn can be used to obtain a value for the rydberg constant r∞ if a gas is electrically excited it emits radiation at a few specific well-defined wavelengths the wavelengths that are present depend on the energy levels within the atoms of the substance producing the spectrum this is because as an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one it loses energy by emitting a photon the energy of the photon is equal to the difference in energy between the two levels if only one atom were present then only one emission lin e would be visible at any one time however as there is a copious amount of hydrogen all the emission lines are present with differing intensities dictated by the relative abundance of atoms in each initial state this ratio of the spectral line intensities is mostly dependent on the temperature of the gas emitting the light for hydrogen the wavelengths that comprise its emission spectrum are given by the remarkably simple rydberg formula λ is the wavelength of the emitted light in m r∞ is the rydberg constant in m -1 n is the initial state of the hydrogen atom and p is the final state of the hydrogen atom both n and p are unitless integers as previously mentioned the rydberg constant can be expressed in terms of many physical constants where ⍺ is the fine structure constant which is unitless me is the mass of the electron in kg and h is planck 's constant in js ⍺ is also expressible as a product of several physical constants where e is the magnitude of the charge on an electron

hydrogens emission spectrum that correspond to an electron transitioning from a higher energy level n 2 down to p 2. the balmer series is used for this experiment because the wavelengths of the first

shown in fig 3 adjusting the colli.i mtor and ensuring that the light is at nonml incidence to the diffraction grating firstly the eyepiece was focussed on the cross hairs so that the iimge was at a distance that didn 't strain our eyes when looking through the telescope for long periods of tiire tue carrera lens of the telescope then had to be focussed so that there was no parallax between a distant iimge and the cross hairs tue hydrogen ian~ was positioned close to the slit and the focus of the colli.i mtor was then changed to fonn a shaip iimge of the slit which was then aligned v.iith the cross hairs tue size of the slit was also adjusted so that it was as thin as possible whilst still allowing us see when the cross hairs were aligned v.iith it using the scale on the turntable the telescope was then rotated through 90° -so that it was then pointing pe1pendicular to the colli.i mtor a min-or was then placed on the diffraction grating m mnt and rotated until the iimge of the slit was centred on the cross hairs tue diffraction grating m mnt was then rotated through 45° so that the light from the colfumtor was now at nonml incidence to it tue miiror was replaced on the stand by a diffraction grating the orientation of the diffraction grating then had to be adjusted so that the iimge of the slit was ve1t ical when viewed through the telescope tue telescope was then positioned so that the central rmxiimm was aligned v.iith the cross hairs and the reading on the vernier scale p was recorded tue grating spectrorreter was then used to 1reasure the angle at which each order appeared for each wavelength until the spectral lines were no longer visible tue angle p was then subtracted from these values to obtain the angle through which each order had been diffracted by the grating during the ei :periirent three dis tinct colours of light were visib le red aqua and blue these equate to the first three hydrogen balrrer lines ha and hy for the red and aqua light readings of the angle were taken for the first 5 orders either side of the central rmximu m. however v.iith the blue light the thii-d order was missed upon the analysis it becarre clear that this was because the angle that it should have been diffracted by was ve1y close to the angle obtained for the second order of the red lightv.iithin approxirmtely 0.1 ° therefore we could deduce that it had been 'drowned out by the red as the red light was by far the brighter of the two from eq 5 it becorres apparent that there is a linear relationship between the order and the sine of the diffraction angle llllhiplied by the slit separation of the diffraction grating therefore plotting a graph of d sin 0 against order should give a straight line through the origin v.iith the gradient being equal to the wavelength of the light using this method with our data results in values of h⍺ hβ and hγ as 661 ± 1.60 nm 493 ± 3.61nm and 438 ± 1.97 nm respectively these values are all greater than their literature values by a similar amount -5nm 7nm and 4nm this shows that there is an error of a systematic nature that is affecting our results there are many possible sources of error in this experiment with two of the most influential being a misalignment of the spectrometer and the human error involved in reading the vernier scale other smaller sources of error include the grating period and the fact that the refractive index of air is n't 1. calculating a value for the rydberg constant with the value of each wavelength in turn results in r∞ 10890000 ± 26380 m -1 r∞ 10810000 ± 79020 m-1 and r∞ 10870000 ± 48820 m -1 to obtain a final value for the rydberg constant the mean of the values obtained is taken to find the uncertainty in this value the following formula is used where 𝜎 m is the best estimate of the random error on the mean s is the sample standard deviation and n is the number of measurements this results in a value of the rydberg constant of 10860000 ± 31690 m -1 a percentage uncertainty of 0.29 the accepted value of the rydberg constant is 10973731.568508 m -1 with a relative standard uncertainty of 5.9 × 10 −12 2 the aim of the experiment was to obtain a value for the rydberg constant by measuring the wavelengths of the hydrogen balmer lines using a grating spectrometer this resulted in a value for r∞ of 10860000 ± 31690 m -1 as opposed to the literature value of 10973731.568508 m -1 with a relative standard uncertainty of 5.9 × 10 −12 our value disagrees with the accepted value by 1.1 which is outside our experimental uncertainty in a future similar experiment more preliminary data should be taken and analysed as this would allow for systematic errors to be lowered as the equipment could be reset if they were noticed also more wavelengths of light should be included as this will reduce the uncertainty in the final result,superficial,the

method was not used for these measurements these data give a wavelength of 429.0 ± 0.7 nm and hence n 5. a value for the rydberg constant r∞ was calculated as 1.110 ± 0.002 × 10 7 m −1 the accepted value of r∞ does not lie within the range given by the estimated uncertainty thus the combined uncertainty was calculated as the uncertainty due to the vernier scale and the uncertainty given by the width of the emission line added in quadrature the second run of data collection utilised the new `` in/out '' method of measurement in an attempt to better estimate the uncertainty in the measurements of θ. run 2 -red -preliminary data `` red '' fit `` red '' data fig 7. graphed results from first data run red emission line this was the preliminary data recorded using the newly developed in/out method as before there is clearly a strong correlation between the two variables the uncertainty for m 0 is due to the fact that two central emission lines were visible a cyan and a red at the centre they merged but it was difficult to determine whether these emission lines should be treated as one or as two slightly separated emission lines for this point they were treated as one thus increasing the emission line width and therefore the uncertainty in the measurement of θ. these data give a wavelength of 654.7 ± 0.2 nm and hence n 3. a value for the rydberg constant r∞ was calculated as 1.0997 ± 0.0004 × 10 7 m −1 the accepted value of r∞ does not lie within the range given by the estimated uncertainty this new method has successfully reduced the uncertainty in the measurement however the value calculated for r∞ does not agree with the accepted value run 2 -red -definitive data `` red '' fit `` red '' data fig 8. graphed results from first data run red emission line this was the definitive data recorded using the newly developed in/out method here the uncertainty was increased as the slit was widened in an attempt to increase the intensity of the emission lines however at larger |m| the emission line was much harder to see for m 2 this issue prevented a measurement being taken these data give a wavelength of 654.0 ± 0.4 nm and hence n 3. a value for the rydberg constant r∞ was calculated as 1.1009 ± 0.0007 ×10 7 m −1 the accepted value of r∞ does not lie within the range given by the estimated uncertainty during the second run of the experiment an orange emission line was seen along with the red and cyan run 2 -cyan -definitive data `` cyan '' fit `` cyan '' data fig 9. graphed results from first data run cyan emission line this was the definitive data recorded using the newly developed in/out method here the uncertainty was increased as the slit was again widened in an attempt to increase the intensity of the emission lines again however at larger |m| the emission line was much harder to see and for m 2 this issue prevented a measurement being taken these data give a wavelength of 484.6 ± 0.1 nm and hence n 4. a value for the rydberg constant r∞ was calculated as 1.1006 ± 0.0002 × 10 7 m −1 the accepted value of r∞ does not lie within the range given by the estimated uncertainty lines since hydrogen does not have an orange coloured emission line this line was measured and a wavelength of 587.5 ± 0.3 nm was recorded the data for this line is outlined in figure 10. the origin of this orange emission line is unknown perhaps it originated from some out-gassing from the walls of the hydrogen vapour lamp due to the high temperature inside although this does seem very unlikely an experiment studying the emission spectrum of nacl solution flame tests had been carried out with the equipment before this data run had been carried out although this did not seem to have affected the equipment in any way two final values for the rydberg constant were calculated one for each run of the experiment but taking the means of both the calculated values and their uncertainties for the first run of the experiment a final value of 1.111 ± 0.006 × 10 7 m −1 was calculated and can be seen plotted in figure 11 as `` average run 1 '' for the second run of the experiment a final value of 1.1004±0.0004 ×10 7 m −1 was calculated and can also be seen plotted in figure 11 as `` average run 2 '' as can be seen in figure 11 the accepted value for r ∞ does not fall within any of the ranges defined by the calculated values and their respective uncertainties however the data collected from each run are clearly quite different run 2 -orange -definitive data `` orange '' fit `` orange '' data fig 10. graphed results from first data run orange emission line this was the definitive data recorded using the newly developed in/out method interestingly an orange emission line was observed in the hydrogen emission spectrum there does not exist an orange emission line hence this was measured in order to record a wavelength such that this emission line could later be looked up this emission line was the brightest and clearest of the three observed during the definitive data run these data give a wavelength of 587.5 ± 0.3 nm from a previous experiment in which the emission line of sodium was measured as 587.7 ± 0.4 nm using a sodium vapour lamp and 587.6 ± 0.4 nm using a nacl flame test -both of these measurements used the in/out method this emission line was clearly identified as sodium j. sansonetti gives this emission line of sodium as 588.9950954 ± 0.0000015 nm 5 data from the first run are less precise and also less accurate than data from the second run furthermore the uncertainties for the measurements taken in the first run are clearly larger in magnitude than the uncertainties for the measurements taken in the second run the reason for this is unknown however it is hypothesised that the stark difference in each data set 's accuracy is due to the alignment of the spectrometer before the data were collected during the alignment process for the first run of the experiment explained in section iii when the grating was turned by precisely 45 • such that it was meant to be at 90 • to the centre line it was clearly not this perplexed us and the alignment process was attempted again upon repeating the alignment process the grating was still not perfectly aligned however we attempted to continue with the experiment for the second run the same issue occurred again however this time the effect was much less pronounced although the grating did not seem to be at exactly 90 • to the centre line of the collimator the hypothesis is the data from the first run is less accurate more spread out because the spectrometer was more misaligned whereas the data from the second run is more accurate less spread out because the spectrometer was less misaligned in this experiment the rydberg constant for hydrogen was calculated as 1.1004 ± 0.0004 × 10 7 m −1 using angle measurements taken with a grating spectrometer a hydrogen vapour lamp was used as the light source in order to observe fig 11. all of the calculated values for the rydberg constant values from run 1 have a larger spread than those from run 2. also the values from run 1 have much wider uncertainties than from run 2 run 2 used the in/out method whereas run 1 did not averages means were taken of the calculated values for run 1 run 2 and for all of the values these values are also plotted alongside the individual emission line calculations for reference the accepted value for r∞ has been plotted 1.09737316 × 10 7 m −1 1 the accepted value for r∞ does not lie within any of the ranges defined by the calculated values uncertainties the emission spectrum of hydrogen using the equipment the experiment was run twice since a novel method for determining the centres of the emission lines observed was developed after the first run of the experiment was completed the data from the first run were much less accurate and precise than those of the second run and this is clearly visible in figure 11. hence as the mean of the second data run was much more precise and accurate than that of the first this was selected as the final value for the rydberg constant as calculated in this experiment unusually during data collection for the second repeat of the experiment an orange emission line was observed in the emission spectrum of hydrogen there does not exist an orange coloured emission line the wavelength of this emission line was measured as 587.5 ± 0.3 nm confirming it as originating from sodium in a previous experiment using the same equipment the wavelength of the emission line from a sodium vapour lamp was recorded as 587.7 ± 0.4 nm and the wavelength of the emission line from a flame test of a nacl solution was recorded as 587.6 ± 0.4 nm the origin of this emission line is unknown a possible explanation could be out-gassing from the walls of the hydrogen vapour lamp although this does seem to be an unlikely scenario for this experiment a visual grating spectrometer was used to make the measurements other spectrometer designs exist such as a computer-aided grating spectrometer in which the eyepiece is replaced with a detector array usually a ccd or cmos sensor the benefits of using a computer-aided spectrometer over a visual grating spectrometer have already been investigated 6 in this investigation it was found that there was no significant improvement or reduction in the uncertainty of the measurement when using a computer-aided spectrometer thus this experiment would not be improved through this suggestion however if the experiment were to be repeated again much more care should be taken in aligning the spectrometer when carrying out this experiment the spectrometer did not appear perfectly aligned before the first data set was recorded before the second data set was recorded the spectrometer was aligned much more carefully however the alignment was still not perfect it was hypothesised that the misalignment of the spectrometer explains the difference in accuracy between the two separate runs of the experiment in order to further reduce the errors in measuring the angles of the maxima in the spectra a diffraction grating with a higher number of lines/mm could have been used such that the angles separating the orders of the spectra would be larger thus the uncertainty in determining the small changes in the angle on the vernier scale would have been further reduced combined with the `` in/out '' method of measurement developed the uncertainty could be reduced to an even better range more repetitions of the experiment could improve the final mean value taken for r ∞ as long as the spectrometer was correctly aligned when carrying out the experiment it is important to make detailed notes on the alignment procedure so that during data analysis it is possible to notice any issues that may have arisen,superficial,none
13,GS_LZH215_Redacted,abstract-the main aim of this experiment was to determine the value of the rydberg constant this was done by finding the wavelength of the spectral lines associated with the balmer series in a hydrogen atom this was found by using the principle of diffraction the spectral lines were diffracted through a diffraction grating in a grating spectrometer then by knowing the energy level transition associated with these spectral lines and by using the rydberg formula for hydrogen atoms the rydberg constant was calculated our measured value for the rydberg constant was 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value gave a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 1 due to the small percentage error but an uncertainty which does n't include the accepted value with slight improvement this method can produce accurate and precise measurement for the rydberg constant however in its current state the procedure gives results which do n't agree with the accepted value the main reason for this inaccuracy was that it was difficult to read the scale on the grating spectrometer as it was too small this was not helped by the fact that we had to constantly squint our eyes to try to read the values from the scale with only a very bright desk lamp over the scale if a digital grating spectrometer was used then the measurement would be much more accurate he bohr model of the atom describes negatively charged electrons in orbit of a positively charged central nucleus at particular radii at these radii the electrons only have discrete values of energy called energy levels the electrons can remain indefinitely in the energy level without emitting radiation and losing energy if the electrons are given the correct amount of energy they can jump to a higher energy level if this occurs the electron is said to be excited energy can be transferred to the electron is several ways including absorbing a photon of electromagnetic radiation which has energy exactly equal to the difference between the two energy levels if enough energy is given to the electron it will escape the electrostatic force of attraction of the positively charged nucleus and the atom will be ionised the rydberg constant is the wavenumber inverse wavelength of the photon of the lowest energy which will cause the ionisation of a hydrogen atom it was first used by swedish physicist johannes rydberg in 1890. it is one of the most accurately measured fundamental physical constants with accepted measured value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 ± 5.9x10 -10 1 however it can be expressed as a combination of other physical constants where me is the mass of an electron e is the charge of an electron h is planks constant c is the speed of light and ε0 is the permittivity of free space due to the number of fundamental physical constants which define the rydberg constant it is very important and powerful constant in particular it can be used to find the energy levels within any atom of a known element this experiment will find a value for the rydberg constant by finding the wavelength of spectral lines using the principle of diffraction in the hydrogen vapour lamps being used a large potential difference is put across the hydrogen vapour this causes electrons from the cathode at one end of the vapour tube to travel across it to the anode at the other end of the tube these electrons collide with the electron in the hydrogen atoms transferring energy to them this causes the electron in the hydrogen atom to gain more energy and thus move into a higher energy level becoming excited the excited electrons will eventually jump back to the ground state the lowest energy level this is called deexcitation the electrons can jump to a lower energy level by releasing a photon of electromagnetic radiation with energy equivalent to the difference between the energy levels same energy of photon that would be required to excite the electron between the two energy levels an excited electron can deexcite directly to the ground state or indirectly by descending to lower energy levels first this means that lesser energy photons can be released by the de-excitation the energy of a photon e is dependent on its frequency f and is given by the relationship 𝐸 ℎ𝑓 2 where h is planks constant and has a value of 6.626070040 × 10 −34 js thus as electrons de-excite many different wavelengths of photons are produced which correspond to the different energy level transitions measuring the rydberg constant using a grating spectrometer t for a hydrogen atom which has only one electron it has been observed that for all the transitions to the second energy level the corresponding photon for each transition has a wavelength in the visible light spectrum it can thus be observed these photons are called the balmer series this can be observed in the energy level diagram below in figure 1. if these photons in are refracted through a prism an emission spectrum will be produced as shown in figure 2 below each line of the spectrum is called a spectral line each line corresponds to different frequency of photons which are released in de-excitation and are in the visible light frequency range emission spectra can also be produced with diffraction gratings a diffraction grating is a plate with multiple parallel slits on it in grating spectrometers the photons released from the hydrogen lamps are directed into the spectrometer where they pass through the diffraction grating the photons passing through adjacent slits interact with each other causing constructive inference in some place and destructive interference in others producing a pattern seen in figure 3 below the central beam is referred to as the zeroth order and is in the same direction as the incident ray the orders increase with increasing angle from the central beam the relationship between the order and the angle of its diffraction is sin 𝜃 𝑁𝜆𝑚 3 where θ is the angle of diffraction of the order angle of order relative to central beam n is the number of slits per metre on the diffraction grating λ is the wavelength of the photon and m is the order of the beam if a graph of sin θ against order m is plotted the wavelength of the spectral line can be found by dividing the gradient of the by the number of slits per metre in the diffraction grating n the graph produced should be a straight line with a positive gradient the rydberg constant 𝑅 can be calculated using the wavelength of the spectral line and the rydberg formula shown below where λ is the wavelength of the photon emitted n is the initial energy level and p is the final energy level of the electron as we are measuring balmer series spectral lines the final energy level is always the second energy level so the formula can be manipulated to in this experiment we are using the red and blue spectral lines as they are most prominent thus by looking at figure 1 and figure 2 on the left we can see the red spectral lines are due to the transition from 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level this is because the red spectral line has the highest frequency lowest energy of all the visible spectral lines produced thus we can also see the blue spectral line are due to the electron transitioning from the 4 th to the 2 nd energy level this is because the blue spectral line has the second highest frequency second lowest energy of all the visible spectral lines produced thus we set up the grating spectrometer as shown in the lab manual except a sodium lamp was used to calibrate it and the main scale was in 0.5º in doing so we ensured that the crosshair was rotated to the `` x '' positon the telescope was in focus with the image of the spectral lines and the diffraction grating was perpendicular to the incident source this is shown in figure 4 of the experimental setup we then placed the hydrogen lamp in front of the slit on the grating spectrometer i looked through the eye piece lens on the grating spectrometer and found the zeroth spectral line this was identified as the brightest spectral line which was about 180º with the lamp and had all the different wavelength spectral lines overlapping we recorded the angle of the zeroth order spectral line by turning the eyepiece lens such that the cross hair was in the middle of the spectral line this measurement was used as a reference measurement ø0 i then measured the angle ø of the red spectral lines from order -4 to 4. were the positive orders were those anticlockwise of the zeroth order and the negative orders were clockwise of the zeroth order as shown in the figure 5. this was then repeated by my lab partner and an average angle for each order was calculated we then calculated the relative angle of the spectral line to the zeroth order θ by subtracting the angle of the zeroth order spectral line from the average angle of each order we then plotted a graph of sin θ against the order for the red spectral lines and measured the gradient of the best line of fit we then divided the gradient by the grating spacing to obtain the wavelength of the spectral line this was then repeated for the blue spectral lines the value for the wavelength of the red spectral line was inputted into equation 6 to find a value of the rydberg constant the value for the wavelength of the blue spectral line was inputted into equation 7 to find another value of the rydberg constant these values were averaged to produce an average value for the rydberg constant from this method this was compared to the accepted value the graph produced from the red spectral line is shown below in figure 6. this graph shows a positive correlation between sin θ and the order of the beam the graph had a gradient of 0.0532 ± 0.0013. when this was multiplied by the grating spacing 78.8 lines per mm it was found the wavelength of the red spectral line was 6.756x10 -7 ± 1.68x10 -8 m. when this was inputted into equation 6 below it was found that the rydberg constant was 10657641.3 ± 265669.6 m -1 the graph produced from the blue spectral line is shown this graph shows a positive correlation between sin θ and the order of the beam the graph had a gradient of 0.0385 ± 0.0002. when this was multiplied by the grating spacing 78.8 lines per mm it was found the wavelength of the blue spectral line was 4.890x10 -7 ± 3.0x10 -9 m. when this was inputted into equation 7 below it was found that the rydberg constant was 10906793.3 ± 67911.9 m -1 when these values where averaged our measured value for the rydberg constant was 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value gave a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 as we can see from both these graphs the uncertainty in sin θ was small as the uncertainty in the measurement of θ was 2 3 ° this meant the uncertainty in sin θ was given by the expression the small uncertainty in sin θ led to a small uncertainty in the wavelength of the spectral line λ given by the expression thus the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for each wavelength is given by the expression where n is the initial energy level thus the uncertainty in the average value of the rydberg constant was even though the uncertainty seems large it is relativity small when compared to the magnitude of the rydberg constant moreover our measured value had a small percentage error of 1.745 however our uncertainty does include the accepted value thus our measured value disagrees with the accepted value the aim of this experiment was to determine the rydberg constant this was done by finding the wavelength of the spectral lines associated with the balmer series we found this by the principle of diffraction as different wavelength of photons will diffract through a diffraction grating by different angles from this we measured the rydberg constant as 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value gave a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 due to the small percentage error but an uncertainty which does n't include the accepted value with slight improvement this method can produce accurate and precise measurement for the rydberg constant however in its current state the procedure gives results which do n't agree with the accepted value the main reason for this inaccuracy was that it was difficult to read the scale on the grating spectrometer as it was too small this was not helped by the fact that we had to constantly squint our eyes to try to read the values of the scale with only a very bright desk lamp over the scale if a digital grating spectrometer was used then the measurement would be much more accurate furthermore it was difficult to place the crosshair in the centre of the spectral line when it was rotated to the `` x '' position i feel it might have been easier to place the crosshair in the centre if it was rotated to the `` '' position this adjustment would try and use the vertical line of the `` '' to bisect the spectral line by moving the telescope when the spectral line is bisected the crosshair would be in the middle of the spectral line moreover this inaccuracy could be due to the fact the hydrogen vapour lamp continued to overheat which caused the spectral lines to slowly fade as the intensity of the spectral lines decreased it became more difficult to see through the telescope and thus more difficult to take accurate readings this problem could be eliminated by using hydrogen vapour lamps with better cooling we also considered the width of the spectral line as possible uncertainty however when we attempted to measure the width it was too small to measure with the scale on the grating spectrometer due to the fact the grating spectrometer is a very precise measuring device the width of the spectral line was considered a negligible if a wider slit was used the spectral line would have been wider and thus the width may not have been negligible however this would have caused the sharpness and contrast of the line to be lost meaning it would have been more difficult to take accurate readings 1 http

14,GS_SZB587_Redacted,"we have used diffraction grating spectrometry to measure the wavelength of the spectral lines of hydrogen and determine the rydberg constant we have found the spectral lines to correspond to the balmer series with wavelengths of 660±10 nm for the red light and 490± 6 nm for the green light we calculated the rydberg constant heavy nuclei in air which we found to be 1090 ± 10 × 10 4 m −1 our measurement is 0.637 off the currently accepted value of 10973731.56859 10 ±9 × 10 −10 m −1 for the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 off the calculated value of 10960797 ± 10 m −1 for the rydberg constant in air both accepted values are within our range of uncertainty t he rydberg constant relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of an atom during electron transitions to the the numbers denoting the energy levels between which the electron transitions rydberg measured this constant to be 107,921.6 cm -1 1 the rydberg was first measured experimentally by janne rydberg as a constant common to each spectral series for the hydrogen atom 1 however this constant also arises as a consequence of a fundamental quantum mechanical effect namely the quantisation of energy levels of the atom by applying the quantum mechanical atomic model to the hydrogen atom and quantising its electron energy levels niels bohr was able to derive the rydberg constant theoretically 2 therefore the calculation of the rydberg constant was not only of importance to spectrometry but to the verification of the quantum mechanical model of the atom proposed by bohr contrary to rydberg 's initial assumption the actual value of the rydberg constant varies between elements depending on the mass of their nuclei 1 however for elements whose nuclei are much heavier than an electron the rydberg factor r ∞ is approximately constant the rydberg constant for heavy atoms has been measured experimentally to a high accuracy to be r ∞ 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 -10 m -1 3 in this experiment we aim to measure the rydberg constant using diffraction grating spectrometry we will examine the spectral emission lines of hydrogen through a grating spectrometer and consequently determine the wavelength of the emission lines this will allow us to calculate a value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each wavelength we will then calculate a mean measurement of r h and use it to calculate r ∞ we compare our measured value to curently accepted values of the rydberg constant as well as discuss the conditions affecting the constant such as the permittivity of free space. the main apparatus used in this experiment is a grating spectrometer a hydrogen lamp is used to excite hydrogen atoms in order to radiate light the grating spectrometer collimates light coming from the source through the collimator and directs it through a diffraction grating each wavelength of light diffracts at a different angle thus we achieve a separation of the spectral lines of hydrogen emission the angle at which the light ray is diffracted is a periodic function of the wavelength as shown in fig 2. the difference between the paths of the light rays diffracted at two adjacent slits distance d apart to the same point on a plane l away from the grating is then from fig 1 equal to r 1 − r 2 thus if the angle between the line connecting the midpoint between the slits and the point on the plane of incidence is θ then if the slit separation d is small enough compared to separation of the planes l then r 2 r 1 is approximately true now as r 1 r 2 the path difference is therefore dsin θ assuming d l and slit width d then θ θ which is the angular displacement between the consecutive orders. if the two light rays are to interfere constructively the path difference between them must be an integer multiple of the wavelength therefore where m is the order of maximum intensity and λ is the wavelength plotting sine of the angular displace for each order against the order number we obtain a straight line whose gradient is λ/d and as we know the separation d we can calculate the value of λ for each spectral line the rydberg constant is an empirical constant calculated upon analysing the spectral line series of an element such as the balmer series for hydrogen emission spectra 5 these series take the form where λ is the wavelength of radiation r ∞ is the rydberg constant for heavy elements and n f and n i are integers characterising the spectral line and the series respectively 6 however the rydberg constant also arises when bohr 's quantum mechanical theory of the atom 1 is applied to the hydrogen atom 2 bohr 's derivation is based upon planck 's theory of the quantisation of radiation from an atom which states that atoms only radiate energy which are integer multiples of a fundamental quantity this may be mathematically written as follows where e is the radiation energy ν is it 's frequency h is planck 's constant and n is an integer multiple 8 9 bohr 's model proposes that electrons can exist in stable quantised circular 2 orbits around the atom without radiating energy where the centripetal force is provided by the coulomb attraction force therefore if an electron transitions from a higher energy n th i orbit to a lower energy n th f orbit then by considering the energy of each orbit as the sum of the potential and kinetic energy of the electron the difference in energy between the orbits ∆e is then given by 3 where m e is the electron mass e is the electron charge 0 is the permittivity of free space and h being planck 's constant 10 as the difference in energy is equal to the frequency of radiation multiplied by planck 's constant 8 where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and λ is the wavelength of radiation finally we get where with r ∞ being the rydberg constant for large nuclei as the ratio of the mass of the electron to the proton is too large compared to the accuracy of the measurement of the rydberg constant the ratio being approximately m p /m e 1836 11 the mass of the proton must be taken into account when finding the rydberg constant for hydrogen this is in order to account for the motion of the nucleus however all that is needed to account for the difference is to replace the term m e with µ where µ is the reduced mass for the protonelectron system 12 where with m n being the mass of the proton or the nucleus thus our calculated value of rydberg constant becomes r h denotes the rydberg 's constant for the hydrogen atom which is in fact the value of rydberg constant we will measure from the gradient of the graph of our experiment to obtain the value of r ∞ we use the following equation this experiment was performed using a spectrometer and hydrogen lamp light from the hydrogen lamp is passed through a light collimator which directs the light ray through the diffraction grating and into a telescope the spectrometer 's telescope was focused using an object 5 meter away to ensure sharpness of image a sodium lamp was used to align the collimator and telescope with the slit using the telescope 's cross-hair the width of the slit was chosen as a compromise between light intensity and sharpness of image the diffraction grating was then adjusted to be perpendicular to the path of light between the collimator and telescope this was done by turning the telescope by exactly 90 degrees from original alignment position with a mirror instead of the diffraction grating in place the mirror was then adjusted until it was at exactly 45 degrees to the telescope with the image from the mirror exactly at the centre of the cross-hair the mirror was then turned by 45 degrees opposite to ensure it 's perpendicular to original aligned line of sight the mirror was then replaced with the grating and telescope was turned back to original position the orientation of the grating in the vertical plane was also adjusted by adjusting the height and orientation of the grating stage so that the light ray passes exactly through the centre of the grating and appears in the centre of the telescope lens this was tested by checking that the image did not tilt or move up or down as the telescope is rotated the adjustments were done in order to prevent the diffracted light ray from deviating vertically away from the plane of the telescope lens as well as tilting of the image which would increase uncertainty in its position another reason for ensuring alignment is to prevent the light ray from hitting the telescope at an angle to the horizontal plane which would reduce the accuracy of our approximate model in equation 2 a number of diffraction gratings with different number of slits per millimetre were tried to find the optimal grating to use for our experiment for each grating the angle between the first two maxima was measured as displayed in table 1. we settled on the 300 slits per millimetre grating as a compromise between having a suitable number of maxima per degree turn while each degree turn being itself large enough in order to reduce the uncertainty as well as having large enough resolving power for each spectral line the telescope was turned in both directions to measure the angle between the initial position and the maxima of each order as shown in fig 2. for each maxima the angular width of the image appearing in the telescope was measured twice by my lab partner and myself and the average width calculated to determine the uncertainty in our angular measurements for each wavelength we only took 5 measurements as beyond that the light was too dim to take any more accurate measurement of the angular displacement iv results 1 wavelengths of spectral lines as we plotted sine of the angular displacement against the order the gradient of the graph is the wavelength λ divided by the slit width d. from fig 3 the gradient of the green line 0.148 ± 0.002 dimensionless the gradient of the red line 0.197 ± 0.003 dimensionless for each line the relationship between the gradient g and the wavelength follows the equation the width of each slit in the grating is 1/300 mm 3.33×10 −3 ± 1×10 −5 mm consequently the wavelength of the red light similarly the green light 's wavelength λ green is the uncertainty in each value of sin θ in terms of θ where θ is the angular displacement is given by σ where with σ θ being the angular width of each maximum in our measurements for each colour σ θ was approximately constant for the red light σ θ 4 arc minutes as measured by my lab partner and myself while for the green light σ θ 7 and 5 arc minutes with a mean value of 6 arc minutes this was all taken into account when computing the error on the gradient 2 arc minutes were also added in order to account for uncertainty in angle measurement on both edges of the image assuming the error in the slit width and the error on the angular width of each maximum are linearly independent then the error on the wavelength σ λ is therefore given in terms of the uncertainty in the gradient and in slit width σ g and σ d respectively through 2 rydberg constant calculation the wavelengths of the light rays observed correspond more closely to the balmer series than to any other series 5 therefore n f to equals 2 while n i is 3 for red and 4 for green in equation 3 for the rydberg constant for red light n i 3 and n f 2. the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h is given by 4 using equation 3 the weighted mean for r h is thus as discussed in the theoretical section to find the rydberg constant for heavy nuclei r ∞ we use equation 11 with m e being the electron mass and m p being the proton mass the ratio m p /m e is experimentally measured to be 1836.152470 76 11 thus our calculated value of r ∞ is with a range of therefore our value of the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom and the rydberg constant for heavy elements are indistinguishable due to the high uncertainty associated with each value the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant is 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 −10 m −1 which falls within our uncertainty range this means our measured value has a mean percentage error of 0.638 4 all uncertainty calculations are included in the appendix our measured range of values for the rydberg constant agrees experimentally with the currently accepted value as it falls within our range however a number of random and systematic errors that our uncertainty on the value are discussed below the rydberg constant is a function of the permittivity of free space as discussed in the theory section the permittivity of free space itself varies with pressure and humidity 13 therefore the permittivity of free space in our laboratory is different to the permittivity of free space in a vacuum upon which the accepted value of the rydberg constant is based the ratio of absolute permittivity of air to permittivity of a vacuum also known as relative permittivity is currently measured to be 1.00058986 ± 0.00000050 14 this means that r ∞ in air at standard pressure and temperature is 5 this value is still within our range of expected values of r ∞ however the mean percentage error is reduced from 0.638 to 0.547 another major source of systematic uncertainty is background light presence of background light would cause the width of the observed image to be smaller as the eye becomes less sensitive to light this would force us to use a larger slit width in order to increase brightness of image which would produce a less sharp image with larger uncertainty in position it also meant that we could obtain fewer data points as the image became much dimmer for maxima of order higher than 3 and less than -2. this assymetry in the data in itself suggests that background light from one direction was concealing the maxima at the order of -3. it also meant that we could not make any accurate measurements of the blue spectral lines with n f =5 one blue spectral was observed at an angle of about -8 degrees however the line was too dim to make any accurate measurements regarding its position or to find any other blue spectral lines theoretically the telescope has to be focused at infinity however we could only use a 5-metre-away object for focusing due to the dimensions and capacity of the laboratory room this meant that the telescope may have not been perfectly focused and a defocus aberration along the optical axis of the telescope might have occurred this would mean that the image is stretched out with a larger uncertainty in position while all care has been taken to ensure the alignment of the spectrometer as discussed in the method section small deviations from alignment would lead to light falling at a vertical angle to the telescopic lens from fig 1 the path of light would be shifted vertically i.e out of the paper in the figure this means light would travel a distance r 2 or r 1 plus some vertical distance k. the path difference δ thus becomes if k=0 this simply reduces to dsin θ for k not equal to zero the path difference approximation as dsin θ becomes less accurate if k or the vertical misalignment is comparable to the separation of the slit and the telescope the uncertainty due to this added approximate becomes significantly large our experiment is aimed at measuring the rydberg constant by analysing the balmer series for hydrogen using a diffraction grating spectrometer we measured the wavelengths of two of the spectral colours of the series the wavelength of the red colour was measured to be 660 ± 10 nm while the wavelength of the green colour was measured to be 490 ± 6nm these values were used to calculate a value for the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom which we found to be 1090 ± 10 × 10 4 m −1 we then used bohr 's atomic model formula for rydberg 's constant and found that the difference between the rydberg constant for hydrogen and that for heavy elements is smaller than we could detect due to the size of our uncertainties in measurements in angular displacement the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant is 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 −10 m −1 in a vacuum and 10960797 ± 11 m −1 in air thus implying a mean percentage error of 0.638 on our measurement compared to the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 compared to the rydberg constant in air we have also calculated the rydberg constant in air at standard temperature and pressure using values for rydberg constant and relative permittivity from literature 14 at 10960797 ±11m −1 both of these values fall within our range of uncertainty for the rydberg constant if the experiment is to be repeated the most significant improvement to be made is improved isolation from background light such as running the experiment in a dark room with no external lights or covering the collimator covering the collimator with a dark cloth would prevent external light from appearing with the image reduced background light would allow for the gathering of the blue spectral lines data this data could then be used to determine another value for the rydberg constant and hence improve the accuracy of the mean value it would also allow for the gathering of more data points for higher orders which would lead to reduced uncertainty due to random error another improvement would be the use of a diffraction grating with a wider slits as it would create more maxima per angular displacement and more data points can be gathered this would reduce the effect of random errors however it would also reduce the resolving power of the grating and thus introduce another uncertainty in the position of the maxima a grating with 150 slits per mm could thus be a better compromise between resolving power and number of data points over the 300 slits per mm grating we used using the same type of diffraction grating spectrometry analysing the spectral lines of various elements could be used to verify the relationship between r ∞ and the mass of the nuclei in order to verify bohr 's atomic model 's accuracy as stated in equation 8 the uncertainty on the wavelength is given by thus for red light the uncertainty is similarly the uncertainty in the green light 's wavelength is the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h as calculated using the red light 's wavelength is given by σ r where 2 the uncertainty on the weighted mean for the rydberg constant for hydrogen σ r h is given by the sum of the inverse of the errors squared which bohr 's model assumes that electrons rotate around the hydrogen nucleus in fixed quantised orbits the electrons do not radiate any energy less than the difference between the energy level they 're occupying and any other energy level as the electrons are rotating in almost circular orbits the centripetal force f centripetal is supplied by the coulomb attraction force and given by 12 where 0 is the permittivity of free space e is the charge of the electron or the proton and r is the radius of the orbit we then have where m e is the electron mass and v it 's velocity as the orbits are quantised the angular momentum l n of the n th orbit is therefore also quantised this means that for each orbit the angular momentum is an integral multiple of the reduced planck constant h. therefore we have where r n is the radius of the orbit and v n is the velocity of the electron in the orbit 12 solving equations 35 and 36 for r n and v n we get and we can now use these expressions to work out the total energye total the energy of the orbit is given in terms of kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p by 12 which is this reduces to as n is an integral value characterising each orbit if the electron starts at orbit with n n i and ends on orbit with n= n f the difference in energy is then given by ∆e where the rydberg constant is given by 2 let r ∞ air be the rydberg constant in air while r ∞ be the rydberg constant in a vacuum while air is the permittivity of free space in air while 0 is the permittivity of free space in a vacuum from equation 44 the ratio of the permittivity of free space in air to that in a vacuum is known as the relative permittivity r",deep,bal
15,GS_CCY232_Redacted,in this experiment we aimed to measure the value of the rydberg constant using a grating spectrometer we measured the emission spectra of hydrogen by measuring the angles of different order emission lines in the three most prominent colours by plotting the sine of the angle against the order to find the wavelengths of the colours and then using the rydberg formula we found the value of the rydberg constant to be 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f. this was fairly accurate but lacked precision the main source of uncertainty was the broadness of the spectral lines which caused a large uncertainty in the angles this may have also introduced systematic error into the values he aim of the experiment is to calculate the value of the rydberg constant using a grating spectrometer a grating spectrometer produces a collimated beam of light by passing a light from a source through a narrow slit and making it parallel using a collimating lens the beam of light then passes through a diffraction grating at normal incidence and this dispersed spectrum is focused and viewed with an eyepiece the diffraction grating can be considered as many thin slits that are equally spaced apart simplifying this to resemble young 's double slit experiment it can be seen that for light passing through the grating principal maxima occur when the phase difference between rays are integer multiples of 2π the difference between these experiments is that a diffraction grating allows more light to pass through and the maxima occur when they are all constructively interfering meaning the maxima are much brighter as seen in figure 2. the phase difference between neighbouring rays is given by the fraction of the wavelength displaced multiplied by 2π where 𝜆 is the wavelength of the light rays since the phase difference is an integer multiple m of 2π we can write the above equation as from the inset in figure 1 the path difference can be written as 𝑑 sin 𝜃 where d is the distance between neighbouring slits and 𝜃 is the angle moved through from the axis of the collimator therefore the equation becomes mλ 𝑑 sin 𝜃. to find the wavelength a graph of sin 𝜃 against m can be plotted and the value of the gradient will be λ the wavelength can be found by multiplying the gradient by the slit separation how the wavelength relates to the rydberg constant will be outlined in theory section ii transition wavelengths in hydrogen are given by the formula where n represents the initial energy state of the atom p represents the final energy state of the atom and 𝑅 ∞ is the rydberg constant for this experiment the balmer series will be used because it is in the visible part of the spectrum and can measuring the rydberg constant using a grating spectrometer t be observed using a spectrometer in this series p=2 which means that the will drop down from the n th to the second energy level and the difference in energy will give off a photon of a specific wavelength the value of n can be determined by looking at the measured values of the wavelength this is due to the planck-einstein relation which states that 𝐸 ℎ𝑓 or 𝐸 ℎ 𝑐 𝜆 where e is the difference in energy h is planck 's constant f is the frequency and c is the speed of light in a vacuum from this we can see that the difference in energy is inversely proportional to the wavelength and therefore the smallest difference in energy from n=3 to p=2 will correspond to the biggest wavelength using the measured values of the wavelength and the corresponding value of n the rydberg constant can be calculated using the rydberg formula the first step was to set up the spectrometer so it was properly aligned and focused this is imperative for accurate and precise measurements the eyepiece was focused so that an object around 5 metres away was focused on the cross wire the telescope camera lens and eyepiece were aligned with the axis of the collimator and a sodium lamp was switched on and positioned close behind the slit a sodium lamp was used for the set up because it can be switched on for longer than hydrogen and allows for all set-up measurements to be made the focus of the collimator was adjusted so that a sharp image of the slit was focused at the cross wire the reading of the vernier scales was taken so a `` 0° '' angle was noted as seen in table 1. the telescope was moved through 90° and a mirror was inserted in the diffraction grating holder the grating table was turned back until a reflected image of the slit in the mirror was seen through the eyepiece which meant that the grating surface was at 45° to the incident beam from the collimator this angle was noted the grating table was then moved again through precisely 45° so it was accurately set at a new `` 0° '' normal incidence this angle will be used as the zero point for all measurements the mirror was replaced with a diffraction grating and the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp finally the spectral lines were observed through the telescope to ensure the spectrometer was set up correctly two different diffraction gratings were used to observe the spectral lines in the preliminary measurements one was approximately 78.8 lines per mm and the other was 300 lines per mm it was seen that the different order lines were much more dispersed in the 300 lines per mm as seen in figure 4 and were of higher intensity meaning that individual spectral lines were much clearer and more distinct from other lines when using the 300 lines per mm grating this grating was kept in the holder and was used for the rest of the experiment another observation was that there were only three colours red aqua and blue that were clear enough to measure and that spectral lines with order greater than two were extremely difficult to measure therefore data was taken for these three colours with orders m=-2 to m=2 in addition the zero th order spectral lines were in the same position for each colour so one measurement was sufficient for all colours intermittently an array of unusual colours was seen through the eyepiece caused by desk lamps switching on and off around the room as a result the spectrometer was shielded from external light using black card and the hydrogen lamp was moved closer to the slit the centre of each spectral line for the three colours from m=-2 to m=2 was measured by each lab partner to reduce human error and to give a value for the statistical `` 0° '' angle 168° 44 `` 90° '' angle 78° 44 `` 45° '' angle 340° 58 new `` 0° '' angle 169° 04 e=hf e=hf uncertainty however a bigger source of was the width of the spectral lines because 𝜃 could lie anywhere within that width according to the bohr model spectral lines should not have thickness because the values for energy are discrete however due to various effects broadening of spectral lines occur effects such as natural broadening pressure broadening and opacity broadening can all increase the line thickness but the most considerable broadening in the visible spectrum is due to thermal doppler broadening 1 this is when hydrogen gas is hot so atoms move with different velocities and therefore have different frequencies due to the doppler shift this then results in a wider range of frequencies and broadens the spectral line the only way to reduce this would be to cool hydrogen gas to very low temperatures which is not possible for this experiment consequently the start and end of each spectral line was also measured and averaged to find the uncertainty of the angles a graph of sin 𝜃 against m was plotted for the three colours red aqua and blue the width of the spectral lines was measured to be 0.3° 1s.f so the uncertainty in the angles was ±0.2° 1s.f. the uncertainty in the gradients was calculated by plotting a graph of maximum gradient and minimum gradient for each colour and then calculating half of the difference between them this was carried through to the error in wavelength where the fractional errors of the gradient and the slit separation would have been added in quadrature however error in the slit separation if any would be extremely small as the slit separation is approximately 3 × 10 −6 so this error was deemed negligible therefore the fractional errors of the gradients were simply multiplied by the wavelengths to obtain the uncertainty in the wavelengths comparing these values to the known values as seen in figure 6 they are fairly accurate and within the range of the uncertainties this shows that the correct errors were accounted for this is further discussed in the latter parts of this section seeing as the wavelength for red is the largest and the wavelength for blue is the smallest it can be inferred from the planck-einstein relation that for red n=3 for aqua n=4 and for blue n=5 substituting this into the rydberg formula the following results were achieved table 3. results for the rydberg constant for red aqua and blue spectral lines and the calculated average rydberg constant the error in the rydberg constants for each colour was calculated using the derivative of the rydberg formula multiplied by the error of the wavelengths the following formula was used where 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ is the error in the rydberg constant and 𝜎 𝜆 is the error in the wavelengths the fractional errors of the rydberg constants for the three colours were then added in quadrature to obtain the error for the average rydberg constant therefore the final value for the rydberg constant is 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f. this differs from the known value of 10973731.6 m -1 which is approximately 100000 m -1 less than the value found in this experiment the known value is within the uncertainty meaning that the errors were accounted for the difference is most likely due to the wrong angles of the spectral lines being measured as only the midpoint of a range of angles was noted down however the gradient wavelength red 0.196±0.002 653±7nm aqua 0.145±0.002 482±7nm blue 0.129±0.002 430±7nm difference could also be due to human error when reading the angles off the vernier scales the angles could be interpreted differently by separate people because where the vernier scale aligns with the main scale can be difficult to see also the aqua blue colours at higher orders became very faint and were much harder to place at the crosswire which may have resulted in slightly erroneous measurements this result has a percentage error of 2.7 which is very high seeing the equipment used is extremely precise the value of this error comes from the measured value of the width of the spectral lines which was 0.3° this width could not be decreased as it was due to local conditions around the element which was uncontrollable with the available resources therefore this was the best precision possible to improve more advanced technology could be used to decrease the spectral line broadness and find more precise values for wavelengths and the rydberg constant the fact that all three values for the rydberg constant were higher than the known value suggests a systematic error this could have been due to several effects some more likely than others least likely would be spectrometer misalignment and defocus because the setup and preliminary checks were done carefully and rigorously however a calibration error may have been overlooked there may have been an error in the diffraction grating such as too little or too many lines however this is also unlikely as they are of professional quality the lamp position and background light did affect the experiment initially but solutions to these problems were quickly found the solutions may have been inadequate but the position of spectral lines would not have been affected by this greatly most likely was temperature air pressure and humidity which may have shifted frequencies and made them larger meaning the centre of the spectral lines measured may have given a smaller wavelength and therefore a larger rydberg constant overall the aim of the experiment was to calculate the value of the rydberg constant the method used involved measuring the angles of hydrogen spectral lines and calculating the wavelength by using path difference and phase difference formulae and plotting a graph from this the rydberg constant was calculated using the rydberg formula and the constant was found to be 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f. this value is accurate but not very precise when compared to the known value of 10973731.6 m -1 the lack of precision was caused by the broadness of the spectral lines which increased the uncertainty and may have caused systematic error to improve more considerations can be taken to reduce the thickness of the spectral lines and better evaluation of potential systematic error can be made overall the experiment calculated the rydberg constant accurately because the known value was within the range of the measured value and successfully demonstrated many aspects of spectroscopy,expert,bal
16,GS_JSR480_Redacted,"the rydberg constant rh is measured using a grating spectrometer to determine the wavelength of different colours on the hydrogen emission spectrum these colours are used with the transition in energy levels they correspond to in order to calculate a value for rh in this experiment rh was calculated as 1.07±0.04 ×10 7 m −1 this puts the accepted value 1.10 × 10 7 m −1 within range of the experimental uncertainties an accurate result o n falling from a higher to a lower energy level of the atom an electron emits a photon the characteristic wavelength and hence colour of the emitted photon is dependent only on this change in energy level the coefficient that describes this relationship is the rydberg constant r h as in the rydberg equation n 2 n 1 1 2 3 ... where λ represents wavelength of the emitted photon r h the rydberg constant and n 1 n 2 the initial and final states respectively of a 'falling electron 1 the analysis of spectra is fundamental to many physical disciplines making r h a key constant this is demonstrated in astrophysics planetary nebulae are a type of emission nebulae their spectra show strong emission features analysis of the doppler shift of the spectra lines can be used to determine how fast gas ejected from the nebulae is expanding 2 to find expansion speed a stationary laboratory reference is required the techniques for studying the spectrum of the reference gas are similar to those used in this experiment the study of emission spectra is greatly simplified with hydrogenic nuclei hydrogen consisting of only one proton and one electron analysing this most simple emission spectrum with an instrument capable of high precision the grating spectrometer allows very accurate empirical determination the wavelength of each coloured fringe is found from the following equation where d represents the slit separation m the order of a fringe and θ m the position of fringe m 1 the position of a fringe refers to the angle of the centre of the fringe of a particular colour from a defined zero reference position the value r h referred to in this experiment is the value that is spectroscopically determined this is not in exact agreement with r ∞ the theoretically determined value in the theoretical determination of r ∞ the nucleus was treated as infinitely massive and therefore stationary with the electron rotating around it the correcting equation for hydrogen is where m e and m p are the masses of an electron and a proton respectively the theoretical and experimental values are however in very close agreement this is because the ratio me mp is 1 1836 so the adjustment in equation 3 is very small a factor of 1836 1837 3 this adjustment is far smaller than the experimental uncertainty discussed later meaning it can be neglected and r h and r ∞ can be treated as equivalent using equation 1 with n 2 =2 a more specific equation results n 3 4 5 ... describing electron transitions in the visible section of the em spectrum the balmer series with a decrease in energy level from n 2 to 2 4 this equation was empirically discovered by johann balmer prior to its generalisation equation 1 by johannes rydberg 1 fig 1 emission spectra corresponding to balmer series with excited electrons emitting a photon of the shown colour on decrease in energy levels from n 2 to n =2 5 as it is known which colour of the spectrum corresponds to which transition it is possible to find a value for r h from each colour and its wavelength for this report 'blue will refer to transition 4 → 2 and 'dark blue/purple will refer to transition 5 → 2 as shown in figure 1. light from a lamp was aimed through a single slit before being collimated through a lens/collimator the light was then dispersed through the grating before being refocused through the camera to the eyepiece the eyepiece could then be rotated to observe the positions of different fringes the angle through which the light was bent and thus the position of each fringe depended on the width of the slit in the grating related in equation 2. for the repeatability of results and proper calibration the following apparatus set-up procedure was followed the eyepiece and the crosshair were aligned and focused on an object around 5m away to eliminate parallax between the image and crosshair the telescope composed of the camera lens and eyepiece was angled so that it was parallel with the collimator the collimator focus was then altered to give an image of maximum clarity the telescope was then rotated through exactly 90° as measured on the angular scale the grating was placed in its holder on the turntable of the spectrometer and adjusted so that the collimated light passed through it the grating used was 78.8 lines per mm the turntable was then rotated until a reflected image of the entrance slit was directly behind the crosshair giving an angle of exactly 45° which was recorded before the turntable was rotated through exactly 45° thus set to 0° rotating in either direction from this zero reference allow angular positions of fringes to be determined with rotations in opposite directions having opposite sign defining one direction as positive meant readings could taken both sides of zero giving more data with which to plot a graph thus reducing uncertainty in the gradient of each graph the fringe number and colour with its associated angular displacement was recorded in degrees and arc minutes for each fringe these values were then converted to radians before a graph of sin θ m against m was plotted for each colour giving gradient as λ d as d represents the distance between slits which is the inverse of line density of the grating the wavelength of the fringes could be calculated using equation 4 r h can then be found from equation 2 it is clear that a graph of sin θ m against fringe order m should show a linear relationship both red and blue plots showed this after plotting the blue results figure 4 it was noticed that all points had a similar gradient but there was a step in values between the m=0 and m=1 fringes this implied incorrect labelling of fringe numbers by changing points m=1,2 to points m=2,3 respectively the far more concordant graph was plotted shown in figure 5. the difference became even more apparent on plotting the residuals of the original and corrected plots as in figure 6. the variance of the corrected residuals is 7 times smaller than that of the uncorrected plot 2.81×10 −5 vs 1.97×10 −4 strongly improving quality of the line of best fit and the final result fig 6 residuals for both blue plots calculated by subtracting y coordinate of each point from the position of the line of best fit at that same point from the gradients of these figures the wavelength of red fringes was calculated as 661 ± 8 nm consistent with table i and the blue wavelength was calculated as 510 ± 20 nm meaning the accepted value is narrowly outside the range of experimental uncertainty the value of r h was determined as 1.09±0.01 ×10 7 m −1 using the calculated red wavelength and 1.05 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 using the calculated blue wavelength giving a final value of 1.07 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 meaning the accepted value of 1.10×10 7 m −1 1 is within range of the experimental errors of the calculated result a major shortcoming of this study was an insufficient number of results for dark blue/purple fringes allowing only two values for r h to be found this difficulty is probably due to the closeness of first order fringes simply masking/blurring the position of individual fringes this means that there was so much overlap between fringes it was hard to identify where one fringe ends and another began a way to reduce this effect in the future would be to use a grating with a greater line density reducing slit separation d. from equation 2 it is seen that would increase the value of sin θ m for each given fringe which for an angle 90°would also be an increase in θ m with each colour spread out by a different angle due to different wavelengths this would mean less fringe overlap and better fringe identification a large assumption in the results was the allocation of errors the manufacturer-stated uncertainty of the grating spectrometer is impressively small as little as three parts in ten thousand 8 the uncertainty in the fringe position was in fact much greater than this as the position of the centre of a given fringe was subject to the judgement of the equipment operator this is because the fringe is not a precisely located extremely small line but a bright section of differing intensity thus error associated with fringe angle was far greater than the minimum uncertainty of the spectrometer for the purpose of error bars on our results a modest estimate was used this was found by measuring the width of a large fringe as the centre must be contained within the full width of the fringe a large fringe was chosen as using a smaller fringe could have been an underestimate for larger fringes whereas using a large fringe gives an overestimate for smaller fringes it was more responsible to use the overestimate this was quoted as the error for every fringe ±0.6° giving ±0.01 for uncertainty in sin θ m although this is n't an accurate way of assigning uncertainties time constraints did not allow us to take a reading for every fringe thus more advanced error analyses were not available to us it was also large enough to encompass aforementioned errors such as that associated with the spectrometer itself and the discrepancy between r h and r ∞ a more suitable way of assigning errors in the future would involve taking two values for each fringe the smallest and greatest angle at which the fringe can be seen the mean of which gives the value to be recorded this gives a more appropriate value for each fringe and particularly for smaller fringes should reduce uncertainties giving a more accurate determination of r h it is worth mentioning that the value for r h as calculated using only the red fringes is both more accurate and precise than the final value averaging both the blue and red value with errors combined in quadrature this shows how remarkably less accurate the blue fringes were than the reds this may due to an observational error in results confusion of colours as shown in figure 1 the purple/dark blue and light blue fringe appear much more similar than either do with the red consequently it may be true that one or more of the 'blue points in figure 5 belong on a different graph in the future clearly identifying colours at the start of the experiment could reduce uncertainty in the result by providing a whole extra set of purple/dark blue data and reduce variance from line of best fit in blue results this could be done by calculating the theoretical angle at which a fringe of each colour would be seen using data in table i with equation 2. the telescope could then be adjusted to this position and the colour at/nearest this point identified as that colour from table i for future readings all these improvements rely on more time for completion of the experiment as set-up of the equipment took up a large portion of the available time improving the efficiency of setting up the equipment would allow more readings to be taken increasing accuracy in determined value of r h the aim of the experiment was to find an accurate value for the rydberg constant by analysis of the hydrogen emission spectrum using a grating spectrometer upon calculation of the wavelength of two different sets of coloured fringes and comparison to the balmer series two values for r h were found using the balmer equation varying degrees of accuracy and approximately determined errors limited reliability however the final result was both accurate and precise with the accepted value 1.10 × 10 7 m −1 within the range of uncertainty of the empirical value 1.07 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 in the case of this experiment being repeated a few simple improvements described in this report should be implemented including a better description of uncertainties and proper identification of colours these changes could improve the accuracy of the results",extended,bal
17,GS_FHJ539_Redacted,"he hydrogen spectral series is very important especially in the field of astronomical spectroscopy as it allows for the detection of hydrogen gas which makes up most of the universe 1 the emission and absorption of photons as electrons move between energy states gives rise to the spectral series the balmer series corresponds to electrons transitions happening from higher energy levels down to the second quantum level the transition wavelengths of the balmer series are in the visible spectrum 2 the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ is a fundamental constant in the rydberg formula which is a mathematical formula used to predict the transitional wavelength of an atom 3 the rydberg formula is important in the development of quantum mechanics 𝑅 ∞ is important because it is an auxiliary constant which can be represented as a product of other fundamental constants 4 a spectrometer is an instrument used to study the emission and absorption of light by different atomic nuclei it uses a prism or diffraction grating to disperse a beam of light into a line spectrum 1 the different colours of light are diffracted at different angles on either side of the zero maximum order which is the position in the centre where all the colours of light are in a parallel beam each line corresponds to a separate energy level spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique and is used in the study of plasmas stars flames and semiconductors 2 the uncertainty in the final value of 𝑅 ∞ in this experiment includes the correction for the errors present in the experiment using approximation this includes the corrections for spectrometer misalignment the lamp position grating period background light and fringe width the hydrogen atom emits four lines alpha beta gamma and delta in the visible region of the spectrum in 1885 balmer developed a mathematical relationship called the balmer series to represent the wavelength of these lines where r is the rydberg constant and n is an integer 6 in 1889 a more general formula the rydberg formula which could describe any of hydrogen 's emission spectrums was introduced by johann rydberg where 𝑅 ∞ is the rydberg constant and n and p are the principle quantum numbers and can be represented by any integer 6 p 2 corresponds to the balmer series for a hydrogen atom in 1916 niels bohr introduced the atomic hydrogen model in this model he postulated that an electron is held in a stable circular orbit around the nucleus by an electric force 𝐹 𝐸 given by coulomb 's law where e is the magnitude of the charge of an electron 𝑟 𝑛 is the radius of the orbit at the nth quantum state and ɛ 0 is the permittivity of space 7 𝐹 𝐸 supplies the centripetal force 𝐹 𝐶 needed to keep the electron in orbit therefore by newton 's 2 nd law equation 3 can be written as where 𝑚 𝑒 is electron mass and 𝑣 𝑛 is the speed of revolution of the electron when it has a radius of revolution 𝑟 𝑛 bohr postulated that the angular momentum of the orbiting electron l needed to be quantised in units of h/2π giving l= 𝑚 𝑒 𝑣 𝑛 𝑟 𝑛 𝑛 h 2𝜋 where n=1,2,3… 5 where h is planck 's constant solving equations 4 and 5 gives 𝑟 𝑛 and 𝑣 𝑛 as the blackett laboratory

radius occurs when n 1. the total energy of an electron 𝐸 𝑛 at the nth quantum state can be represented by the sum of the kinetic energy due to the motion of the orbiting electron and the electric

electron transitions which can be described using 𝐸 𝑃ℎ𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑛 𝐸 𝑖 − 𝐸 𝑓 ℎ c 𝜆 10 where 𝐸 𝑖 and 𝐸 𝑓 are the initial and final energy levels respectively and c is the speed of light in a vacuum the wavelength of the photon emitted can then be calculated using equations 9 and 10 which is similar to equation 2 where 𝑛 𝑖 n and 𝑛 𝑓 p respectively the bohr model of hydrogen was important in the development of quantum mechanics 1 and is accurate in predicting the spectra of hydrogen however it can not be used to make predictions of the spectra of more complex atoms the model violates heisenberg 's uncertainty principle as it describes electrons as tiny particles with a definite trajectory and radius other limitations include being unable to predict the relative intensities of the spectral line and explain the zeeman effect 8 in this experiment 𝑅 ∞ was calculated using equation 2 by measuring the wavelength of the balmer series of hydrogen the measurements of the transition wavelengths of the balmer series of hydrogen were made using a pasco student spectrometer the setup of the apparatus is shown in figure 1. there are three main components of the spectrometer the collimator the diffraction grating and the telescope figure 2 is a schematic diagram which illustrates the working principles of the spectrometer light from the hydrogen lamp enters the collimator through the narrow collimator slit which is located at the focal point of the collimator lens the light is focused into a narrow parallel beam allowing it to strike the diffraction grating at normal incidence a grating is a large number n of equally spaced slits which have a slit separation d. the diffraction grating works by diffracting light equally on both sides of the normal at an angle 𝜃. constructive interference occurs when the path difference between neighbouring rays is an integer multiple m of the wavelength λ. therefore the path difference can be written as where m is called the order of diffraction equation 13 is known as the grating equation different colours of light are diffracted at different angles when the telescope is focused at infinity parallel light rays of a specific colour will enter the telescope and form an image of a slit at the crosshair which is the focal point of the objective lens of the telescope 1 9 a magnified image is viewed using the eyepiece 2 the arm of the telescope can be rotated to view the various slits of different colours the diffraction angle can be measured using the vernier scale the experimental apparatus was set up carefully to ensure the collimator diffraction grating and telescope were in a straight line to get accurate results and to reduce the uncertainty due to the misalignment of the spectrometer a sodium vapour lamp was used to set up the apparatus the eyepiece was focused on the crosswire and the telescope was placed parallel to the axis of the collimator the sodium lamp was placed close to the collimator slit and the telescope was adjusted until the image of the lamp could be seen clearly the angle was read off the vernier scale and this position was set as the origin the telescope arm was then rotated by 90 degrees the grating was rotated and adjusted until a sharp image of the reflected light could be seen through the telescope which meant that the grating was at 45 degrees to the telescope the grating was then rotated 45 degrees so that it was parallel to the collimator and the camera was rotated 90 degrees back to the origin the diffraction grating was placed on the grating table a 78.8 lines per mm diffraction grating was used in this experiment 2 preliminary data was taken by adjusting the size of the collimator slit to get a balance between the intensity of the fringes the width of the fringes and the number of orders which could be seen the collimator slit size was made quite large to increase the number of diffraction orders which could be seen this resulted in the fringes having a large width size the hydrogen lamp was switched on and the crosshair was centred at the middle of the white slit which was taken as the zeroth order the angle of this position was read off the vernier scale and recorded as ɵ zero the telescope arm was rotated on either side find a bright fringe the fringes on the right side of the zeroth order were determined to be the positive orders and the fringes on the left side were the negative orders as shown in figure 3. the crosshair was aligned at the centre of fringes and the angle corresponding to the position of the fringe ɵ m was recorded where m is the order of the fringe the value of 𝜃 was calculated using the equation figure 3. the vernier scale has an uncertainty of ±0.005 degrees measurements of ɵ m were taken thrice the average value and the standard error of the mean for ɵ m were calculated the telescope arm was rotated so that the crosshair was aligned on either edge of the fringe and the difference between the angles read off the vernier scale divided by two was taken as the uncertainty due to the width of the fringe this was repeated for all the orders including the zeroth order the standard error of the mean for ɵ m and the uncertainty due to the fringe width were compared and the bigger uncertainty was taken as the uncertainty of ɵ m the spectrometer was misaligned by 2 degrees and a few measurements of the position of the first order were taken this was done to estimate the uncertainty in 𝜃 caused by the misalignment of the spectrometer the hydrogen lamp was moved further away from the collimator lens and the position of the positive first-order was measured the difference between this value measured and ɵ m where m 1 was taken as an approximation of the uncertainty in 𝜃 due to the lamp position the experiment was done in a dark room to reduce the uncertainty due to background light the three lines which were visible balmer alpha beta and gamma were seen as the colours red blue and violet respectively measurements of up to five positive and negative orders were taken for the red and blue spectral lines of the balmer series of hydrogen however the intensity of the purple fringes were not strong enough and only 2 negative orders and 4 positive orders could be seen only three of the four balmer lines of hydrogen were visible these were balmer alpha balmer beta and balmer gamma with the wavelengths 649 ± 14 nm 486 ± 3 nm and 433 ± 3 nm respectively the fourth line was very dim and no appropriate measurements of it could be taken the value of the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ was calculated to be 1.09 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m -1 the lines on the 78.8 lines per mm diffraction grating were not exactly symmetrical leading to some of the fringes being distorted and misaligned therefore an approximate value of d with an uncertainty was calculated from another experiment done to calculate the fraunhofer lines the angles of the na fraunhofer line was obtained using the same spectrometer and diffraction grating the value of d was then calculated using equation 13 by plotting a graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against m and using the gradient to find the value of d by multiplying the gradient with the value of λ which was taken as 589.3nm the experimental estimate of the value of d along with its uncertainty was used for the calculations in this experiment so that a more accurate value of the transition wavelengths of the balmer series and 𝑅 ∞ could be calculated the value of d for the 78.8 lines per mm diffraction grating which was calculated using the grating equation was found to be 1.27 ± 0.02 × 10 -5 m. graphs of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against diffraction orders m were plotted to calculate the transition wavelengths of the balmer series of hydrogen these are shown in figure 4. the gradients of the graphs for the plots of the red blue and violet spectral lines and their respective wavelengths are shown in table 1. the wavelengths of the balmer lines were calculated using equation 13 by multiplying the gradient with d. the value of d used is 1.27 ± 0.02 × 10 -5 m. 1. the values of the gradients of the graph the wavelengths and their respective uncertainties the transition wavelengths of the balmer series found were compared to the accepted values which are 656.28 nm 486.13 nm and 434.05 nm respectively 10 the accepted values lie within the range of values found the values of λ obtained for the balmer series are very accurate as they lie within one standard deviation of the accepted value the positive order fringes had stronger intensities which resulted in the positive angles having a lower uncertainty and higher weighting in the calculation of λ for the balmer lines the number of negative and positive orders taken for each visible balmer line was five however some orders were not visible such as m= -5 for red very few orders were visible for balmer gamma which was seen as a violet colour many of the violet fringes were dim and the positions could not be determined accurately therefore the positions of the fringes were taken as approximations which resulted in a high uncertainty for the value of 𝜃. only two negative order fringes were visible for balmer gamma however the number of positive order slits which could be seen were up to m 5. the size of the collimator slit was made to be quite large to increase the intensity of the fringes visible so they could be seen clearly and to allow measurements of up to five positive and negative orders to be taken however this resulted in a large fringe width the fringes could no longer be approximated as slits due to the large fringe width and the position of the centre of the slit had to be approximated the light from the other experiments which were being conducted in the room might have also affected the value of 𝜃 calculated the uncertainty due to this was estimated and written as the uncertainty due to background light the sum of the uncertainties due to the fringe width background light spectrometer misalignment and lamp position was used as the total uncertainty for the values of 𝜃. the uncertainty of the vernier scale was not included as it was very small and was considered to be negligible the value of 𝑅 ∞ was calculated by plotting where 𝑝 2. the negative gradient is the value of 𝑅 ∞ the gradient of the plot in figure 5 is -1.085 ± 0.041 × 10 7 m -1 the value of 𝑅 ∞ which is the negative gradient was found to be 1.09 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m -1 accurate to 3 s.f the errors present in the experiment are listed in table 2. table 2 shows how each individual error affects the value of 𝑅 ∞ calculated the fringe width caused the highest uncertainty in the calculation of the wavelength of the balmer lines of hydrogen and 𝑅 ∞ therefore for future experiments the hydrogen lamp should be allowed to cool for longer periods of time between measurements so that the intensity of the visible fringes increases and the positions of the fringes can be taken more accurately a stronger intensity hydrogen lamp should also be used so that the collimator slit size can be reduced and therefore the uncertainty due to the fringe width the experiment should also be conducted in a completely dark room to reduce the uncertainty due to the background light another suggestion for a more accurate measurement of 𝑅 ∞ would be to use a computer-aided diffraction grating spectrometer 1 the aims of the experiment were to measure the hydrogen balmer series and to calculate the value of the rydberg constant r∞ using a diffraction grating spectrometer three lines of the balmer series balmer alpha beta and gamma were observed however the fourth line which has a wavelength of 410 nm could not be seen 𝑅 ∞ was calculated by measuring the transition wavelengths of the hydrogen atomic spectrum by using the grating equation the value of 𝑅 ∞ was found to be 1.09 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m -1 accurate to 3 significant figures the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ which is 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 lies within the range of values the experiment was accurate in measuring the value of 𝑅 ∞ as the value found in the experiment lies within one standard deviation of the accepted value the experiment was quite precise having a total uncertainty of 3.7 even though the total value included corrections for the systematic errors present these systematic errors included the spectrometer misalignment the lamp position grating period fringe width and background light",superficial,bal
18,GS_PAO564_Redacted,"a hydrogen lamp is used to determine the rydberg constant which is has a commonly accepted value of 1.09678x10 7 m -1 .this is done using a grating spectrometer where the diffraction grating which was used had 78.8 lines per millimetre the calibration of the spectrometer was done using a sodium lamp but a hydrogen lamp is used when collecting data i calculated the rydberg constant to be 9.846x10 6 ± 5.14x10 -2 m -1 when an excited electron in an atom transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level the change in energy is emitted as a photon of specific wavelength which is given by e=hf 1 where h is planck 's constant f is the frequency of the photon and e is the energy of the photon a diffraction grating diffracts light when it passes through and the relationship between the wavelength λ distance between the slits d and the angle of diffraction θ is given by dsinθ=nλ when electrons in hydrogen transition they wavelength is given by where -r ꚙ is the rydberg constant and n and p are the initial and final energy levels respectively 1 when a hydrogen lamp is used three colours were visible -red purple and blue and these represent transitions from n=3,4,5 to p=2 1 measurements of multiple orders were taken on both sides of the zero order and this was used to find a wavelength for each colour using equation 2 before taking any measurements using the grating spectrometer it first had to be aligned and focused this was done using a sodium lamp when a lamp was required we first ensured that there was no parallax between the image and cross hairs by focusing the eyepiece and camera lens then the telescope was aligned to the normal by first finding the reflected image of the entrance slit after placing the diffraction in the holder then the telescope was moved by 45 degrees and the angle was noted as this is normal incidence and where the zero order should be finally the height of the image is adjusted using the grating screws to ensure the image is at the right height for measurements and is not tilted which would affect the reading the setup can be seen in figure 1 below figure 1 the figure above shows the basic setup of the grating spectrometer where light comes in from the source to the left the hydrogen lamp in this experiment the light passes through the collimator and then through the diffraction grating where it diffracts and the spectral lines can be seen through the telescope rotating the telescope clockwise shows the negative order spectral lines and the positive order lines can be seen by rotating the telescope anti-clockwise collimator telescope positive orders after noting down the zero order angle the hydrogen lamp is used to obtain the first set of readings we decided that readings on both sides of the zero order would be taken to reduce the uncertainty in the experiment one set of positive and negative order measurements for one colour would be taken by me and then the lamp would be allowed to cool the second set of readings for the same colour would be taken by my partner after the lamp was considered cool enough for use this process was used to obtain measurements for all three colours this ensured that any systematic errors or bias when reading the scale due to a single person reading the scale would not carry over in the analysis of the results and into the final conclusion if the hydrogen lamp is switched on for long periods of time it produced very blurry lines to prevent this from affecting measurements the lamp was switched off periodically and allowed to cool when taking measurements of the different colours and their respective orders the centre of these bands was difficult to determine and can easily produce large uncertainties this meant that our method of determining the angle had to be changed and so we chose to select the edge of the band closest to zero order and use this as our reference point for each colour and order the angle that was collected in the measurements for each order and colour is then subtracted from the zero order angle for each respective measurement and this angle is θ for each different order which is then substituted into equation 2 where d is 1/78800 the diffraction grating has 78.8 lines per mm so d is 1/lines per m this results in multiple wavelengths for each colour red purple and blue so the average is taken for each colour and this is the wavelength used to produce the final graph using equation 3 a graph of 1/wavelength is plotted against 1/n 2 -1/p 2 and this is shown in figure 2. the graph has a gradient of -9.846x10 6 ± 5.14x10 -2 and the intercept is 1.513x10 5 ± 1.583x10 -7 from this we can deduce the rydberg constant r ꚙ to be 9.846x10 6 m -1 this is different from the commonly accepted value of 1.09678x10 7 m -1 and it could be due to multiple reasons one reason could be that the measurements of the angle was not perfect and that there were inaccurate readings due to human error another possible cause could be the wrong alignment and focus of the grating spectrometer which could result in readings that are far from accurate a final cause for the discrepancy could be that due to the slightly blurred lines in the purple spectral lines the edge was not as definitive as it was for the other colours and this could likely affect our readings and the errors could propagate when calculating the line of best fit the aim of this experiment was to find the rydberg constant using a hydrogen lamp this was done by allowing the light from the hydrogen lamp to pass through a grating spectrometer and the spectral lines were observed and the figure 2 the above graph shows the correlation between wavelength and energy level transitions the gradient of this graph represents the rydberg constant which is found to be -9.846x10 6 ± 5.14x10 -2 and the intercept is 1.513x10 5 ± 1.583x10 -7 angles measured so that a graph can be drawn and this can enable us to calculate the rydberg constant this experiment had many errors which were not accounted for or prevented which produced some rather inaccurate results however our results calculated the rydberg constant to be 9.846x10 6 m -1",superficial,the
19,GS_JWW382_Redacted,"this lab report goes through the processes and findings of an experiment carried out to calculate the rydberg constant r∞ using a grating spectrometer our results give a value of 1.089×10 7 ±82490m −1 thus the true value 10,973,731.6 m −1 falls just outside the estimated margin of error the experimental process involves setting up a grating spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp in order to determine the wavelengths of hydrogen 's emission spectrum in this experiment wavelength values for the red and blue spectral lines were calculated each of these values was then combined with the knowledge of the balmer series and used in rydberg 's equation to get two separate values for r∞ one for each colour these values are then averaged to give the final value for r∞ t he rydberg constant r ∞ is a constant that appears in rydberg 's equation which predicts the wavelength of spectral light as a result of electrons moving between energy levels in an atom when an element 's gaseous state is heated atoms will absorb energy resulting in electrons being excited and moving from lower energy states to higher ones when these electron de-excite back down to lower energy level they release photons of specific energies corresponding to the atom 's energy levels because of this each element has a distinct spectral fingerprint this discovery formed the basis of the study of spectroscopy this lab report describes an experiment which uses a diffraction grating spectrometer to measure r ∞ the experiment first involves carefully setting up the collimator grating and eyepiece so that the slit image is focused precisely at the cross wire inside the telescope once this is done the eyepiece is turned through various angles to look for spectral lines the angles at which the spectral lines occur are measured using a vernier scale built into the spectrometer table the angle and the order associated with each of the coloured lines is then recorded and compiled to produce a dataset which can be graphed in python as sin θ vs. order m for each colour the gradient of each graph is equal to λ d where d is the slit separation of the grating thus the value of λ can be obtained by multiplying the value of the gradient by d. this value for λ is then substituted into rydberg 's equation to calculate r ∞ for that colour these values of r ∞ can then be averaged to obtain a final value for r ∞ the rydberg constant as mentioned in section i appears in rydberg 's equation which relates the wavelengths of spectral lines λ to the integer energy levels of the initial and final energy state of the atom n and p respectively r ∞ is calculated by working out the wavelengths of hydrogen 's emission spectrum and substituting the values into rydberg 's equation to understand how the emission spectrum for hydrogen is produced we must consider an important piece of apparatus for the experimentthe hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp is essentially a long tube with two electrodes on each end filled with hydrogen gas when a large potential difference is applied between the two electrodes electrons from the circuit are accelerated through the gas from one electrode to the other as the electrons flow through the tube some of them may collide with atomic electrons in the hydrogen gas 1 to understand the physics of what happens at this stage we can use the bohr model of the atom in the bohr model electrons travel in circular orbits around the nucleus the energy of these orbits is proportional to the electron 's distance from the nucleus -the further the electron the higher the energy most importantly the model states that the only stable orbits allowed for the electrons are those in which the electron 's angular momentum is an integer multiple h. thus electrons can only orbit at discrete distances from the nucleus -orbits are quantized these quantized orbits are more commonly known as energy levels and they are specific to each element 2 fig 1. the bohr model of the hydrogen atom showing the electron tranisions representing the lymer blamer and paschen series now when an accelerated circuit electron with enough energy collides with the atomic electrons in the energy levels the atomic electron will absorb energy equal to that of the energy difference between two energy levels this will excite the electron to that higher energy level the excited electron will then de-excite back down to a lower energy level and in the process emit a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels here is the key point -as each element has specific energy levels only certain wavelengths of light can be produced for each element more specifically only light of wavelength hc e where e is the energy difference between the two energy levels will be emitted from the lamp these specific frequencies of light make up the emission spectrum for the element in the case of the hydrogen lamp the light emitted from the lamp is only composed of frequencies corresponding to hydrogen 's emission spectrum however one of the key parts of the experiment involves actually working out what the wavelengths of hydrogen 's emission spectrum are in order to do this we need to use another key bit of apparatus -a diffraction grating using this we need to find a formula which relates the wavelengths of the lines to other features of the apparatus such as the angle through which the telescope is turned this equation can be derived in the following manner a diffraction grating can be thought of as a large number n of equally spaced narrow slits with slit separation d. for light of wavelength λ a principal maximum occurs when the phase difference between the two rays are an integer multiple m of 2π from fig 1. we can see that the path difference between two light rays is d sin θ thus where m is known as the order number thus if we gain a set in 1885 swiss physicist johann balmer deduced by trial and error that the wavelengths of light spectra emitted by hydrogen atoms followed the relationship where r was a constant which is now known as the rydberg constant r ∞ 3 however balmer suggested that this relationship could be generalised and it took swedish physicist johannes rydberg in 1889 to find the general formula now known as rydberg 's formula where n p for the hydrogen atom p 2 corresponds to the balmer series other series have also been calculated such as the ultraviolet lyman series for p 1 and the infrared paschen series for p 3 however these are less important for this experiment as none of these series produce visible emission lines for the balmer hydrogen series there are 4 main emission lines the red line h α corresponds to n 3 the turquoise/green line h β corresponds to n 4 the blue line h γ corresponds to n 5 and the purple/indigo line h δ corresponds to n 6 4 fig 3. the line spectra for hydrogen depending on which coloured lines are seen the appropriate value of n and p 2 should be used in rydberg 's equation this can then be combined with corresponding value of λ to calculate r ∞ the setup for this experiment was imperative to its overall success and accuracy so we a took a lot of time to make sure the apparatus was prepared correctly fig 4. shows the set up used for this experiment first we needed to focus the telescope eyepiece and camera lens the telescope was turned such that it pointed at a pencil case roughly 5-10 metres away with an unobstructed view without the diffraction grating in place on the table the focusing was done in two stages first the eyepiece was focused on the cross wire which is a `` × '' located inside the telescope by sliding the eyepiece in and out until the cross wire was as dark and sharp as possible next the actual camera lens was focused this involved adjusting the focus knob on the side of the telescope until the distant pencil case was in sharp focus however just doing this will not achieve the correct focus because parallax has n't been considered the way we eliminated parallax was by making use of the cross wire we looked through the telescope so we could see both the focused images of the cross wire and the other spectrometer by moving our head left and right we saw that the cross wire and the spectrometer moved back and forth in sync i.e one did n't move faster than the other this told us that the whole telescope was fully focused and that there was no parallax between the image and the cross wire now that the telescope was fully focused the focus knob on the telescope was not moved for the remainder of the experiment after this we needed to focus the collimator first the telescope was roughly aligned with the collimator at this point in a usual spectrometry experiment the lights would be turned off an the focus would be tested using a hydrogen lamp source however the manufacturers of the lamp recommend that the hydrogen lamp should be switched of every 30 second to prevent the lamp overheating seeing as the focusing of the collimator takes considerably longer than 30 seconds just for this part of the experiment a sodium lamp was used in its place the advantage of using a sodium lamp is that it could be kept switched on all the time the lamp was placed close behind the collimator and without changing the focus on the camera lens the focus knob on the collimator was adjusted until a sharp image of the slit was focused at the cross wire as with the previous part the next part of the setup involved aligning the diffraction grating with the collimator such that the grating was normal to the collimator first we used the previous setup in which the telescope and collimator were aligned and the telescope was focused on the sodium lamp we then locked the spectrometer table so the table ca n't move and took an angle reading using the verier angle scale due to the fact that the vernier scale on the spectrometer is very small we used a magnifying glass to read all our measurements this particular magnifying glass used had a bonus feature of doubling as a torch which made it possible to see the scale in the dark the measurement taken was 221 • 38 next we subtracted 90 • from this value and moved the telescope to that exact value of 131 • 38 then we locked the telescope in place and unlocked the table so that the grating was free to rotate independently of the telescope and collimator afterwards the table was turned until the slit image was seen through the telescope which indicated that the grating was roughly at 45 • to both the telescope and collimator to get the image exactly focused on the cross wire we made use of the slow motion drive a knob that moves the table very slowly and precisely to make very small adjustments so that the image fell exactly on the cross wire once this was achieved we took a reading at this point of 80 • and added the 45 • back that that the grating was at an angle of 125 • now that grating was normal to the collimator the table was locked and not changed for the remainder of the experiment the sodium lamp was then replaced with the hydrogen lamp and the remainder of the experiment could begin we started by trying to identify colours we saw in the emission spectrum having already studied the emission spectrum for hydrogen we knew that there were 4 possible colours red turquoise blue and purple for this experiment the most visible and abundant colours were red and blue we in fact did n't see any turquoise or purple lines at all to start with we focused the cross wire on the central maximum or 0th order line which was measured to be at 125 • then starting with the red emission lines we turned the telescope to the right until our cross wire focused on it 's first red line using the vernier scale we then recorded the angle measurement using the magnifying glass for that line and named it the 1st order maximum m=1 the angle measurement data was then added to a table of order m and angle on the vernier scale θ next we continued to move the telescope to the right until we saw the next red line m 2 and again took the angle reading and added it to the table we continued this process by turning the telescope to the right until we could see no more we then turned the telescope back to the central maximum and repeated this process for by moving the telescope to the left in this case we simply called the first line we saw m -1 and the second line m -2 and so on with negative integers this process was then repeated for the blue lines and a set of data was obtained relating the scale reading on the vernier scale to the order of the maximum for both the red and blue spectrum lines in order to work out lambda for both the red and blue lines we needed to make two graphs of sinθ vs m. however the θ in this case is should not be the reading on the vernier scale but should be the angle of the spectral lines relative to the central line thus for each reading of θ on the scale we had to take away 125 • to obtain the correct set of values θ co then we could work out sinθ co and plot this against the order number m. one option would be to plot this data by hand however as the range of angles gained was small roughly 20 • for each colour and because we took the measurements to 4 decimal places we decided to plot the graph on python using the sp.polyfit function we have 3 main advantages over drawing by hand the function ensures that we can draw a perfect least squares line regression line it allows us to perfectly work out the gradient of this line again something we would add errors into when finding dy and dx and it also automatically works out error bars and gradient values this would prove extremely useful when doing uncertainty calculations once the data had been compiled and the graphs were draw on python we could read off the gradient values for each of the two colours each of the gradient values was then multiplied by the slit separation d. the number of lines per unit length stated on the diffraction grating was 80 slits per millimetre however the diffraction grating in fact uses an old definition in imperial units of 2001 lines per inch this can therefore be approximated as 78.8 lines per millimetre thus the slit separation d 1.269 × 10 −5 for each colour we then used the appropriate values of n and p from the balmer series the balmer series states that the red lines come from transitions of electrons from the 3rd to the 2nd energy levels -thus n 3 for red spectral lines by the same reasoning n 5 for blue spectral lines by definition the balmer series is for when p 2 thus p 2 for both colours finally the values of n p and λ were plugged into the rydberg equation and a value of r ∞ was obtained for each colour both values were then averaged to get a final value for r ∞ the final result obtained forr ∞ from this experiment was 1.089 × 10 7 ± 82490m −1 therefore the standard accepted value of 10,973,731.6m −1 lies just outside the margin of error a table of the data representing the results for the red emission line angles is shown in table i and the results for the blue emission line angles is shown in table ii table iii shows all final results that have been derived using the methods discussed in section iv θ co represents the corrected angles explained in section iv graphs of both these sets of data are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the errors calculated in table iii were easy to calculate and merely involved using the standard error combining rules however the procedure in calculating the initial errors begins when aligning the diffraction grating when the telescope is first aligned with collimator with the cross wire focused on the central image an angle reading of 221 • 38 is taken however there is an error of ±0.5 on this reading due to this being half of the smallest measurable interval on the scale thus when the telescope is then turned through 90 • the new angle which the telescope is at is 131 • 38 ±0.5 next the diffraction grating is focused exactly at 45 • to both the telescope and the collimator again by making use of the cross wire then an angle reading of 80 • is taken using the vernier scale again once more this reading includes an error of ±0.5 thus when the diffraction grating is turned back there is yet again the same error for the same reasons therefore the diffraction grating is normal to the collimator with an error of ±1 this means that the error for any singular reading is ±1.5 as it includes the added errors of the grating calibration but also the ±0.5 error of any reading taken at an angle θ co to the central fringe the uncertainty in λ was directly calculated in python by using the functions matplotlib and scipy we were able to directly read off the uncertainties for both wavelengths σ λr 2.42nm for the red line and σ λb 6.66nm for the blue line for each colour an associated rydberg constant value could be obtained.the errors were calculated in the form k λ 2 × σ λ where k is equal to λ is the wavelength of the colour and σ λ is the uncertainty in λ. finally the two values of r ∞ are averaged and the uncertainties are added in quadrature and halved to obtain the uncertainty in r ∞ given above in this report we presented the results of an experiment to determine rydberg 's constant r ∞ by studying the spectral lines of hydrogen the data was finally compiled to determine the value of r ∞ as 1.089 × 10 7 ± 82490m −1 unfortunately the true value of 10,973,731.6 m −1 is just outside the error of margin for this result suggesting that the experiment could have been improved one aspect that could have improved the overall accuracy was carrying out the same procedure for the aqua and purple spectral lines however we were not able to clearly identify lines from these colours this may have been due to the fact that the hydrogen lamp was kept on for too long if this experiment were to be carried out again we would make sure that the lamp was turned off every 30 seconds to allow the lamp to remain cool another possibility it that the error of ±1.5 for the angles readings is indeed too low due to the small size of the vernier scale and the of taking readings using a large magnifying glass in the dark it is possible that the errors on the angles were more on the order of ±5",superficial,the
20,GS_TAP080_Redacted,in this experiment we use a grating spectrometer to obtain data on the visible emission spectrum of hydrogen to deduce the rydberg constant this required the balmer transition wavelengths of the different frequencies of light in the emission spectra which were obtained using the grating equation from each value obtained from the different frequencies of light in the spectrum we obtained a mean experimental value of 11080000 ± 30000 m −1 to 4 sf we further proceed to quantify the sources of error and identify the systematic errors resulting in the 0.97 difference from the true value error analysis gives us a revised value of 10960000 ± 40000. t his experiment relies on spectroscopy -a powerful `` noninvasive '' technique a spectrometer is an instrument which is used to study the spectrum of light from a source -light from the emission spectra of a hydrogen atom in this case a spectrometer produces a collimated beam of light using a lens or a mirror dispersing it with a grating which is then focused and viewed with an eyepiece a hydrogen lamp was used to electrically excite hydrogen atoms to produce a spectrum the spectrometer was then used to measure the angular position of each order maximum relative to the central maximum fiducial three repeats were carried out to obtain a large set of measurements on doing so the grating equation was used to plot a graph whose gradient is used to obtain the wavelength of light for each order maximum the balmer series for hydrogen was then used to obtain the rydberg constant for each colour of maximum obtained the setup of the experiment accommodates many sources of systematic error which will be recognised and accounted for in this report to produce a revised value for the rydberg constant the grating used to diffract the light emitted by the excited hydrogen atoms consists of a large number of very narrow slits each slit is separated by a distance d. a principal maximum for light of wavelength λ occurs when an integer multiple m of 2π is the phase difference between neighbouring rays of light as can be seen from figure 1 the path difference equals d sin θ. hence fig 1 this figure is a schematic representation of a spectrometer the collimating lens makes the light from the source passing through the narrow slit parallel this light travels perpendicular to the grating which is diffracted and focused onto the cross-hair by the camera a camera allows for a magnified image to be viewed through the eyepiece the inset shows the path difference d sin θ. cited from 1 and therefore where m is the order number of the maximum as an example for n 4 slits the fringe pattern shown in figure 2 occurs when n slits are illuminated the first minimum occurs at a phase angle the resolving power of the spectrometer is essential as we can identify the minimum difference in wavelength such that two spectral lines can be distinguished clearly we can find this by considering the fact that minima in a certain diffraction fig 2 the diffraction pattern seen when n 4 showing the principal minima and maxima cited from 1 pattern occur at the same position as the maxima in a different pattern this can be seen in figure 3 where light having a second wavelength λ 2 λ − ∆λ produces its m th principal maximum at a slightly different angle θ 2 where d sin θ 2 mλ 2 a minimum will occur at angle θ if by substituting for d sin θ using equations 5 and 6 the difference in wavelength ∆λ λ−λ 2 where ∆λ λ. consequently where λ ∆λ is the resolving power r. this means that the smallest difference in wavelengths ∆λ which can be distinguished at a wavelength λ can be found halfway between two equal spectral lines the intensity is approximately 20 less than the peak equation 8 represents the separation at which this occurs and thus the two lines are distinguishable from each other in this experiment we use a 300 lines per mm grating which means n is large and hence ∆λ is small which means the spectrometer can resolve spectral lines to a very small difference in wavelengths the rydberg formula for the transition wavelengths in hydrogen is given by where r ∞ is the rydberg constant and n and p are integers representing the energy levels of the initial and final states of the hydrogen atom respectively the accurately measured value of the rydberg constant r ∞ is 10973731.6 m −1 r ∞ can be expressed in terms of fundamental constants as where α is the fine structure constant m e the mass of the electron c the speed of light and h planck 's constant α can be expressed as where h is the reduced planck constant e is the charge of an electron and 0 the permittivity of free space noting that α is dimensionless where 1/α ∼ 134.036. the balmer series is the series of spectral lines emitted by an excited hydrogen atom in the visible spectrum and is given by equation 9 with the values of p 2 and n 3 4 5 .. this is for the atom dropping from the n th energy level to the second i.e p 2 energy level figure 4 shows this for n 3 4 with p 2. this causes a photon of frequency in the visible spectrum to be given off by using a colour chart and equation 9 it is possible to calculate the expected values of λ and identify the colours of light expected to be observed in the spectrum references 1 and 2 were used to explain the theory the spectrometer needed careful adjustment and setting up before it could be used a schematic representation of the spectrometer is shown in figure 1. we adjusted the eyepiece by observing the emission spectra of sodium atoms using a sodium lamp such that the image was at a convenient viewing distance we use a sodium lamp for adjustments instead of a hydrogen lamp because leaving the hydrogen lamp for too long causes weak transitions from molecular hydrogen to be observed but most importantly the hydrogen lines grow weaker and dimmer in time and become difficult to observe the camera lens was focused by bringing a distant object into focus -in our case we focused on a lamp-post on the street we do this so that there is no parallax between the cross hair and the image the telescope was then aligned with the axis of the collimator the sodium lamp was placed close to the slit and the focus of the collimator was adjusted to produce a sharp image of the slit at the cross hair we set the cross hair to an `` x '' rather than a `` '' as this makes it easier to focus its centre on the centre of a maximum thereby achieving a more accurate measurement of the angular displacement it was very important to understand what each clamp screw and slow motion drive did as turning the wrong one could disrupt the whole setup the rotating telescope scale reads from 0 − 360 • the scale is read relative to a zero fiducial reading on the vernier scale which is fixed to the rotating table base the vernier scale reads in arcminutes or sixtieths of a degree the telescope was then moved through precisely 90 • and clamped into position a mirror was put into the grating holder and the grating table was turned until a reflected image of the slit was seen in the eyepiece doing this ensures that the incident beam from the collimator is 45 • to the mirror surface this was confirmed by now replacing the mirror with the 300 lines per mm grating many orange sodium spectral lines were observed but lining the median line with the crosshair ensures that the grating surface is 45 • to the beam the grating surface is fragile and hence great care was taken not to touch it the screws under the grating table were used to set the height of the slit image the aperture was decreased to obtain a solid vertical spectral line the grating drive was used to set the grating such that the slit image is precisely at the cross hair noting the reading on both the scales as an initial reading the grating was then rotated precisely through 45 • this ensures the grating is accurately set and the beam is normal to its surface the spectral lines were observed through the telescope and were noted to be above the plane defined by the cross hair this occurred because the grating rulings were not parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope to correct this a diffracted image of the slit at a large angle of diffraction was observed the appropriate grating adjustment screws were used to rotate the grating in the plane of its surface to lower the image it is essential to only rotate the grating in the plane of its surface to ensure that the incident beam is still normal to its surface we could now proceed with the experiment to use the spectrometer to make accurate repeatable measurements the sodium lamp was now replaced with the hydrogen lamp the main scale reading combined with the vernier scale reading gave the total angle the vernier scale reading was obtained by observing which vernier ruling lined up with a ruling on the fixed scale the angular displacement of the central pink maximum relative to the 0 • mark was recorded this was the fiducial relative to which θ for each order maxima m was measured both positive and negative order maxima were observed and three repeats were obtained on having collected the data a python program was written which plotted sin θ against order m. according to equation 3 the gradient of the line of best fit obtained equals λ d therefore where d 10 −3 /300 this gives λ for each of the 3 colours -blue cyan and red observed in the spectrum also known as h-γ h-β and h-α respectively the values obtained are shown in table i to 4 significant figures as this was the accuracy of θ measured by the spectrometer blue/h-γ 430.0 ± 1.8 nm cyan/h-β 483.2 ± 2.1 nm red/h-α 646.9 ± 4.7 nm table i wavelengths of the three observed spectral colours consequently equation 9 can be used to obtain r ∞ from each value of wavelength as the values for the rydberg constant obtained from different colours are shown in table ii the mean experimental value for r ∞ and its uncertainty was calculated to be r ∞ 11 080 000 ± 30 000 m −1 14 as seen in figure 6 the relationship between order m and sin θ for all three values of λ followed a linear relationship this result agrees with what is predicted by equation 3 however the balmer series includes other prominent lines as seen in figure 5 -several close to ultravoilet and hence not clearly visible but one in the visible spectrum with λ 410 nm which is not seen this may mean that the hydrogen atoms were not excited enough to produce this line or that it was too dark to be seen perhaps a better lamp and a darker room would allow for this spectral line to be observed the values for λ obtained from each gradient yield a minimal uncertainty as is seen in table i -the largest percentage uncertainty being 0.72 for red light d had negligible uncertainty which implies that the uncertainty in the values of λ was only dependent on the uncertainty in the gradient of the line of best fit from equation 12 the uncertainty in the gradient was dependent on the consistency and accuracy of our measurements for θ. as the spectrometer is a very accurate instrument capable of a precision of under three parts in ten thousand 1 the error did not originate from the limitations of the setup but was systematic further n and p are constants and hence the systematic error in r ∞ originates from that in λ. our value for r ∞ as given in equation 14 differed by 0.97 from the true value further an error of 0.31 on the mean is very small and does not include the true value this suggests the presence of a small systematic error there are several potential sources of systematic error parallax was the major source of systematic error as we had to use a magnifying glass to identify the position where the vernier rulings coincide with the fixed scale rulings from various viewing angles the rulings were very close to each other the process even more difficult we estimated the error in θ due to this difficulty as 2 arcminutes and parallax as 1 arcminute to the vernier reading -a total error of 3 arcminutes these errors were included in the previous calculations but i believe parallax would have added an error of 0.2 • to our central maximum fiducial reading if this is accounted for the modified python code produces the revised value of r ∞ r ∞ 10 960 000 ± 40 000 m −1 15 as can be seen in equation 15 the revised r ∞ and its error includes the true value it now differs from the true value by 0.1 the zero error on the scales was non existent however as the experiment was performed on two separate days this meant that we had to use the instrument as was set-up by the group preceding us there may have been a change in the spectrometer used thus ever so slightly affecting measurements even though we re-configured the entire instrument additionally we had to re-configure the spectrometer as the wrong clamp screw was turned which meant that the scales were not fixed and our setup was disrupted when the telescope was moved this may have caused the telescope to be slightly mis-aligned with the collimator while measuring θ the table that the spectrometer sits on would move slightly which would be re-adjusted this would slightly affect lamp position even though we had marked the fixed position of the lamp relative to the table this could potentially add some error further not focusing the cross-hair on the exact centre of the spectral line may have also caused a very slight error in θ in the order of less than 1 arcminute -negligible background light from the computers and lamps being used by the other groups performing the experiment would sometimes be seen through the telescope which made focusing the cross-hair difficultperhaps adding an error in the order of less than 1 arcminute as well although negligible if all these sources of systematic error were accounted for by re-visiting the experiment and quantifying the errors as with parallax the value for r ∞ achieved would be even closer to the true value reducing the percentage difference to smaller than even 0.1 while reducing the error on it v. conclusion in this report we aimed to calculate the rydberg constant by using a spectrometer we measured the angular displacement of each order maximum the grating equation was used to calculate the wavelengths of the spectral lines observed eventually the balmer series for hydrogen was used to obtain a value for the rydberg constant our initial value r ∞ 11080000 ± 30000 m −1 differed by 0.97 from the true value after accounting for the sources of systematic error in the experiment with the major source being parallax the revised value r ∞ 10960000 ± 40000 m −1 differed only by 0.1 and included the true value within the error further sources of error which would decrease the percentage difference even more were also suggested this indicates that the experiment was a success in obtaining an accurate value for r ∞ to improve the experiment further we would complete the entire experiment in one day instead -thus eliminating the effect of a change of set-up furthermore taking additional repeats would only reduce the error on the value this experiment highlighted the need for error analysis and how to account for systematic errors the experience gained in python error propagation will be useful for future experiments,prediction,bal
21,GS_WFX625_Redacted,this paper discusses the method used to outline an experiment to determine a value for rydberg 's constant using a hydrogen lamp and a grating spectrometer to determine the wavelengths of the various spectral lines we took data for the two most visible spectral lines red and blue and calculated a value for rydberg 's constant from both we obtained a final value of 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 despite the experimental method we used having low systematic and random error due to the high resolution of the grating spectrometer used we believe the final result 's error is mainly due to the fact that only the red and blue spectral lines were used this is because they were the only two spectral lines we could take accurate and precise data for he rydberg constant is an important constant linking the wavelengths of several elements spectra with their atomic structure and was originally introduced by johannes robert rydberg 1854-1919 when he published his findings in 1890 on the emission spectra of certain elements 1 originally of empirical nature the rydberg constant is used in an equation that attempts to find some sort of order in the lines of emission spectra of the elements when precise measurements of the wavelengths of the emission spectra of the elements were carried out it soon became clear that some of the lines fell into patterns the lines would start out initially spaced out and start to crowd together these patterns were called 'spectral series and as the different lines in the series can be labeled n n+1 n+2 and so forth the corresponding wavelengths labeled as 𝜆n physicists began to explore and try and find the mathematical relationship between 𝜆n and n. rydberg analytically found a solution the problem with the equation 𝑛 𝑁 0 where n is the wavenumber 1/𝜆 where 𝜆 is the wavelength n0 is rydberg 's constant first calculated to be 109721.6cm -1 and m and p are integers that are specific to the members of the series 1 rydberg found that his equation fit the balmer series the spectral series for the emission spectrum of hydrogen using p 2 and m ≥ 3. this equation provided an accurate representation for many spectral series of different elements but was conceived purely through observation and calculation the scientific theory to support it came more than 20 years later when bohr used the idea that the frequency of the photon emitted by an atom was directly proportional to the difference in energy states which gave m and p meaning the initial and final energy states 2 the rydberg constant could now be expressed as where r is the rydberg constant with an accepted measured value of 10973731.6m -1 me the mass of the electron c the speed of light h plank 's constant and 𝛼 the fine structure constant which can be further expressed by the following equation where e is the charge of an electron 𝜖0 is the permittivity of free space and h is the reduced planck constant in our experiment we observed the emission spectrum of hydrogen with a grating spectrometer in order to find a value for rydberg 's constant a grating spectrometer was necessary so we could take multiple readings and measure the wavelengths of different members of the balmer series although due to experimental conditions only the first two red and blue were clearly visible enough to take consistent recordings the diffraction grating is simply a large number n of narrow slits all an equal d away from each other 3 the path difference between neighbouring rays from a diffraction grating is 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 and so where m is the order number of the diffraction pattern this shows that as d and 𝜆 are constant 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 and the order number should be directly proportional we used this fact by measuring the angle at successive order numbers and graphing of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against the order number to yield a straight line with gradient equal to 𝜆/d in this experiment we used a diffraction grating with 78.8 lines per millimeter which means d is 0.127mm using the grating spectrometer as shown in fig 1 required setup and calibration of the three sections of the equipment firstly we had to adjust the camera so it would be in focus with collimated light we did this by pointing determining rydberg 's constant using a grating spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp t the camera at an object on the other side of the laboratory room about 30m away as the object is sufficiently far enough away that the light rays coming from it will be collimated themselves now that the camera was calibrated for collimated light we adjusted the collimator by rotating the camera back in line with the collimator and using a sodium lamp we used sodium lamps as a substitute for hydrogen lamps as they do not heat up as easily and we would have to turn off the hydrogen lamps every few minutes which would disrupt the calibration we adjusted the focus ring on the collimator until the slit through which the light was coming through was in focus with the diffraction grating now in place we now aligned the camera with the grating in order to align them we used the vernier scales which could measure the angle at a resolution of 1 arcminute all angle measurements had a very small uncertainty of ±1 arcminute as we had a magnifying glass and took careful measurements each time finally we adjusted the orientation of the grating by adjusting the screws on the platform that held it this is key as it ensures that the distance between adjacent slits is d as if it had been rotated the distance would actually be dcosθ where θ is the angle between the horizontal plane and the bottom of the grating we ensured that the angle was minimized by using the camera and diffraction grating themselves by rotating and slowly sweeping the camera through the various orders we observed the lines gradually getting higher due to the grating 's orientation we adjusted the orientation to minimize this effect and stopped when the effect was not noticeable the grating spectrometer was now ready to be used we the sodium lamp for a hydrogen lamp and adjusted the slit width on the collimator to find a balance between allowing enough light through to be able to the spectral lines of higher orders but not too much that the lines would be out of focus we began measuring the angles of the camera whenever the crosshair aligned with a spectral line for successive order numbers we decided to adjust the orientation of the crosshair so that the lines were at a 45° angle this made it considerably easier to estimate the position of a spectral line we believe this is due to the four lines acting as a reference to compare the position of the spectral line to whereas if the crosshair was rotated vertically so the orientation has that of a '+ sign the horizontal lines do not help us at all in closing down on a spectral line we measured and recorded once again with a resolution of 1 arcminute the angle for ±3 orders including the zeroth order of the diffraction patterns of the blue and red spectral lines in order to determine their wavelength although there were other colours present they were too faint to get consistent reliable results with a large enough range the results for the angles of the various orders of the red and blue spectral lines are shown in table 1 the results show a clear trend of a roughly 3° interval between red orders and a roughly 2° interval between blue orders this is consistent with what we expected as red light has a larger wavelength than blue light from equation 4 we can see that sinθ is proportional to the wavelength of the light and with a range roughly twenty to thirty degrees we know that θ will be roughly proportional with sinθ θ will increase with sinθ we plotted a scatterplot of our results of sinθ against the order and calculated the line of best fit by using the scipy polyfit function weighting the points all equally as we saw no anomalies and plotted the line using the scipy poly1d function the lines of best fit are shown in fig 2 the different gradients clearly show the different wavelengths for red and blue light note that sinθ does not equal 0 at the zeroth order as we decided to keep the starting angle consistent with our results and not make everything relative to a zeroth order of 0° fig 3 shows our results relative to 0° at the zeroth order to show the results from the grating spectrometer where 'red angle and 'blue angle are the angles for the red spectral line and blue spectral line respectively we originally recorded the results starting at order 0 and worked our way into the positive orders first we checked the zeroth order again to have the same reference point for the negative orders but did not record a mean average as they were the same for both the red and blue spectral lines the results show a clear trend of a roughly 3 interval between red orders and a roughly 2 interval between blue orders a grating spectrometer fig 1 a diagram to show the grating spectrometer that we used in the experiment divided into three main parts the collimator the prism table that housed the grating and the telescope or camera that contained the eyepiece for us to observe the spectral lines through 4 the most noticeable difference would be that the lines of best fit now have a positive gradient and they both cross exactly at the zeroth order which was not the case before there was a 7 arcminute difference between the two as our final result for calculating rydberg 's constant is dependent on the gradient of the straight lines the fact that they perfectly cross is not important and it is merely a translation of the two lines however changing the starting point so that the angle is 0° at the zeroth order is important as the different values of sinθ will be different at this range most notably there are values of sinθ which are positive but as the sin curve does not have a constant gradient different starting points will yield different gradients for our lines of best fit this is key as it will affect our final value when calculating rydberg 's constant and so we decided to stay true to our results using equation 4 as the equation of our line of best fit we used 𝜆/d is the gradient of the two straight lines we calculated the wavelengths of the two spectral lines to be 6.16 × 10 −7 𝑚 ± 0.10 × 10 −7 𝑚 ±1.62 for red light and 4.41 × 10 −7 𝑚 ± 0.09 × 10 −7 𝑚 ±2.04 for blue light we calculated the error in the gradient of the straight lines using the covariant matrix generated from the sp.polyfit function we then calculated the rydberg constant using equation 1 and using p as 2 and m as 3 and 4 for red and blue light respectively we calculated the rydberg constant to be 10733268.1292m -1 using the red wavelength and 11106867.2335m -1 using the blue wavelength we found that the mean average for the rydberg constant was 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 despite measuring the angles for the diffracted spectral to a high degree of accuracy and precision using the vernier scales with a resolution of 1 arcminute we believe that the fact that we only managed to use two spectral lines red and blue meant that ultimately our final result had a high standard deviation and therefore error had we been able to see other spectral lines and record data for them we would have been able to greatly reduce our standard deviation in our final result overall throughout the experiment we believe we kept the experimental error low due to our careful experimental technique however we were not able to take multiple repeats due to time constraints which could have helped to reduce random error and increase the accuracy of our final result but not much as we encountered no anomalies and all of the data points are within the straight best fit line we had calculated the error bars using the worst case scenario of ±0.5° on all of our angles as the exact position of the spectral lines of higher orders were harder to discern having only seven data points was not ideal either as this increased the uncertainty and error of the gradients of the straight lines although increasing the number of data points would prove difficult due to the fact that any orders above three became increasingly difficult to make out and this would then increase the overall uncertainty for each value of the angles the aim of this experiment was to determine the value for rydberg 's constant using a grating spectrometer with a 78.8 line/mm grating and a hydrogen lamp using a hydrogen lamp allowed us to calculate rydberg 's constant using the balmer series by measuring the angles for the various orders of red and blue spectral lines we obtained a final experimental value for the rydberg constant of 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 and decided the largest source of error was due to the fact that we only used two different spectral lines which gave a high standard deviation for our final result we believe this error could be reduced by changing the lighting conditions such that the other spectral lines can be seen and attempting to take data for higher orders of the diffracted lines graph of results fig 2 a scatterplot and straight line of best fit for both the red and blue spectral lines although there were no anomalies the 0 order for the red and blue spectral lines did differ slightly but are within each other given the error bars graph of results with 0 at order zero fig 3 the same results yield a slightly different scatterplot and lines of best fit note that this time both lines cross exactly at the origin as they have been made to do so,superficial,bal
22,GS_CZD812_Redacted,a grating spectrometer has been set up in order to take accurate measurements of angular displacements from the central maximum of spectral emission lines from a hydrogen discharge lamp then using the rydberg formula and the diffraction equation an average experimental value for the rydberg constant has been determined which has been found to be 10 921 266.74 ± 197 635.84 m -1 the percentage difference between the experimental value and the theoretical value calculated using some fundamental constants in atomic physics has been computed to be 0.54 the grating spectrometer is an apparatus that makes use of a combination of lenses and a diffraction grating in order to separate light into its component colours using the wave properties of interference and diffraction one application of this instrument is the technique of spectroscopy which is an important technique that physicists use when studying a wide range of objects including hot solids hot gases and cold gases this technique is used in order to find the elements which an object is made of as each element has its own unique emission spectrum amongst those things that can be studied using spectroscopy there is hydrogen gas investigating the emission line spectrum of the light emitted by a hydrogen discharge lamp by measuring the angular displacement of its spectral lines using a grating spectrometer can be used to determine the value of the rydberg constant this is a quantity named after the swedish physicist johannes rydberg who did work on the hydrogen spectrum 1 the rydberg constant is very significant in atomic physics owing to its connection to the fundamental physical constants m c e h and ε 0 these constants are defined in section ii.ii a diffraction grating is a flat sheet of glass or metal ruled with straight slits with equal distances between them the diffraction grating of the grating spectrometer has slits which are n -1 m apart where n is the number of slits per metre when two rays emerging from the slits interfere then there is a maximum i.e constructive interference when their phase difference is 2πn where n 1 2 3 … where is the wavelength of the light through the diffraction grating the path difference is s n θ hence where n is the order number of the maxima in the interference pattern n 1 is for the two maxima on either side closest to the principal maximum n 2 is for the two second-closest maxima and so on θ is the angular displacement of the order maximum from the principal maximum and d n -1 of the diffraction grating therefore the final formula is by rearranging equation 1 the formula is equation 2 shows that if d is known and θ and n are determined experimentally using the grating spectrometer then a graph of s n θ on the y-axis and n on the x-axis can be plotted the gradient of this graph multiplied by d would give the wavelength of the monochromatic light 2 ii.ii the rydberg equation and emission spectra the rydberg equation `` is a theoretical prediction of the wavelengths found in the emission line spectrum of hydrogen atoms '' 1 these wavelengths are given by the formula where is the wavelength of the photon emitted from the electron transition or absorbed if the electron starts out at the lower energy level instead of the higher onefor an absorption spectrum r is the rydberg constant and n and p are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final energy level of the electron respectively for an emission line spectrum the principal quantum number is the number given to each orbit the smallest orbit has principal quantum number 1 the next orbit has number 2 and so on in ascending order of size see fig 1 3 figure 1 electron orbits with the principal quantum numbers and the balmer electron transitions 4 the rydberg constant r ∞ can be expressed by the physical fundamental constants where m is the mass of the electron e is the charge of the electron ε 0 is the permittivity of free space h is planck 's constant a c is the speed of light in a vacuum 1 if p 2 and n is set to the integers from 3 to 7 in equation 3 then the subsequent wavelengths calculated make up the balmer series of the spectral lines for atomic hydrogen see fig 1 which represents all the electron transitions down to orbit 2. the calculated wavelengths are part of the visible spectrum and one spectral line wavelength is in the ultraviolet region 1 iii the experimental method in order to measure the angular displacements of spectral lines from a hydrogen lamp at the first the grating spectrometer needed to be set up and calibrated see fig 2 for final grating spectrometer setup for the setup instead of using a hydrogen lamp a sodium lamp was used because a hydrogen lamp gets hot fairly quickly so it was n't suitable for setup because setting up the spectrometer took about an hour and fifteen minutes 2 at first the eyepiece was focused on the crosswire and then the camera lens was focused such that a distant object is focused on the cross wire for the second part the distant object was a tree the grating spectrometer was taken to be pointed out of the window 2 afterwards the telescope was turned to be aligned with the axis of the collimator the collimator focus was adjusted to get a sharp image of the crosswire 2 then the telescope was moved through 90° and a diffraction grating d 1/ 3x10 5 m was placed in the holder then the grating table was turned until a reflected image of the entrance slit was seen this aligned with the cross hair such that the image through the eyepiece was a cross shape with a vertical orange line through the middle which was the spectral emission line of the sodium vapour this indicated that the grating surface was at 45° to the axis of the collimator then the telescope was turned through 90° again so that it was in line with the axis of the collimator and the diffraction grating was turned so that its surface was normal to the axis 2 figure 2 the final setup of the grating spectrometer the problem encountered here was that the spectral lines had a thickness also some difficulty was encountered when adjusting the telescope position so the cross hair intersection would be in the middle of it thus this was a source of error however my lab partner and i decided that the thickness of the line was n't thick enough for the error to not be negligible the spectral lines had a thickness because energy levels are n't infinitely sharp due to hyperfine splittingthe zeeman effect splitting of spectral lines due to a b-field there were magnetic objects around the apparatus in the room such as metal paperclips and other apparatuses with magnetic metal components but their effects were very subtle as hyperfine splitting was n't observed in addition the negligible error is justified also because the temperature in the room was quite standard and did n't affect the hydrogen gas to the extent that we could n't ignore it so thermal doppler broadening did n't affect our subsequent measurements either 2 5 after the setup we interpreted the spectral line in the eyepiece to be the central maximum of the diffraction pattern because the telescope was aligned with the axis of the collimator ideally the central maximum should have zero angular displacement from the axis of the collimator and the slit image in the eyepiece was the closest to the central maximum with almost zero angular displacement from the central maximum 2 iii.ii determining the rydberg constant after setting up the spectrometer to take accurate measurements of angular displacement of spectral emission lines the sodium lamp was replaced with the hydrogen lamp during the course of the experiment although we were told that the lamp should be turned off every 10 minutes for about 15-20 minutes it was kept on for the entirety of the experiment as it was advised that instead the lamp should be turned off when the spectral lines start flickering which did n't happen when aligned with the principal axis of the collimator the scale on the spectrometer read 80.40 ± 0.05° and this angle was decided to be the reference angle for the n th order maxima 0.05° 3 minutes of arc was decided to be the absolute uncertainty for each angle measurement for the following reasons  deciding where the measurement markings line up was quite difficult because the scale was small and while trying to read it  i was in an awkward position because the other components of the spectrometer got in my way  we decided that getting the measurement wrong by more than 3 minutes of arc was highly unlikely  the room was dark and a magnifying glass with a light was required to be used to read the scale and even then the scale was difficult to read  parallax error is not likely because the scales were very close together and it was tested that my position when reading the scale did n't affect it o it was tested by me reading the 80.4° reading from different positions and as far as i could tell the measurement did n't change when looking through the eyepiece the observation was that there were 3 different colours and hence 3 different wavelengths of light these were red pinkish light blue almost turquoise and violet almost purple the order from the central maximum was that red was first and then light blue and then violet on both sides of the central maximum we were expecting to see four lines because according to the balmer series and the rydberg equation see section ii.ii we therefore believed that the 4 th spectral line was too close to the ultraviolet region for us to see or just in that region equation 1 is for monochromatic light and there were 3 different wavelengths shown so the results for n and θ were collected separately for each colour and 3 different tables and graphs were plotted for each colour in order to take measurements for each wavelength the telescope started out at the central maximum and then was turned until the cross hair intersection aligned with the middle of the nth order spectral line this was done on both sides of the principal maximum and went up to n 3. it could n't go further because the intensity became too low especially for the violet wavelength where we could n't take measurements for n 3 on both sides due to that reason in addition the spectrometer was set up next to a wall so the telescope was n't able to go further on one side of the principal maximum only because the wall was blocking it apart from the uncertainty in the angular displacement of the maxima there were n't any other uncertainties for any other quantity in equation 1. from the 3 graphs the gradients multiplied by d gave 3 different wavelengths the longest for red and the shortest for violet these results were then used in equation 3 with n 3 for red n 4 for light blue and n 5 for violet for the red and light blue wavelengths 6 readings of θ were taken in total going up to n 3 for each side for the violet wavelength only 4 readings were taken up to n 2. hence the uncertainty in r ∞ calculated from violet light was expected to be larger than the other two graph 1 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for red light the graph for red light see graph 1 was computed by python to have the equation 5 the gradient of the graph was multiplied by d to give the wavelength of the red light which turned out to be 659.33 ± 7.03 nm see equation 2 graph 2 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for light blue light in the same way for light blue light see graph 2 the equation of the graph was 6 hence by using the same method as for the red light see equation 2 the wavelength of the light blue spectral line was determined to be 491.33 ± 6.20 nm graph 3 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for violet light for violet light python computed the equation of the graph to be 7 the resulting wavelength was 433.66 ± 13.40 nm the absolute uncertainty for violet light was greater than the uncertainties for red and light blue light as expected because it had two less readings in addition the error bars are shown to be visibly larger for violet light as shown by comparing graphs 1 2 and 3. the errors on the wavelengths σ were calculated using the following method where σ is the absolute uncertainty in the gradient computed by python using σ θ 3 minutes of arc using these wavelengths and equation 3 the rydberg constants determined from each wavelength were the following  for red light r ∞ 10 920 176.54 ± 116 545.04 m -1 the uncertainty here is 1.07  for light blue light r ∞ 10 854 890.47 ± 136 975.80 m -1 the uncertainty here is 1.26  for violet light r ∞ 10 988 733.21 ± 339 386.68 m -1 the uncertainty here is 3.09 about 3 times the uncertainties for blue and red which is expected as mentioned before therefore the final value of the rydberg constant was calculated to be 10 921 266.74 ± 197 635.84 m -1 the resulting uncertainty was calculated to be 1.81 using equation 4 the rydberg constant was calculated to be 10 980 368.06 m -1 and this theoretical result was within the experimental result 's range the difference between the theoretical and the experimental value was determined to be 0.54 to summarise in this experiment i set up a grating spectrometer in order to take accurate measurements of the angular displacements of n th order maxima from the 0 th order maximum i did this for 3 different wavelengths which were 3 spectral lines corresponding to 3 different electron transitions to energy level 2 in hydrogen using my data i determined my experimental value of the rydberg constant and compared it to the value of r ∞ i calculated using equation 4 using known values see appendix 2 one improvement on my experimental method would be to repeat the measurements i made as i only recorded one measurement for each wavelength and for each order then i would 've been able to improve the precision of my results and hence the error bars on graphs 1 2 and 3 would 've been smaller i would 've been able to achieve better overall accuracy in the experiment a possible source of error that i did n't take into account is the diffraction grating although it was written on the grating frame that n 300 lines per mm i did n't find out whether that claim was actually true or not also by looking at the grating spectrometer setup fig 2 it can be seen that clamps were used to hold the diffraction grating which could 've bent it and therefore affected the results other factors which i could 've taken into account to improve my results are things such as spectrometer misalignment because even after trying to align the spectrometer the slit image in the eyepiece was n't completely vertical air pressure might also affect the hydrogen atoms in the hydrogen discharge lamp in addition the rydberg formula itself which is a result of the bohr model of hydrogen is n't completely accurate and has its limitations the bohr model assumes that the nucleus of the hydrogen has infinite mass hence the notation r ∞ and that the proton is stationary in reality both the proton and the electron rotate around their common centre of mass see figure 3 6 `` it turns out that this motion can be taken into account by not using the electron 's rest mass in equation 4 but instead the reduced mass of the proton and the electron to get more accurate results '' for my experiments i could 've used the reduced mass of the system bibliography 1 freedman r et al,superficial,exp
23,GS_LXZ649_Redacted,the rydberg constant was found to be r∞ 1.080 ± 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 which lies within our uncertainty of the codata accepted value it was determined by first using a grating spectrometer to observe and measure the angle of maxima for balmer series photons emitted from a hydrogen lamp graphs were used to find the wavelengths of the different light in the balmer series and these wavelengths were plotted using the rydberg equation to find the rydberg constant t his experiment was conducted to accurately determine the rydberg constant which is one of the most accurately measured physical constants 1 the rydberg constant first appeared as an empirical constant in the rydberg formula 1 when johannes rydberg generalised the balmer equation found by johann balmer to transitions between any two energy levels in hydrogen niels bohr later demonstrated that the rydberg constant could be calculated using more fundamental constants by adopting the bohr model as seen in equations 4 5 the rydberg constant is thus strongly related to the fine structure constant which is in turn related to the fundamental probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon 2 and so is of extreme theoretical importance previously the rydberg constant was experimentally determined via the spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen a proton and an electron as in this experiment however in a more recent experiment the lamb shift of muonic hydrogen a proton and negative muon was measured using pulsed laser spectroscopy which suggested the accepted value of the rydberg constant should be changed by almost 5 standard deviations 3 the current codata accepted value of the rydberg constant is r ∞ 10973731.568508 ± 0.000065 m −1 4 this means that the rydberg constant is known with an extremely low percentage uncertainty of less than 6 × 10 −10 i n a gas-discharge hydrogen lamp the electric field causes some atoms near the anode to positively ionise freeing electrons the free electrons then move to the anode the cations protons formed by the ionisation are now attracted to the cathode and so are accelerated eventually they collide with a neutral atom which transfers electrons to the cation when the electron is transferred it falls from higher energy levels to lower ones in the hydrogen atom thus emitting a photon to conserve energy as its potential energy decreases note these lamps are fundamentally different to incandescent lamps where a whole nearly continuous spectrum of light is emitted the wavelength λ of the photon emitted in the hydrogen gas-discharge lamp is given by the equation 1 originally posited by johannes rydberg where p is the initial principle quantum number and q is the final principle quantum number thus the rydberg constant may be found if λ p and q are known the rydberg constant can be interpreted as the highest wavenumber of a photon possible emitted from an electron decreasing its energy level in hydrogen by taking p 1 and q ∞ the light from the lamp may be passed through a lens to collimate the light before being dispersed by a diffraction grating if we assume the grating slit width is small compared with the wavelength we can assume the light will diffract uniformly this allows each slit to act as a secondary source the light from each secondary source will then interfere with light from other secondary sources in this case an interference pattern will be produced in which the angle θ at which each order maximum appears is given by equation 2 where n is the order of the maximum and d is the slit spacing 5 using a diffraction grating reduces the intensity of the light between the maxima and so increases the resolving power of the apparatus the points where lines of light appear in the pattern are points where the phase shift between light from each secondary source or slit is very close to 0. wavelengths observable by the human eye lie in the range 390nm to 700nm the balmer series is the set of spectral lines for hydrogen emissions when an electron transfers from an energy level p 2 to q 2. the balmer series is shown in figure 1. a subset of the balmer series h α h β h γ and h δ lie in the visible range and these are the wavelengths that are measured during the experiment the balmer series is particularly useful in astronomy as hydrogen is the most common element in the universe the doppler shift of a star 's balmer series will indicate its radial velocity and the relative intensity of each member of the series will indicate the temperature the balmer series wavelengths may be found using equation 1 setting p 2 and letting q 3 4 5 .... ∞ the balmer series tends to a wavelength of 346.6nm at q ∞ the resolving power ∆λ of the grating spectrometer is given by equation 3 where n is the number of slits ∆λ is a measure of whether two similar wavelengths are distinguishable by using the bohr model which places electrons orbiting in progressively larger circles centred on a small massive positive nucleus the rydberg constant may be derived in terms of fundamental constants where m e is the electron rest mass e is the elementary charge 0 is the permittivity of free space h is planck 's constant and c is the speed of light in a vacuum once the rydberg constant is found it can be used to determine the fine-structure constant α using equation 5 the fine structure constant can be interpreted in varying different ways the most basic is perhaps the ratio of the potential energy of two electrons a distance d apart and the energy of a photon with wavelength 2πd the fine structure constant is used in perturbative quantum electrodynamics calculations f irst the grating spectrometer as shown in figure 2 was calibrated using a sodium gas-discharge lamp the eyepiece was focused on the cross-wire and the camera focused on a distant object 20m the slit width was set to as small as possible for accurate calibration the telescope was then aligned with the collimator axis the grating was then set at 45 • and the telescope rotated 90 • allowing the grating height to be properly set when the grating and telescope were then rotated back to their 0 • positions the grating rulings were checked to lie along the axis of rotation of the telescope as the interference pattern was still in the plane of the telescope the cross-wire was rotated so that it formed an x rather than a '+ shape allowing for better precision and accuracy when the telescope is aimed at a line the grating with the highest number of slits was used as this increased the resolving power and therefore the accuracy and precision of measurements the grating used had 300 lines per mm which gave d 3.3 × 10 −6 m. once calibrated the sodium lamp was replaced by a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp the telescope was rotated slowly and each colour line the colour and the angle change from the 0 • line was recorded using the vernier scale this was repeated for the `` negative '' order lines in order to acquire more data and negate small effects of incorrect calibration this process was repeated 3 times and the mean taken for each colour 's order line data was collected for order lines between −3 and 3 inclusive the line for h δ was too dim to be observed in the experiment the data was taken quickly as the hydrogen lamp quickly heats up too much and the probability of the required transitions occurring decreases causing the visible lines in the interference pattern to dim a dark room was used in order to better see the interference lines and therefore increase precision the higher order lines e.g n 3 are dimmer and therefore it was necessary to increase the width of the collimator slit to allow more light from the lamp to enter the apparatus and therefore increase the intensity of the lines t he graph for each colour 's d sin θ against n is shown in figure 3. this graph is plotted based on equation 2 each data point is the mean of the three repeats taken the uncertainty in the y-axis are found using the standard error formula given in the lab manual 8 based on equation 2 where σ y is the y-axis error and σ θ is the error in θ which by considering the vernier scale and the possibility of incorrect calibration was determined to be σ θ 0.05 • this value for uncertainty was chosen based on the resolution for the vernier scale being 1 60 • and considering the error for calibrating the spectrometer however it may be a slight overestimate given how exactly the line fits the points in the σ y calculation the uncertainty in the grating spacing d was assumed to be negligible σ d 0 as diffraction gratings are manufactured extremely well the x-axis errors were also assumed to be negligible σ x 0 as it is easy to check which order line the light appeared at the gradient of this graph for each data set gives the wavelength of the emitted light as shown in the table to reduce uncertainty for wavelengths more repeats and a larger range of order lines could be used the highest order line taken was 3 as the lines were becoming too dim to accurately measure the position of if a brighter hydrogen lamp were used then this problem would be negated using these wavelength values along with p 2 and q 3 4 5 figure 4 was plotted where the gradient gives the rydberg constant here we have assumed that the visible wavelengths will be emitted by electrons falling from the third fourth and fifth energy levels to the second the gradient found from this graph was r ∞ 1.080 × 10 7 m −1 three points is generally considered insufficient for statistically analysis however these were the only three wavelengths both in the visible spectrum and intense enough to be easily observed the errors in wavelength were found using a covalence matrix of each set of data in figure 3 and then the error in inverse found again using the standard error equation 7. it is clear from the graph that the uncertainty in the purple point is relatively larger indicating that θ for the dim purple line was occasionally measured and confused with the brighter purple line this is also evident when the measured purple wavelength is compared with the accepted values for balmer series wavelengths the uncertainty for r ∞ was calculated by taking the root mean squared error between each value predicted by the fit line and the measured data point this value was found to be σ r∞ 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 this equates to a percentage uncertainty of 1.67 therefore the final value of the rydberg constant is r ∞ 1.080 ± 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 it would be possible to decrease uncertainty in the wavelengths and therefore r ∞ by taking more repeats to drive down statistical uncertainty another possibility is to use a vernier scale with even higher resolution although the resolution is already very good o verall the experiment was very successful the initial goal of calculating the rydberg constant was achieved with extremely low uncertainties of 1.67 largely due to the use of the vernier scale and diffraction grating the value of the rydberg constant that we found was r ∞ 1.080 ± 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 which is very close to and within our uncertainty of the codata accepted value of r ∞ 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 if the experiment were to be repeated a darker room and brighter hydrogen lamp could be used in order to improve the visibility of the lines and thereby increase precision if we were able to detect other wavelengths of light far more wavelengths could be plotted on figure 4 and different other emission series used thereby reducing the uncertainty in the value of r ∞ and giving a more accurate value,extended,bal
24,GS_LUU804_Redacted,the value of the rydberg constant was measured using observations of the emissions of a hydrogen lamp made using a grating spectrometer with a diffraction grating of 300 lines/mm the value found was 1.095 × 10 8 ± 3 × 10 5 which has 0.21 difference from the commonly accepted value the rydberg constant was measured through observing the wavelengths of beams of light emitted from a hydrogen lamp in order to measure these wavelengths a gatig spectrometer was used the rydberg constant r ∞ m −1 is used in spectroscopy to determine the wavelengths of light emitted when electrons move between the shells of an atom for example a hydrogen atom it was first determined by johannes rydberg in 1890 through investigation of the emission spectra of alkali metals 1 it is beneficial to measure the value of this constant precisely as it can be expressed in terms of several other more fundamental constants as where α is the fine structure constant dimensionless m e the electron mass kg c the speed of light m/s and h plank 's constant kg m 2 s −1 and due to this relation strict confines on the value of r ∞ can be used to restrict the values of these other harder-to-measure constants we chose to measure this constant to this end though it is unsure whether our result will have any significance due to the high level of precision already present in other measurements of this constant 4 a grating spectrometer deflects beams of light through diffraction a diffraction grating a piece of transparent material wit several thinly spaced parallel lines drawn upon it acting as a series of slits is at the heart of the spectrometer this grating deflects each beam a different angle θ dependent on it 's wavelength equation 3 and causes each beam to split into several which periodically repeat with different values of θ. these repetitions are distinguished through giving them a numeric identifier their order m which signifies their position the undeflected central beam is given an order 0 those either side 1 and -1 those beyond 2 and -2 etc these repeated beams can be observed through the movable eyepiece attached to the spectrometer and their angle relative to the central beam measured the wavelengths λ m of photons emitted by an excited hydrogen atom are given by the formula where n and p are dimensionless integers and represent the energy states of the atom before and after the emission of the photon considering a grating spectrometer as a series of narrow slits with slit seperation d m for light of wavelength λ m a maximum occurs when the phase difference ∆φ ∆φ m2π 2 where m is any integer the phase difference between rays from the grating can be shown to be equal to where ∆l is the difference in length of the paths each ray took hence and ∆l mλ as ∆l can also be defined as where θ is the angle between the normal and the maximum being considered it can be shown that in this case m is defined as the order of the considered beam thus by measuring the gradient of a plot of sin θ against m a value for λ could be found the grating spectrometer was set up so that the position of an undeflected beam of order 0 was measured as θ 0. this setup was performed using a sodium lamp as the spectrometer 's source as the hydrogen lamp could not be left on for extended periods of time the hydrogen lamp was then put into place and the measurements made each measurement was made through the initial identification of a beam through scanning with the eyepiece detailed adjustments of the position of the eyepiece were then made until the identified beam was centered in the eyepiece 's crosshairs the positioning was then checked by another party before the position was locked then the hydrogen lamp was switched off and the scale of the spectrometer read twice and the result recorded the colour of the beam as observed through the eyepiece was also recorded as a rudimentary measure to identify repeated beams of the same wavelengths then the lamp was switched back on and the process repeated this process as repeated until all observed beams were accounted for tables 1 2 and 3 show the results obtained from the experiment figure 2 shows a plot of these results the errors in these results were due to myself and my partners lack of confidence in our 2. ability to precisely read the vernier scale of the spectrometer as well as the size of the divisions on this scale thus the errors are the same for each result using these values we plotted a graph of sin θ against m for each colour of beam figure 2 from this plot and equation 7 we were able to determine values for the wavelength of each colour beam and use those values to estimate r ∞ the results of these calculations are shown in table 4. the values we chose for p and n were based on considerations of the known emission lines of hydrogen and estimations of which lines we were observing informed by data within source 2 these estimates were then averaged to produce our final value for r ∞ the true value of r ∞ is known to be r ∞ 1.097 373 156 850 8 × 10 8 ± 5.9 × 10 −12 3 our value is accurate to this one with a 0.21 difference with a percentage error of 0.27 our largest source of error in our measurements was the values calculated from the purple beams which may be due to the fact that they were fainter than the other beams and so harder to accurately measure the position of in this experiment we aimed to determine the rydberg constant with a high degree of accuracy the value we found was within 0.2 of the known value which considering the time and material constraints upon this experiment we believe to satisfy our aim this error could have been reduced by the provision of some kind of aid in finding the positions of spectral lines perhaps a more luminous hydrogen lamp or by using a sensitive camera connected to a computer enabling a quantitative judgment of the position of each line this would 've enabled the fainter purple spectral lines to be more precisely located and perhaps allowed the taking of measurements of the positions of more orders of the red and blue spectral lines 6

25,GS_GQR325_Redacted,"rydberg constant r ∞ which only discovered around a hundred years ago is a very important constant in physics it represents the limiting value of the highest wavenumber the inverse wavelength of any photon that can be emitted from the hydrogen atom the spectrum of hydrogen can be expressed simply in terms of the rydberg constant using the rydberg formula this experiment using spectrometer to measures the spectrum of the hydrogen and deduce the value of rydberg constant our result of rydberg constant is 10700000±𝟗𝟗𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎𝒎 𝟏 which contains the predict value 10973731.6. the random and systematic errors are mentioned in this report and improvements are discussed iffraction grating plays an important role in modern spectrometry it can be used to determine the composing elements by analyzing the reflected light the spectrum of hydrogen a typically linear spectrum is one of the most important foundation of quantum physics and it can be expressed by rydberg formula rydberg constant was first arising as a fitting parameter in the rydberg formula 1 𝜆 𝑅 1 𝑛 1 𝑝 where 𝑛 and 𝑝 are integers and 𝑅 is the rydberg constant rydberg formula describes the wavelength of spectral lines of many chemical elements the experiment is designed to measure the spectrum of hydrogen and deduce the value of rydberg constant by using spectrometer the reason we use diffraction grating to measure the spectrum is that we can take more measurements and easy to operate in this experiment we tried to make the make the measurements as precise as possible to make the range of results cover the current value of rydberg constant 10973731.6 𝑚 2 when electrons in the hydrogen atom were heated the energy gained push the electrons jump to higher energy levels after electrons leave the excited state energy is emitted as photon according to the formula e hν where e is the energy of photon ν is frequency of light emitted and h is the planck 's constant only certain colour appear in the spectrum means that only some certain energy of photon can be emitted these certain energies are the energy difference between energy levels shown in fig 1 if a light from hydrogen lamp with wavelength λ pass through the grating with n equally spaced very narrow slits and slit separation d a principal maximum will occur when the phase difference between neighboring rays is an integer multiple m of 2π phase difference 2πm the path difference is dsinθ so this equation which called the grating equation describes the relationship between the grating spacing and the angles of the incident and diffracted beams of light by measuring the θ as a function of order m 𝜆 can be calculated in the spectrometer based on rydberg formula when p 2 and n 3,4,5… which means that the atom is dropping down from nth energy level to the second energy level the equation is called balmer series the figure below fig 1 shows two balmer transitions in a hydrogen atom in the case n=3 and 4. the first thing we did is setting up the equipment according to fig 2 the eyepiece was focused on the cross wire and camera was also adjusted to make a 5 to 10 metres object is focused on the cross wire which means no parallax between the image and the cross wire the telescope was set up to be aligned with the axis of the collimator the hydrogen lamp was positioned close to the slit to make it illuminated then we adjust the focus of the collimator until a sharp image of the slit is focused at the cross wire the telescope was turned to exactly 90 deg and clamped in position before putting a grating in the holder and getting the rulings approximately vertical the grating table was turned until a reflected image of the entrance slit was seen in the eyepiece after that the grating table was rotated through precisely 45 deg using the scales to make it at 0 deg incidence next we moved the telescope around to look for the diffracted image of the slitchoosing one at a large angle of diffraction 1 fig 2 the spectrometer used in the experiment light from the hydrogen lamp goes through the slit and become parallel after passing the collimator it strikes the grating perpendicularly and is focused by the camera lens onto the cross-hair `` × '' the image is viewed by using the eyepiece the minimum scale of vernier is sixtieths of a degree so the uncertainty of the measurements of angle is ± 2 2.l deg before measuring the spectrum we did simple calculation to predict the colour of light expected we made n= 3,4,5 and p= 2 in the equation 1 𝑝 then we knew that the wavelength should be around 654 485 433 and 409 nm which are red blue and violet light respectively by twisting the telescope red orange and green lines were observed however we did not expect the orange and green lights we realized that green light should be the blue light and the orange light should be ignored during the measurements we found that it is very difficult to tell the reading on the vernier scale because the numbers on it are very small and using magnifying glass caused big uncertainty in addition the spectral line has width increase the uncertainty to find the middle of the line we decided to take measurements of each edge of line and fine the middle line and independently and compare our readings to determine the uncertainty the difference between our readings for each set of data plus ± 2 2.l deg the uncertainty of the vernier scale is our uncertainty of angle measurements table 1 shows 11 sets of angles and corresponding orders for the red lines a graph is obtained from

of the wave length of red light is 1.139×10 o × 2 st.t ×10 o 1.45×10 t hence the wavelength of red light is 4.96×10 s ± 1.45×10 t m. from the research the green light the electron transition from 4 th to 2 nd energy level so the uncertainty of 𝑅 is as a result the rydberg constant for the green light is 10800000 ± 314000 𝑚 2 the mean value of rydberg constant is the percentage uncertainty of the rydberg constant is 8.3 which is quite small there are some main causes of the error in the experiments the spectrometer itself has errors such as the vernier scale is not evenly distributed and the telescope may not be aligned perfectly as well the lines of spectrum had width and the edges were not clear so we could not determine the angle precisely the eyes were not perpendicular to the plane of vernier scale also made the readings have uncertainty this experiment is designed to measure the spectrum of hydrogen and deduce the value of rydberg constant by using spectrometer to measure the wavelength in balmer series directly the angle is measured to obtain the wavelength of the lights by using diffraction then the rydberg constant is calculated from the rydberg formula only two wavelengths were measured in the experiment in the case n=3 and 4. our result of rydberg constant is 10700000±990000𝑚 2 which has a reasonable uncertainty around 8 this result contain the predict value of rydberg constant which is 10973731.6 𝑚 2 although this result is not bad but we still found many systematic and random errors in the experiment the main systemic error is that the spectral lines have width which made the reading not accurate relative motion between transition atom and detector and the sensitivity of the equipment may cause this problem in the experiment the appearance of unexpected belt of light caused by the unwanted light in the laboratory also make the experiment inaccurate put a cover over the spectrometer may solve this problem there are also some random errors in the experiment when we turned the telescope the pan of vernier scale may slide slightly as mentioned before eyes may be not perpendicular to the vernier scale which also cause the reading inaccurate during the observation we did not see the violet light because of lack of intensity of the hydrogen lamp in order to get the result of the violet light a higher energy hydrogen lamp should be used",superficial,exp
26,GS_YUK005_Redacted,in this experiment we use spectrometry techniques to find the value of the rydberg constant we first set up our spectrometer and we measure the spectrum of hydrogen by passing the light of a hydrogen lamb through a diffraction grating we then measure the scattering angle of some visible light then we could deduce the wavelength of these lights with the formula for interference with diffraction grating and use the equation for transition wavelengths in hydrogen to obtain 𝑹 ∞ 𝟏𝟎𝟖𝟏𝟒𝟎𝟎𝟎 ± 𝟓𝟏𝟎𝟎𝟎𝒎 −𝟏 his report discusses an experiment to obtain a value for the rydberg constant the rydberg constant relates energy level changes of an electron in a hydrogen atom to the wavelength of the light emitted as there are certain energy levels in the hydrogen atom the hydrogen atom can only emit electromagnetic radiation of certain wavelength thus the rydberg constant can relate energy emitted and energy level changes in a hydrogen atom in this experiment we are only investigating electromagnetic radiation that is within the visible spectrum for a hydrogen atom the visible light emitted will be in the balmer series which will simplify the whole experiment as shown in the theory part in this experiment we determine wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the hydrogen lamb by passing them through a diffraction grating thus ideas about interference through a grating need to be considered at bright fringes of a wavelength of electromagnetic radiation the phase difference is always an integer multiple of 2𝜋 while at a dark fringe the phase difference is always odd integer multiple of 𝜋. assuming the viewing distance of the observer is large enough the rays will be parallel and we can deduce that the path difference between 2 rays ∆𝑙 ∆𝑙 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 from diagram 1 below where d is the slit separation and 𝜃 is the angle of the 2 rays from the horizontal phase difference ∆𝜑 is related to path difference ∆𝑙 as suggested by the equation below where 𝜆 is the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation with the above equation we could deduce that the angle at which bright fringe appear is given by 𝑛𝜆 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 eq 2 where d is the slit separation we could use this equation to deduce the wavelength of visible light from the hydrogen lamb a hydrogen atom can only emit electromagnetic radiation of certain wavelength due to the fixed energy levels for electron in the atom wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation is determined by the transitions of the electron between these energy levels the transition wavelength is given by the formula below where 𝑅 ∞ is the rydberg constant 𝜆 is the transition wavelength n is the initial energy level and p is the final energy level in this experiment we are only observing the light within the visible spectrum and this reduces the difficulty to distinguish what electron jump correspond to which light as visible light is in the balmer series and this series correspond to wavelength caused by electron jump finding the rydberg constant with spectroscopy t 2 from nth energy level to the second energy level p=2 we start off by setting up the spectrometer as the diagram 2. we focus the camera lens onto a distant object without using grating and view it at the eyepiece to check there is no parallax between the image and the cross wire as parallax will cause huge error in our measurement we then use a sodium lamp instead of hydrogen as our light source because the hydrogen lamp may die if it opens for a long period we then find the angle at where the central maximum is finding this angle simplify the experiment as we can use the angle difference between the nth maxima and the central maximum to determine the wavelength using equation 2 we use the spectrometer set up as diagram 2 to measure angle where bright fringes appear for visible light 1 and 2. for both colors we take the angle at center of the bright fringes as the measurement and this causes uncertainty as it is impossible to determine the exact location of the center for each fringe we use the 78.8 lines per mm grating in this experiment as it produces pattern with reasonable separation between fringes and high number of fringes across the 180 degrees viewing angle we measure from -3th order to 2th order for each color as more data will reduce the random error of the result to reduce the error further me and my lab partner measure these angles independently with the location of bright fringes of color 1 and 2 we can plot sin∆𝜃 against n where ∆𝜃 is the angle difference between the angle measured and the angle where central maximum is and n is the order as sin∆𝜃 and n follow a linear relationship the slope of the graph will be 𝜆 𝑑 we could obtain the value of 𝜆 by measuring the slope of the graph we can use the value of 𝜆 in equation 3 as we already know p=2 for visible light and we assign value of n to color 1 and 2 by the method of trial and error we know we will find the correct values for n when the two values of 𝑅 ∞ calculated from the n values of color 1 and 2 are similar and close to the accepted value 10973731.6. with the correct value of n we could obtain the value of the rydberg constant by rearranging ∆𝜃 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒 n order ∆𝜃 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒 -3 6.17 -2 4.17 -1 2.17 0 0.17 1 -1.83 2 -3.83 the reference angle at the 0 th order bright fringe is 172°10′ ± 0.2° we could obtain the value of ∆𝜗 by the following equation where 𝜃 is the measurement from the spectrometer and 𝜃 𝑅𝐸𝐹 is the reference angle at the 0 th order bright fringe we estimate the random error of the measurement by taking measurements independently between lab partners and we find that there is around 0.2° difference for every measurement we made we think this error arise from the fact that it is impossible to locate the center of the bright fringes accurately as some of the fringes have low intensity and they are blurred this uncertainty propagates to ∆𝜃 all ∆𝜃 measurement will have a 0.4° uncertainty with the tables above we plot sin∆𝜃 against n as shown below in this graph the slope will be − 𝜆 𝑑 as i assign positive 𝑠𝑖𝑛∆𝜃 value for negative n. we can rearrange and obtain value for 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 using some computational line fitting techniques we can obtain the following values for 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 where 𝜆 1 =663±1 nm and 𝜆 2 442 ± 1 nm we can then deduce the value for the rydberg constant using equation 3 as we have made observations on two visible light we can reduce the random error for the result of rydberg constant by taking the average of values derived from the two wavelengths 𝑅 ∞ 10810000±50000 𝑚 −1 as we know 𝑅 ∞ only depend on wavelength when n is fixed from equation 3 we could work out that the following relationship with this equation we could obtain ℴ 𝑅 ∞ =50000 the aim of this experiment is to find the rydberg constant in this experiment we use a spectrometer with a grating to determine the wavelength of light emitted from a hydrogen lamb and we work out the rydberg constant using equation 3 i think we have obtained some reasonably good measurements in this experiment which lead to a very close result to the accepted value however we spend too much time refining our data and we lack the time to estimate systematic error of the experiment such as misalignment of the spectrometer and lamp position etc i think we could improve this experiment by making more estimation about systematic error after this experiment i become more experienced at using the spectrometer and gain more insight about how spectroscopy can be used in different fields

27,GS_BQD756_Redacted,can be considered accurate furthermore as the percentage uncertainty is very low 0.432 we can also say that there is a relatively high precision by this method the rydberg constant r∞ is hugely important in atomic physics and helps to relate transition wavelengths λt to the energy levels which the electron has transitioned from with the equation where n and p are integers which represent the initial and final states of the atom when the rydberg constant was first established it was done so empirically in order to make sense of the rydberg equation when applied to a hydrogen spectrum however it has since been shown that it can be calculated from more fundamental constants further validating the value this feature is also why the rydberg is so useful it is one of the most precisely known constants so it is very useful when utilized in equation 1 for instance using the rydberg equation transition wavelengths can be determined with a very low uncertainty to get such a precise value i have used a grating spectrometer a spectrometer essentially creates a collimated beam of light which is then dispersed using a 78.8 mm -1 diffraction grating the spectrum can then be observed using an eyepiece and angles can be recorded through a vernier scale as long as the spectrometer is correctly calibrated i would hope to achieve very precise results to do this i will have to take measures to reduce the uncertainty of human judgement in parts of the method this will be achieved by repeat readings from two or more people or by incorporating digital equipment into the method e.g cameras to read vernier scales ii theory spectroscopy is the study and analysis of a spectrum of light the grating spectrometer i have used uses the phenomena of diffraction to separate the collimated light beam into its spectrum this occurs as the individual wavelengths of light which sum together to form the beam diffract by different amounts the angle of diffraction θ can be linked to the wavelength λ by the equation where n is the order of the maxima and d is the spacing between each slit in the diffraction grating we used a slit spacing of 1.269x10 -5 m as this produced good spectral patterns for analysis maxima appear during diffraction due to the superposition of wave fronts at a maximum the path difference between the two waves must be an integer number of wavelengths determining the rydberg constant using a grating spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk as previously mentioned and shown by equation 1 the rydberg constant demonstrates the wavelength of the photon which is emitted/absorbed when there is a change in energy within the atom this due to the discrete energy levels which exist within an atom and is explained using the bohr model of the atom figure 1 shows some of the more common transitions within the hydrogen atom the balmer series in hydrogen are the transitions which result in visible photon wavelengths contrastingly the lyman series exist in the ultraviolet range and the paschen series in the infrared range bohr also helped to show the rydberg constant can not just be found empirically but can also be expressed using fundamental constants by where α is the fine structure constant me is the mass of an electron c is the speed of light and h is planck 's constant 4 by substituting in the equation for the fine structure constant we have an even more fundamental equation with where e is the charge of an electron and εo is the permittivity of free space iii method to carry out precise measurements it is imperative that the grating spectrometer is correctly calibrated the spectrometer must be in focus and free of parallax so we focused the eyepiece onto the cross hair which is in the middle of the telescope and we could then focus the camera lens onto an image at approximately ten metres away so that the parallel light rays would be in focus when they pass through the camera lens at this point it is important that the lamp is ready to be used and must be placed as closely to the slit as possible whilst being completely on view to the slit this is so that the only light coming through the eyepiece is from the lamp with the maximum intensity available we ensured the camera collimator and eyepiece were parallel and we changed the focus of the collimator so that the slit gap was in focus in the eyepiece from this point it was important that we did not change the focus on any part of the spectrometer as we would then have to repeat the entire process we then placed the diffraction grating in to its holder making sure we did not touch the surface and that it was completely vertical we used 78.8mm -1 diffraction grating with this value being determined by the manufacturer from this point we rotated the telescope 90° secured in into position with a screw and proceeded to rotate the grating until the entrance of the slit was reflected into the eyepiece approximately 45° we did not need to adjust the height of the image as it was in a good position however we could have done this by using the plate screws if required we recorded the angle on the vernier scale and continued to rotate the grating through exactly 45° so that the plate was at a 0° incidence we were now happy that the spectrometer was calibrated however we moved the telescope around to observe some of the spectral lines to confirm that they were being shown and were vertical when calibrated correctly and with enough repeats the spectrometer will produce uncertainties of approximately ±0.2nm in order to reduce the effect of human judgement increasing this uncertainty we placed the camera from a smart phone in a set position to take pictures of the vernier scale when an angle needs to be measured this reduces uncertainty as it stops the error in reading from an arcminute scale the uncertainty from reading off the scale was reduced from ±1/12° to approximately ±1/120° a sodium lamp was used to collect some preliminary data during the prelimina1y investigation the optimal size of the slit spacing was dete1mined which would remain constant throughout the experiment and we also decided that the 78.smm-1 was the grating which produced the clearest patterns so that would also remain constant throughout the experiment we replaced the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp and began to record data as seen from the balmer series there are 4 main transitions which result in visible photons and we will observe 3 transitions and take angle measurements for each we are observing red blue and purple bands for each colour band we observed the zero order and recorded the next two maximums on the positive and negative side we would record the order with its corresponding angle from the vernier scale when taking these readings there is an uncertainty in the width of the band that you are observing to minimize this unce1iainty we each took a reading from both edges of the band and took an average to get a better estimate of where the centre of the band is to finiher decrease the unce1iainty we then took take an average of our own individual measurements using equation 2 we could plot a graph of sin0 as a function of the order of the maximum in this case 0 is the angle from the zero-order maximum this gave us a precise estimate of the wavelength of each transition we then used equation 1 to plot the transition wavelengths against the transition energy levels to detennine the rydberg constant when taking measurements for 0 it is very imp01iant that there are no background sources of light so the experiment was canied out in a blacked-out room with small desk lamps background light could interfere with the spectrums and reduce the intensity of the spectrums in the eyepiece this would increase the unce1iainty in our measurements other factors which must also remain constant am the humidity and air pressure in the environment ignoring negligible fluctuations these were involunta1ily kept constant moreover during the experiment we encountered an issue with the hydrogen lamps they can only be used for time spans of around fifteen minutes before they overheat and stop working we had one hydrogen lamp break when we were near the end of the experiment despite being the same model from the same manufacturer we still expected to have different results from the new lamp this could be taken as a major source of error to dete1mine the rydberg constant we first had to have accurate estimates of the transition wavelengths of the emission bands we were observing from figure 3 you can see that each band follows a linear relationship which passes through the origin the gradient at each point is equivalent to the transmission wavelength divided by the slit spacing using this data we computed the wavelength of each band the wavelength of the red band was 622.6 ± 0.7 nm the blue band was 493.3 ± 0.6 nm and the purple band had a wavelength of 444.0 ± 0.9 mn when compru ed to the balmer series these wavelengths agreed with the actual transition wavelengths so they can be considered accurnte the main enors that arose in the wavelengths are the enors from measuring the diffraction angle of each band which manifested itself in the values of sin0 the calibration of the spectrnmeter was a cause of systematic error even tl1ough the spectrometer was calibrated carefully it was largely done by eye so we can expect a small yet non-negligible constant enor throughout the results i estimated this to be approximately ±0.3nm another major source of systematic euor is the changing of the hydrogen lamp midway through our experiment as previously mentioned the model was the same however they can not be expected to perf01m in the same way i took this to be a systematic enor which is only prevalent in the data recorded after the change from when the lamp changed the relationship still seemed to follow a consistent b'end with no real signs of fluctuation fmthe1more as the lamps are the same model and were manufactured at a similar time i have taken tl1e e1rnr to be negligible random enors have also been considered despite reading from a camera there is still random enor in reading from the vernier scale i approximated this to be ±0.18nm by observing the smallest change of angle which could be dete1mined and using equation 2 to check the change in wavelength additionally background sources of light did become a sligl1t issue and we did find slight drops in intensity at points which created more unce1iainty when taking readings when this occuned we ensmed that the background light was removed and we remeasured the values to get an eitor from a measurement of wavelength we added the eitors in quadrature to get a set eitor of ±0.35nm for every measurement this then had to be added in quadrature to the enor which occmted due to the width of the band of light this was the individual main somce of eitor and it accounted on average to 50 of each eitor on the wavelength on figme 3 there are no euor bars shown as they are so small that they affected the clarity of the data points therefore i removed them we then analysed the wavelengths of the emission bands using equation 1 the gradient of the graph shown in figme 3 is equal to the rydberg constant using the gradients and tl1e eitors which have been estimated practically the value of the rydberg constant is 1094599 ± 15872 m• 1 this shows a percentage uncertainty of 0.145 and a percentage euor from the actual rydberg constant 10973739.6m-1 of 0.253 this means that the actual value of the rydberg constant does not lie in the range of nnceitainty these enors are somced from the e1rnrs in the reciprocal of the wavelength as there are no eitors in the x direction on figme 3. the e1tors here are equivalent to the percentage enors from dete1mining the wavelengths for confumation i analysed the graph in figure 3 statistically using a co-variance matrix function which can be found in the scipy module in python this resulted in a rydberg constant of 1094599 ± 47287 m• 1 from tlus there is now a 0.432 uncertainty so the actual value does now lie in the range of unce1iainty this shows that the statistical variation is indeed greater than the practical unceitainties that i estimated so i chose to use the statistical unce1tainty in my final value due to this we can say that the experiment was more accurate than initially thought as the expected value is in the coitect range from my experimental value contrnstingly the experiment was not as precise as initially calculated because the percentage uncertainty did in fact increase when statistical methods were used this is caused by the random enor in estimating the centre of the enussion band because it was accountable for over 50 of the total enor when the wavelengths were computed it is the largest source of eitor so it has the most affect when added in quadratm•e v. conclusion the goal of the experiment was to determine a precise and accurate measurement of the rydberg constant we were observing the spectrum from a hydrogen lamp to identify and analyse the balmer series to compute the rydberg constant from it a grating spectrometer was used to diffract the collimated light beam and the angle of diffraction of the maxima were analysed my final value of the rydberg constant was 1094599 ± 47287 m -1 which results in a 0.253 error from the true value with our equipment and skill level i believe we made an accurate and very precise measurement of the rydberg constant this is due to the percentage uncertainty and our error being very small considering human judgement was required in the experiment you can usually rely on human error being in the 2-3 area 5 at least whereas our error was 10 times smaller than this expected value due to this our value can be considered accurate in order to improve this experiment i would consider a more modern approach to the grating spectrometer a spectrometer which can be programmed to optimise itself in terms of grating type and slit sizes and can identify where maxima exactly lie this would virtually remove all random error from the method making the experimental value much more precise,expert,bal
28,GS_SRW902_Redacted,the wavelength of visible light emitted from the balmer series of hydrogen can be used to determine the rydberg constant using a hydrogen lamp and a transmission diffraction grating of 300 lines per millimetre the wavelength of red and blue light was measured these wavelengths gave two estimates of the rydberg constant lying either side of the true value a weighted average of these based on the uncertainty of each measurement gave a value of r∞ 1.10±0.01 ×10 7 m −1 the result obtained using a student pasco model sp-9268 spectrometer varies from the universally accepted value of r∞ 10 973 731.568508 ± 0.000065 m −1 by 0.24 the experiment shows that relatively precise measurements of the rydberg constant can be made using a spectrometer from an undergraduate laboratory provided the hydrogen emission lines can be clearly observed t he rydberg constant is used to calculate the wavelength of a photon of light emitted during its transition from an excited energy state to a lower one measurement of the rydberg constant to great precision has allowed atomic physicists to understand the chemical composition of stars and the structure of the atom the relationship between many fundamental physical constants used by atomic physicists can be described by the rydberg constant defined by where µ 0 is the permeability of free space m e is the rest mass of an electron e is the fundamental electronic charge c is the speed of light in a vacuum and h is the planck constant all in si units 1 using a pasco model sp-9268 student spectrometer 2 common in most undergraduate physics laboratories the rydberg constant was calculated to within 0.24 of the accepted value 3 consideration of systematic error was vital in this experiment and is the limiting factor in the accuracy of the measurement by reducing the systematic errors as much as possible a measurement of r ∞ to within less than 0.5 is comfortably achievable with this spectrometer in 1913 niels bohr postulated that an electron can move in stable approximately circular orbits without emitting radiation or losing energy 4 the energy of a photon e photon as radiation light is emitted is given by where e i and e f denote the initial and final energy of the photon as it emits radiation and falls to a lower energy level the final energy level that the photon falls to determines what spectral series is observed during this experiment the wavelength of light due to electron transitions in hydrogen atoms was measured from a high energy level to the second level n 2 if each energy level is labeled n 1 n 2 n 3 and so on then the electron transitions for a hydrogen atom are called the lyman series 5 n 1 the balmer series 6 n 2 the paschen series 6 n 3 and the brackett series 7 n 4 these transitions are shown in fig 1 transitions to higher energy levels have also been observed though the spectral lines become fainter as the likelihood of a transition to an energy level greater than n 6 is quite uncommon electron transitions in the balmer series that fall to n 2 emit radiation in the visible spectrum using a hydrogen lamp and the spectrometer the wavelength of light emitted from the lamp was determined as equation 2 states the energy of a photon emitted from an electron during its transition between two energy levels is the difference in energy between those two levels if we compare the relative mass of a proton 8 m proton 1.67 × 10 −27 kg to that of an electron 9 m e 9.11×10 −31 kg then it a reasonable assumption that m proton m e the mass of a proton is ≈ 1840 times that of an electron using this assumption and bohr 's postulate we can equate the electrical force f e and the centripetal force f c acting on an electron where 0 is the permittivity of free space r n is the orbital radius around the n th shell and v n is the speed of the electron 's orbit all in si units all other symbols carry the same meaning as defined in equation 1 these two forces can be equated since the electron and proton have opposite charges with the electron orbiting the proton and the assumption that no other forces act the radius of the electron 's orbit and its speed are given by and respectively bohr further postulated that 'the angular momentum of the electron round the nucleus in a stationary state of the system is equal to an entire multiple of a universal value independent of the charge on the nucleus 4 in fig 2 the electron can be seen in yellow emitting radiation as it transitions from n 3 to n 2 this is a balmer series spectral line and occurs in the visible spectrum bohr went on to show that the angular momentum of an electron is a quantised integer multiple of h 2π 4 we can therefore write where n ∈ z now rewriting the expressions for r n and v n as and equating to equations 4 and 5 respectively we find that and for a hydrogen atom in its ground state the most likely position of the electron occurs at n 1. this is known as the bohr radius r bohr 10 applying the principle of conservation of energy allows the sum of the kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p to be written as a constant e t conservation of energy tells us that substituting the expressions for r n and v n from equations 9 and 10 into equation 11 using the familiar and yields the energy of radiation emitted as an electron falls from its initial excited energy state n i to a lower final state n f given by equation 2 can be expressed as the speed of light c wavelength of light λ and frequency f are related by for light traveling in a vacuum using the planck-einstein relation 11 that the energy of an emitted photon of light is related to its frequency by where h is the planck constant equation 15 can be rearranged 12 to where r ∞ m e e 4 8 0 2 ch 3 m −1 19 to determine a value for the rydberg constant the wavelength of light along with its uncertainty was measured during the experiment electron transitions of the balmer series were observed in particular transitions from n 3 to n 2 and from n 4 to n 2 using equation 18 and the value of r ∞ quoted in the laboratory manual 13 r ∞ 10 973 731.6m −1 wavelengths of λ red 656nm and λ blue 486nm should correspond to these two transitions respectively these wavelength values were calculated using the currently accepted value of r ∞ so that the two colours of light red and blue were known before starting the experimental work when a wave of wavelength λ passes through a small slit the wave is diffracted and spreads out in a circular path if there are multiple slits of separation distance d such as on a diffraction grating then lots of circular wavefronts are formed as the wave diffracts through numerous slits these wavefronts interfere resulting in constructive and destructive interference for constructive interference two waves must superpose at a maximum so they are in-phase the path difference between two adjacent slits is λ and so a righttriangle can be constructed as in fig 3 such that due to the sinusoidal nature of waves successive minima and maxima will occur as the wavefronts progress maxima are observed for any integer number of λ though the intensity of successive maxima will decrease as the diffraction increases we find therefore that where m ∈ z and is called the order number a student pasco model sp-9268 spectrometer 2 was used to calculate the wavelength of red and blue light emitted from a hydrogen lamp as excited electrons transition from n 4 and n 3 to the second energy level n 2 equation 21 was used to measure the angle θ at which maxima were observed for order numbers m ±1 ±2 and ±3 further order numbers were not visible as the intensity of light at m ≥ 4 was too low to record accurate measurements a graph of sin θ against order number m was plotted for the red and blue light values of λ red and λ blue were then calculated by where d the number of slits per unit length was known values of r ∞ with their associated error were then calculated from equation 18 ensuring that the telescope was clearly focused so that well defined lines of interference could be observed the hydrogen lamp was placed near the collimator slit the width of the slit was adjusted until the red and blue lines were clearly visible and focused the direction of travel of the light is shown by black arrows in fig 4 a transmission diffraction grating of 300 lines per millimetre was used to cause diffraction of the light and for the wavelength to be measured 21 allows for the wavelength to then be calculated adapted from 11 a labeled set-up of the apparatus used in the experiment is shown in fig 5 the telescope was firstly focused on a distant object at the other side of the laboratory minor adjustments to the lens were made to ensure that it was exactly in focus using the focus knob on the top of the telescope for the initial set-up of the apparatus a sodium lamp was used to align the lens this was to eliminate the risk of the hydrogen lamp overheating the sodium lamp was placed very close to the collimator slit and the power supply was switched on the telescope was pointed at the slit and a sharp focused image of the light was observed the angle of rotation of the telescope was noted from the vernier scale at this point it was then rotated through 90 • a mirror was placed in the grating holder and the grating table was rotated through 45 • so that the slit was reflected and visible from the telescope 's eyepiece the telescope was then returned to its original position and a diffraction grating of 300 lines per millimetre was inserted into the grating holder at this point well defined blue and red slits could be seen through the eyepiece to improve the accuracy of measurement fig 5 a labeled image of the experimental set up most parts of the spectrometer are visible on the image though a few can not be seen the slit adjustment is located to the left of the collimator focus knob and is used to narrow or widen the slit of light from the lamp at the end of the telescope not visible is the eyepiece with cross-hair alignment the cross-hairs can be rotated and were positioned in such a way to produce an x shape as opposed to a '+ on the underside of the telescope is an adjustment knob used to make small alterations to the focus of the telescope when reading numerical values from the vernier scale a hand held magnifying glass was used to reduce the likelihood of misreading the scale occasionally using the magnifying glass was not very effective if for example the table rotation handle aligned exactly over the vernier scales in such situations a mobile phone camera was used to capture the scale at an appropriate zoom to reduce the possibility of random error one person took all the readings from the vernier scale whilst the other controlled the alignment of the telescope a parallax error also had to be considered when taking readings from the vernier scale this error was minimised by positioning the magnifying glass/mobile phone directly above the scale and taking readings from this position the resolution of the vernier scale on this grating spectrometer was 1arcminute and so an error of ±1arcminute when reading the scale is reasonable it would not be justified to claim an error of ±0.5arcminutes due to the parallax error which can not entirely be ignored when rotating the telescope to the position of each spectral emission line the physical thickness of these lines had to be considered since each diffracted beam has a physical width over which the wavelength of light remains the same the beam was measured in two places the angle of rotation of the telescope for each spectral line was measured on the left side and the right side of the beam denoted by θ lef t and θ right respectively the crosses in fig 6 show where the telescope was aligned to take these readings the error associated with the width of each beam was added in quadrature to the error from reading the vernier scale the error for the width of the fig 6 a graphic of a diffracted beam of blue light being observed through the telescope the telescope 's angle of rotation is recorded at the two x 's and the mean of the two values taken readings of θ lef t and θ right have an uncertainty of ±1arcminute though the width of the beam is significantly larger than this beam was given by and varied for each beam the variation was likely due to the increasing faintness of higher order beams and the uncontrollable background light due to other groups in the laboratory in general the width of the beam appeared to increase as the order number increased in magnitude this was likely due to the greater diffraction and decrease in intensity of the light where more background light was present the beams became more difficult to accurately observe this is reflected in the individual errors associated with each of the beams also notable is the larger width error for the measurements of blue light compared to red for almost all the measurements the blue beams appeared fainter and with more faded edges making the exact position of θ lef t and θ right harder to decipher fig 7 shows the variation in beam width for red and blue light for order numbers −2 ≤ m ≤ 2. these values are all much greater than the ±1arcminute error due to reading the vernier scale and so dominate when added in quadrature there is little correlation in the data though the errors for blue light are consistently higher than that for red light except for one reading when plotting sin θ against m to determine the wavelength of the red and blue light the mean value was used this method was used to determine the position of each beam since aligning the cross-hairs with the centre of the slits is much more subjective and introduces a greater random error placing the cross-hair exactly on the boundary of the slit results in less random error and tells us the width of the beam when the angle at both sides is measured fig 7 a graph of the width of the diffracted red and blue beams using a diffraction grating of 300 lines per millimetre coloured accordingly over five order numbers from equation 21 a plot of sin θ against order number m will yield a straight line of gradient λ d two diffraction gratings were available during this experiment one with 80 lines per millimetre the other with 300 lines per millimetre preliminary experimental data showed that using the grating with 300 lines per millimetre was much more beneficial for this experiment the sharpness and clarity of the diffracted beams increased as the number of slits per unit length increased this meant that it was easier to align the telescope with the left and right side of each beam since the sides were more defined the spacing between each beam was on average ≈ 9 • when using the 300line grating compared to ≈ 22 • apart for the 80-line grating a consequence of this spacing was the number of diffracted beams that could be observed beams of order m 2 were not at all visible when the 80-line grating was used however when using the 300-line grating third order beams were visible for red light a θ widtherror of around 25arcminutes was measured for the beams when using the 80-line grating during the experiment only the 300-line grating was used to produce the diffracted beams this kept the θ widtherror to a minimum and allowed for the maximum number of diffracted beams to be observed and their position measured 21 and contains error bars for the angle measured at each diffracted beam there is no error along the horizontal axis since the order number was unambiguous and could clearly be counted from starting at the zeroth order beam the zeroth order beam was identified as being a different colour to all the other beams its position was such that the red and blue light appeared in the same place and so a purple colour beam was seen errors along the vertical axis are dependent upon the varying error θ widtherror defined by equation 23 as well as the constant error of ±1arcminute due to taking readings from the vernier scale the red line of the graph represents the plot of red light and the blue line represents blue light a red diffracted beam of order m −3 could be observed through the telescope though blue light of this order could not be the intensity of the red diffracted beams appeared greater than that of the blue light and perhaps explains why red light of this order could be seen but blue not though this is purely speculative fig 8 a graph of sin θ against order number m for red and blue light using a diffraction grating of 300 lines per millimetre the red line represents the data collected from measurements of red light and the blue line represents the blue light data the dimensionless gradient of the red line is 0.195 ± 0.002 and the gradient of the blue line is 0.16 ± 0.02. from the gradient of the two lines shown in fig 8 the wavelengths of red and blue light were calculated using equation 22 where d 1 3×10 5 m they were found to be λ red 650 ± 7nm and λ blue 530 ± 70nm the large error in λ blue is predominantly due to the uncertainty in the width of the diffracted beams and is previously discussed in detail using equation 18 two values of the rydberg constant can be calculated using the values and uncertainty of λ red and λ blue these are r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 using the measured wavelength of red light and r ∞ 1.0 ± 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 using the wavelength of blue light these values vary from the accepted value of r ∞ by 1.1 and 9.7 respectively as shown in fig 8 the relative error due to the width of each beam was much larger than the ±1arcminute error due to reading the vernier scale this was the main cause of uncertainty during the experiment spectrometer misalignment could have introduced a systematic error into the experiment though the risk of this was greatly reduced by practising the alignment multiple times before taking measurements the spectrometer was set-up in a well-lit room on a sturdy grating table shown in fig 5 the likelihood of misalignment is low so it is a reasonable assumption to treat this error as negligible in comparison to other sources a significant source of error that is reflected in the error bars of fig 8 was the positioning of the hydrogen lamp the lamp was positioned as close to the collimator slit as possible to ensure that the greatest intensity of light could be observed through the telescope during preliminary testing the lamp was placed at a distance 20 ± 1 cm away from the collimator slit and the diffracted beams observed the beams were noticeably fainter and their boundaries not as well defined this resulted in a much larger θ widtherror and so the lamp was placed as close to the collimator slit as possible during the experiment for measurements of the blue diffracted beams the θ widtherror was generally larger than the measurements for red light this may be due to the positioning of the lamp since it was moved between readings of the red and blue diffracted beams it is possible that the hydrogen lamp was placed slightly off centre and so the boundaries of the beams for the blue light were less well defined this possible mispositioning could also explain why no third order blue beams could be seen since the intensity of light able to pass through the collimator slit was less this systematic error affects the uncertainty in the telescope 's angle θ when measuring each of the beams and so is accounted for in the vertical error bars of fig 8 considering the average difference in the error θ widtherror for the red and blue light the mispositioning of the lamp likely increased the error in the blue light data by ≈ 6arcminutes due to the mispositioning the distance of the hydrogen lamp from the collimator slit was greater for the measurements of the blue light compared to red when the hydrogen lamp is placed away from the collimator slit not only light from the lamp enters through the slit background light played a part in the uncertainty of the boundary of each of the beams and so this source of error was amplified by the mispositioning of the lamp when measuring the blue wavelength during the experiment the laboratory lights were switched off though desk lights were turned on this resulted in some light pollution to minimise the effect of this background light the spectrometer and lamp were covered by a coat when readings were being taken although this eliminated most of the background light not all of it was blocked since the result of the background light was an increased uncertainty in the exact boundary of the diffracted beams this error is again reflected in the vertical error bars of fig 8 and accounts for an error of ≈ 4arcminutes for all the readings though inevitably varies for each reading defocus of the telescope could have introduced a small systematic error in the measurements as previously mentioned the spectrometer was set-up multiple times before data was collected and the telescope focused onto a small blue box at the other side of the laboratory since the images of the beams remained the same clarity throughout the experiment it is a reasonable assumption to treat this systematic error as negligible considering the relative uncertainties of the experimental values for the rydberg constant a weighted average of the two can be established the value of r ∞ calculated from λ red has an error ten times smaller that than of the value calculated from λ blue using this weighting we find r ∞ 10 1.11×10 7 +1.0×10 7 11 ± 10 0.01×10 7 +0.1×10 7 which yields a final weighted value of the constant r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 this result lies 0.24 from the accepted value and encompasses the accepted value within the error given measuring the wavelength of red and blue light from their emission lines in the balmer series from a hydrogen lamp allowed for two values of the rydberg constant to be calculated these were r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 using the measured wavelength of red light and r ∞ 1.0 ± 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 using the wavelength of blue light the values lie either side of the accepted value and combined gave a weighted experimental average of the rydberg constant as r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 effective use of the student pasco model sp-9268 spectrometer to measure the wavelengths of light enabled a final value of the rydberg constant to be calculated to within 0.24 of the accepted value careful consideration of errors and their propagation was crucial in ensuring that an accurate result could be calculated the techniques used to minimise errors such as practising the set-up and alignment of the spectrometer covering the apparatus to block out background light and positioning the hydrogen lamp such that the intensity of the diffracted beams was as large as possible were successful in keeping the errors relativity low poor experimental technique when measuring the wavelength of blue light led to a large random error the misalignment of the hydrogen lamp and collimator slit resulted in an increase in background light and consequently a decrease in intensity of the diffracted beams both consequently increased the overall uncertainty in the width of each beam and so the error was large to improve on the experimental technique used in this experiment more data should be taken across a range of diffraction gratings with more data the apparent background noise may be able to be separated and potentially completely removed from the error in the readings diffraction gratings with slit spacings 300 lines per millimetre may allow for higher order beams to be observed and hence the uncertainty of the gradient in,deep,bal
29,GS_GKW379_Redacted,"he rydberg constant is deduced by the relationship between the transition wavelength and the energy levels of the initial and final states of atom when there is an atom dropping down from an energy level to another a photon with a specific wavelength will be given off the wavelengths are observable hence they are in the visible spectrum to determine the wavelengths a diffraction grating can be use the relationship between path difference order number and diffraction angles then can be used to deduce the wavelength with the using of a standard color spectrum chart the rydberg constant can then be calculated the diffraction grating can be considered as a large number n of narrow slits with width d equally spaced from fig1.1 it can be shown that the path difference is dsinθ where θ is the angle of diffraction combining this with fig 2. it is shown that the principal maximum only occurs when the phase difference between neighbouring rays of light is a

in the visible spectrum with p=2 as shown on fig3.3 as the final state is always on the second energy level and n=3,4,5,6 as the initial state can be either of those 4 energy levels electrons dropping between energy levels will give off a photon with exact wavelength corresponding to the n and p values suppose an electron dropped from n=3 to p=2 it can be say that the electron will give off a photon with specific wavelength of 656nm fig 3. a representation of the energy level of electrons in hydrogen with only the balmer series laying in the range of the visible spectrum and hence observable to human eyes noted that the balmer series is given by p=2 and n=3,4,5,6 this is saying that electrons dropping from nth energy to the second p=2 energy level is given off a photon with the wavelength corresponding to the n value 3 iii method first is to set up the grating spectrometer simply focus the telescope to a distance object making sure the x seen through the telescope is very clear set up the hydrogen lamp and adjust the collimator so the x is on focus to the center of the strip of light through the slit adjust the angular scale and record the 'zero point for future references place a total reflective mirror on the grating plate rotate the telescope 90 degrees from the 'zero point and rotate the grating plate so that the reflection of light from the mirror shows the x at the center of the strip of light lock the grating plate and rotate 45 degrees back in the direction so that the collimator is parallel to the telescope and perpendicular to the grating plate with the diagram on the top showing single strips from the continuous visible spectrum below so through the spectrometer there will be brighter strips of color visible in the continuous spectrum form by the grating define the center with no diffraction as order number 1 moving to the left or right with increase integer numbers i.e m=1,2,3 etc 5 in order to calculate the transition wavelength measure the diffraction angle through the telescope relating to fig 5. rotate the telescope until the x is at the center of the brighter strips of light to record the angle repeat the process for different order numbers plot a graph of the sine of the diffraction angle against order number relating to equation 1 the transition wavelength can be found relating to the balmer series values of n can be determined and hence the value of the rydberg constant results 1 i have plotted graphs of sine of the diffraction angles against order number in python as the errors are relatively small it can not be see on the graph the gradient including the error calculated by python are shown below the error in gradient is converted into the error in the wavelength by using the relationship the error in the constant is calculated by combining the two results i get 𝑅 ⋈ 10900 ± 250 × 10 3 𝑚 −1 there can be improvement in determining the error in the diffraction angles by considering the width of the strip of light as it is difficult to get the x in the telescope exactly at the center it is worth measuring the angle of diffraction of the width at both the left and right boundary of the strips the resolution of the spectrometer can contribute greatly to a systematic error the error in the measuring instrument can be determine by doing a test when the maximum of one diffraction pattern occurs at the same position as the maximum of another pattern the grating spectrometer was an extremely accurate measuring apparatus allowing angle measurements precise as arcminutes by using the principles of the diffraction grating and the energy levels of hydrogen a quite accurate value of the rydberg constant was calculated the hydrogen lamp was quite easily over-heated resulting in the use of multiple different hydrogen lamps within the measuring process this potentially introduced more uncertainty and could be avoided with more care on the time of usage of the lamp the experiment could also be repeated several times in order to reduce the potential errors in the process of observing the diffraction pattern there were many external light sources coming from the background resulting in extra light strips being introduced this increased the chance of measuring the wrong light strip and could be reduced by covering the light source and blocking all the light coming into the telescope",superficial,bal
30,GS_MJV182_Redacted,this investigation involved the determination of rydberg 's constant by means of using a grating spectrometer to measure the angular displacement of diffracted spectral lines from a hydrogen lamp first calculating the wavelengths of these spectral lines and then using the values of these wavelengths to calculate values for the rydberg constant the determination by this method produced the accurate results of 1.10±0.04 ×10 7 m −1 1.09± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 thus it was concluded that the set of data from the red diffracted spectral lines produced the data with the least amount of experimental uncertainty when an electromagnetic emission is diffracted whether it be from distant star or a sodium lamp the various wavelengths of the emission are diffracted at different angles this therefore produces a spectra of all the wavelengths present in the emission where the spectra will be 'continuous for a solid emitter such as heated metal filaments -containing a continuum of wavelengths of varying intensities however in the case of electrons in heated or electrically excited gases the excitement and following relaxation of the electrons between the discrete energy levels of the gas atoms causes the spectra to contain only specific wavelengths -those that relate to the size of the discrete energy gaps that the electrons transition over this is given by λ hc e where λ is the wavelength h is planck 's constant c is the speed of light and e is size of the discrete energy gap these are called 'emission line spectra from the spectral pattern they produce when examined using a spectrometer a spectrometer produces this spectrum by collimating a thin sliver of light from the source using either a lens or mirror and then passing the re-sulting beam through either a grating to diffract it or a prism to refract it each wavelength in the beam will diffract or refract at a different angle thus producing a spectrum spectroscopy has been used for analysis in chemistry physics and astronomy all the way since the early 19th century when joseph von fraunhofer first used a diffraction grating to produce a spectrum of the sun 's visible light which appeared as a continuous spectrum with thin dark gaps in certain areas these were later determined to be certain elements in the sun 's corona absorbing discrete wavelengths of the sun 's radiation to excite their electrons to higher energy levels thus reducing the intensity of the sun 's light at these wavelengths -i.e the dark gaps this investigation uses a grating spectrometer the same concept as that originally developed by fraunhofer to measure the wavelengths of spectral lines in the balmer series emitted by a hydrogen lamp these can then be used to deduce the rydberg constant a fundamental constant which relates the the spectral lines of an emission spectrum to their wavelengths niels bohr in his hypothesis for the model of an atom defined the rydberg constant r ∞ in terms of various fundamental physical constants where m e is the mass of an electron c is the speed of light h is planck 's constant and α is the fine structure constant -which is itself a combination of other fundamental constants maxima of an interference pattern occur when the phase difference between two rays is an integer multiple m of 2π the phase difference can also be expressed as the path difference of the two rays multiplied by 2π λ where λ is the wavelength of the interfering rays 1 and since the path difference is just the slit separation d multiplied by sinθ where θ is the angle of diffraction thus eliminating 2π here it can be seen that sinθ is directly proportionate to m called the order number thus by measuring the angles that the maxima appear at and knowing the slit separation of the diffraction grating the wavelength of the refracted light can be determined the rydberg formula relates the transition wavelengths λ of hydrogen to the integers n and p which represent the discrete energy levels of the excited and relaxed states of the atom respectively the balmer series refers to the series of electron transitions from an excited energy state of n 3 4 5 • • • ∞ to a relaxed state of p 2. the rydberg constant can then be calculated using the balmer transition wavelength values determined using the grating spectrometer the following is a diagram of the path traveled by the light in the spectrometer the emission from the source is passed through a narrow slit where a collimator converts the light into a parallel beam after then passing through the grating at normal incidence part of the diffracted beam can be focused through a camera onto the center of a cross-hair x shape 1. the eyepiece lens was adjusted to focus on the cross hair then the camera focused on a distant object -to imitate parallel light 2. the telescope was then set to be aligned with the axis of the collimator 0 • of angular displacement and the hydrogen lamp positioned in front of the slit so as to illuminate it 3. the focus of the collimator was adjusted until the image of the slit on the cross hair was as sharp as possible and the telescope positioned so the slit was in alignment with the center of the cross hair 4. the grating was moved through precisely 90 • and the grating placed in the holder the grating table was turned until a reflected image of the slit was visible in the eyepiece -this indicates that the grating is at an angle of 45 • with the incident beam from the lamp and the telescope 5. the telescope was rotated through 45 • back to be in parallel with the incident beam on the grating 6. the angular displacements from this point to the diffracted spectral lines of red light were then recorded as a function of their order of magnitude the same was done for the sets of diffracted blue and violet spectral lines from the linear regression analysis of the slopes in figure 2 the standard errors in the gradient of the slope are 0.000225 0.0012 0.00271 for the red blue and violet spectral lines respectively these along with the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grating can be used to calculate the overall error in the value obtained for the rydberg constant here is an example calculation for the 'red lines set of data the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grating was taken as ±2 as stated by the manufacturer thus d slope slope 0.000225 0.0522 0.00431 6 therefore the value determined for the rydberg constant via the 'red line data is 1.10 ± 0.02 × 10 7 m −1 the same process applied to the 'blue and 'violet data sets gives rydberg constant values of 1.10 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 1.09 ± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 these results are notably accurate the calculated error in each obtained value accounts for the difference between the calculated value and the real known value of 1.097 × 10 7 for the 'red set of data the error in the diffraction grating turned out to be the most significant source of uncertainty whereas for the 'blue and 'violet spectral line data the error in the slope was found to be higher than the diffraction grating uncertainty these two data sets having a higher standard error could be due to a different hydrogen lamp being used for them as the first lamp blew while we were taking data the hydrogen lamp was also moved slightly during the measuring of the blue line data which could have very slightly affected the path of the beam through the slit into the camera this could have been improved by using clamps to secure the lamp and spectrometer tightly to the worktop only duplicate readings were taken for the angular displacement readings the precision of the data points could have been improved by increasing this to at least 4 repeat measurements of the data set the three obtained values for the rydberg constant via this diffraction grating experiment are 1.10 ± 0.02 × 10 7 1.10 ± 0.04 × 10 7 and 1.09 ± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 this method has thus been an effective means to determine the value of the rydberg constant as the widely accepted correct value of the constant 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 lies within the range each calculated value 's error margin in order to reduce the level of uncertainty in the future the experiment should be carried out with the hydrogen lamp and grating spectrometer clamped into place in order to prevent any off-balancing knocks and another few sets of readings would have been ideal to increase the reliability of the data gathered,extended,exp
31,GS_HDP206_Redacted,in this paper i will present the method and results for an experiment with a grating spectrometer the purpose is to calculate a value of the rydberg constant by shining a hydrogen lamp through a grating spectrometer by measuring the diffraction angles with the spectrometer the transition wavelengths for hydrogen can be calculated with the wavelength and the transitions levels it is possible to calculate the rydberg constant and its uncertainty to get sufficient amount of statistical data we measured several transitions from the balmer series from the transitions 3→2 and 4→2 we got an average value for the rydberg constant 𝑹 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 a difference of 3.6 from the accepted value he motive for this experiment is to calculate the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ from the balmer series for hydrogen the experimental method in the laboratory is based on a grating spectrometer using a hydrogen lamp as light source hot or electrically excited gasses emit photons in which the emission is concentrated at a few well defined wavelengths-called `` emission line spectra '' our light source uses hydrogen gas which by an electrical current through the gas excites photons at specific wavelengths four of these wavelengths is in the visible spectrum and can be measured with the spectrometer this device uses a lens to produce a collimated beam of light made of several distinct wavelengths which is dispersed with a grating and split into its component wavelengths with each separate wavelength heading in different directions determined by the relationship the dispersed light beam is then focused and viewed with an eyepiece in this way the various wavelengths can be determined by measuring the angles at which the light beams are dispersed the balmer series for hydrogen represents a series of energy levels for orbital electrons when an electron makes a transition from an initial state of higher energy to a state of lower energy the atom emits a photon of energy if we know the energy levels and the corresponding wavelength the rydberg constant can be calculated a diagram of the grating spectrometer used in this experiment is shown in figure 1. the grating behaves like a multi-slit aperture with many closely spaced slits with a separation between adjacent slits of d. the light beam is diffracted by the grating at an angle θ thus for neighbouring light beams the path difference is d sin θ as shown in the inset in fig 1 the light beams will interfere constructively only if the path difference is an integer number of wavelengths where m is called the order number the rays from all slits will interfere constructively at the angles where m is an integer producing a principal maximum in that direction. transition wavelengths for hydrogen are given by the rydberg formula where n and p are integers which represent the energy levels of the initial and final states for transitions in the atom respectively 𝑅 ∞ is the rydberg constant which has the accepted value 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 these transitions are illustrated in fig 2. to set up the spectrometer we used a sodium lamp since it provides a stable light source without going warm the spectrometer used in the experiment consisted of a collimator grating camera lens and eyepiece mounted on a rotatable foundation as shown in fig 3. the angle of the telescope camera lens and eyepiece relative to the collimator can be read with a vernier scale an illustration sketch of the spectrometer source http //spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys273/manual/diffract.html first we focused the eyepiece on the cross wire and the camera lens such that an object 10 m away was focused on the cross wire furthermore we aligned the telescope with the axis of the collimator with the sodium lamp close to the slit the collimator was focused on the slit to get the grating accurately parallel to the collimated beam the following procedure was followed the telescope was rotated 90 deg and clamped in position placed a grating with 78.8 lines per mm in the holder turned the grating table until a reflected image of the entrance slit was seen in the eyepiece with the vernier scale the grating was rotated 45 deg so that it was parallel to the collimated beam. with the setup we could see 3 distinct spectral lines for hydrogen with the red as the brightest light blue aqua slightly dimmer and violet not as bright since red and light blue was easiest to measure accurately we focused on measuring them in our experiment the slit width was measured to 0.07 deg. at the 0 order for the red lines we started from order -7 and moved to order 5 reading the vernier scale at every order for the light blue lines we measured order -9 -8 -7 0 3 4 5 and 6 since the measurements at the higher orders give more accurate reading and it saves time the uncertainty of reading the vernier scale was estimated to 0.03 deg the data for the red emission lines is shown in fig 4. using the line fit we can calculate the wavelength with equation 1 obtaining the wavelength 𝜆 694 ± 3 10 −9 𝑚. from the accepted values of the balmer series the transition 3→2 give red light at a wavelength 656 10 −9 𝑚. since this is the lowest energy level in the visible spectrum we can conclude that this is the transition we measured to calculate the rydberg constant we use our measured wavelength in equation 2 where n 3 and p 2. the result is the value 𝑅 ∞ 1.037 ± 0.014 10 7 𝑚 −1 the same procedure can be applied to the measurement of light blue aqua see fig 5 for data which yields the wavelength 𝜆 492 ± 0.2 10 −9 𝑚. from the accepted values of the balmer series the transition 4→2 give aqua light at a wavelength 486 10 −9 𝑚. this is very close to our measured value relative to the neighbouring transitions thus we can conclude that this is the transition we measured in the same manner the rydberg constant can be calculated but with n 4 and p 2. giving the value 𝑅 ∞ 1.084 ± 0.014 10 7 𝑚 −1 combining the values we get the mean rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 with a percentage uncertainty of 1.9 the largest error is from the measured values for the red emission lines a potential source for this could stem from a difference in the setup since the red emission lines was done in the first lab session and the aqua lines in the second it is therefore possible that there was a difference in the setup such as the grating not being perfectly aligned for the aqua light we were able to measure order -9 and 6 which gives a more accurate measurement of the wavelength furthermore there is a systematic error related to the reading of the vernier scale which has an estimated error of 0.03 deg in addition the light pollution in the laboratory mainly from other desk lamps made the readings harder another source of systematic error is the hydrogen lamp which contains small quantities of other materials this effect is neglected as small since we did not see any other bright emission lines the uncertainty can also be a result random error which can be reduced by taking more measurements this was not done due to the long setup and time set of to the other part of the experiment the result of 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 is relative close to the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ 1.09737316 10 7 𝑚 −1 this suggests that our experiment agrees with the theory and the accepted value of the rydberg constant however there are a difference in the values and an associated uncertainty a review of the method of the experiment is therefore important in this experiment the set up has a substantial impact on how easy and accurate the measurements are we felt that our setup gave better results in the second session where we measured the aqua light since we were able to see higher orders and got more consistent data this uncertainty could have been avoided by using the same setup but this was not possible due to time shortage in the first session on the same manner with more time we would be able to get more measurements which would reduce our random error furthermore a potential solution to minimize the systematic error is to use a ccd camera to find the principal maximum emission lines and a magnetic sensor to measure the angle that the spectrometer is rotated at the aim of the experiment was to calculate the rydberg constant from the balmer series for hydrogen the experimental method was based on a grating spectrometer using a hydrogen lamp as light source through this method we obtained the result of 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 and a percentage uncertainty of 1.9 compared to the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ 1.09737316 10 7 𝑚 −1 our result is relative good at a percentage difference of 3.6 however the uncertainty of 1.9 could have been reduced by minimizing our systematic errors and reducing the random error by taking more measurements some of the important factors with the experiment was the setup of the spectrometer and taking consistently accurate measurements with the eyepiece and the vernier scale a potential solution to minimize this systematic error is to digitalize the measurements of the emission lines and diffraction angle the spectrometer enables us to highly accurate measure spectrums and lines of light it is widely used in science astrophysics and engineering and its findings has helped us explain the elements of faraway objects the gaseous layers of space and even the composition of the universe,superficial,bal
32,GS_FVA673_Redacted,the rydberg constant was calculated by observing the balmer series of hydrogen a hydrogen lamp was observed through a grating spectrometer upon which the wavelength of the colours observed was measured using which the rydberg constant could be calculated only the first 2 balmer lines hα and hβ were intense enough to be observed and the rydberg constant was separately calculated for each with the hα line the rydberg constant was calculated to be 1.094×10 7 ± 0.2423 m -1 the theoretical value of 1.097×10 7 refer to 'theory section for derivation of theoretical value

light source and measuring their intensities and wavelengths hot or electrically excited gases emit spectra concentrated at a few wavelengths in this experiment a grating spectrometer was used to observe a hydrogen lamp and calculate the wavelength of the spectral lines observed for simplicity only the balmer series was analysed as they lie in the visible spectrum only two spectral lines were observed the two lines were red and blue with the red line being more intense hence we deduce that the red line is hα 3 to 2 and the blue line is hβ 4 to 2 as the former is more probable than the other and the remaining balmer lines were not intense enough to be observed as their transition are very improbable 1 using this data the rydberg constant can be calculated for each balmer line observed a grating is a large number of slits equally spaced separated by a distance d. light passing through a grating hence undergoes diffraction for a light of wavelength 𝜆 a principal maximum occurs when phase difference between two rays is an integral multiple n of 2π 2 in the case of 2 neighbouring beams from the figure one sees that the path difference is dsinө hence the spectrometer is used to measure different values sinө corresponding to their respective values of n. the value of d depends on the grating used hence using the data from the spectrometer and equation a the wavelength of light can be calculated the grating constant n implies that there are n number of slits per unit length hence the distance between each slit is the inverse of the grating constant the wavelength can then be substituted into the rydberg formula stated in the 'theory section and the rydberg constant can be calculated one must deduce the value of n and p for the various balmer lines observed based on their relative intensity the improbability of a transition is proportional to how large the transition is hence reducing the intensity of light observed as the transition gets higher upon my lab partner and i taking two individual readings for every fringe the maximum difference between our readings was 3 minutes 0.05 degrees hence error in the angle measurement is 0.05 degrees the value

through a grating spectrometer upon which the wavelength of the balmer lines observed were measured using which the rydberg constant could be estimated the experiment was a success in that the calculated value of rydberg constant was inaccurate only by 0.28 but the theoretical value did not lie in the error range of the calculated value this experiment was very useful and important because it taught us to use a spectrometer which is a very important instrument and has a wide number of uses in various fields it is also one of the most accurate instruments in the laboratory this experiment could be improved if the telescope had a higher resolving power so the crosshair can be placed more accurately by reducing ambient light the slit can be smaller in size thereby making

33,GS_GOO868_Redacted,through methods of spectroscopy we were able to calculate a value for the rydberg constant a constant that is used when calculating the wavelengths of emitted light from hydrogen atoms and more specifically the wavelengths from the balmer series the balmer series that we measured were the photons from electrons that had de-excited from a high energy level to the second energy level of a hydrogen atom as a result our procedure was to use a hydrogen source and for the light to be diffracted through a grating the light from the diffraction grating was then measured and for the wavelengths to be calculated from their respective angles by calculating the wavelengths of the light we were able to produce a value for the rydberg constant 1.69562 × 10 6 m -1 ± 3.13799 × 10 5 m -1 the true value of the rydberg constant however is 1.0973731568508 × 10 7 m -1 1 this constant is useful when investigating the bohr model 2 for atoms and so provides a great initial investigation into the structure of atoms at a more fundamental level n order to calculate a value for the rydberg constant we had to use a new technique to measure the wavelengths of the emitted light from the hydrogen source spectroscopy furthermore through this experiment we were able to look at the behaviour of light through a diffraction grating and how the components of the light emitted are able to provide details of the source and thus the structure of hydrogen atoms to complete this experiment and to understand the implications of such an experiment the theoretical background must be understood since there is an equation relating the number of slits per unit length in the diffraction grating and the wavelength of the light through the grating the different wavelengths are produced at varying angles additionally since there is an equation relating wavelength and the rydberg constant these measurements that we were able to take allowed for this constant to be calculated we used a spectrometer for this experiment and by using a hydrogen lamp the correct measurements were taken also due to the way in which the hydrogen lamps depletes so quickly the sodium lamp was used for the initial calibration this experiment involved using a vernier scale and so it was of vital importance to measure the value accurately especially when considering some of the values were of such a small value and difference the balmer series is of great importance to research and so understanding this characteristic of light from a hydrogen source has implications on research being conducted at the moment the abundance of hydrogen within the universe also makes this series vitally important when it comes to the classification of stars and other cosmological objects 3 the nature of light allows for certain predictions to be made when light interacts with an obstacle and thus due to this predictability the characteristics of a light source can be measured the grating itself is composed of equally spaced slits of which there is a larger number n and with each slit separated by a distance d. the light then passes through each slit for it then to interfere with light from other slits within the grating the way in which light interferes with other waves involves the phase difference 𝜙 of the light during its interaction with other waves this causes superposition between the waves and thus determines at which angle there are maxima and minima this phase difference can then be shown through these equations where 𝜆 is the wavelength of light emitted from the source m is the order number and 𝜃 is the angle of the light from the normal to the diffraction grating consequently with varying wavelengths being emitted from the transitions of electrons to the second energy level the angle will vary and so the different wavelengths can be detected to ensure however that each line could be detected consider a second wavelength λ. as a result a relationship between the two wavelengths can be shown through these two equations where δ𝜆 is the difference between the two wavelengths 𝜆 and λ. the condition of this value for this equation being such that δ𝜆 ≪ 𝜆. therefore from this equation it reveals how the resolution of the image is dependent upon n the number of slits in the diffraction grating as a result of these equations we are able to show that through the methods of spectroscopy it is possible to observe the different wavelengths of light at varying angles from the normal to the diffraction grating these different wavelengths are being emitted from a hydrogen atom and can be related between the initial and final energy states of the atom this is due to the way in which the greater the energy transition the shorter the wavelength this relationship is from these equations and definitions where 𝑅 ∞ is the rydberg constant 3 n is the initial state and p is the final state with both being integers α the fine structure constant 4 𝑚 𝑒 the mass of the electron h the planck 's constant e the charger of an electron and 𝜀 0 the permittivity of free space for the balmer series that we observed the final state was the hydrogen atom 's second energy state and so the value of p would be 2 in equation 2 being the x-axis from this the gradient can be calculated therefore to calculate a value for the rydberg constant it would be to calculate the gradient of the line produced from our data and thereby determine a value for the rydberg constant in order to complete this experiment the setup of the spectrometer must be completed so as to ensure that all the measurements taken are accurate in addition due to the extreme sensitivity of the experiment and the small values that we dealt with the setup of this experiment was vital to the success of the experiment for this experiment it was important to get as many data points as possible so as to ensure that the values we end with are reliable and accurate also due to the way in which our setup was designed the hydrogen lamp had a limited amount of usage to overcome this problem a sodium lamp was used to calibrate and setup the spectrometer due to the way in which the calibration only required the zeroth order from the diffraction grating which is the same regardless of the source used so as to focus the eyepiece that we used we focused the eyepiece on the cross wire this guaranteed that each measurement we took was from a precise point that could be seen clearly by ourselves if it were to be a blurred image of the cross wire it would be difficult to determine from which point we took the measurement and if we were n't able to take the measurements from the same point of the strip it would make each measurement unfairly measured when compared to the other measurements we took to then focus the lens of the eye piece we aligned the telescope of the spectrometer onto a distant object approximately 5 to 10 metres from the telescope this allows for a clear image to be seen when measuring the spectral lines however such focus allows for a minimal parallax between the spectral lines that we are measuring and the cross wire within the telescope following the previous process we had to ensure that the collimator within the spectrometer had been properly focused as a result by putting the sodium lamp in front of slit and the telescope aligned with single spectral line produced since there 's no grating the collimator lens should be focused to make the image of the spectral line a clear and sharp image this allows for clear measurements of the spectral lines to be taken due to the ability of the cross wire to precisely line up with the centre of the spectral lines to ensure that the spectrometer was setup correctly it was vital to ensure that certain screws of the spectrometer were left alone and thus make it easier for accurate measurements to be taken and for the spectrometer to be secured in place 5 for the setting up of the spectrometer we recorded the initial value of the telescope 's angle when with no grating a single spectral line was seen and we then moved the telescope through by 90 degrees we then placed the grating into the holders on the grating table and moved the table round until we could see the reflection of the spectral line in the eyepiece of the telescope we then adjusted the height of the table to allow for the whole spectral line to be seen fully the value of the angle at this point was then recorded and we then moved the grating table back through 45 degrees for it to then be normal to the incident ray on the diffraction grating the spectrometer we used can be seen in the image below 6 after using the sodium lamp for the calibration we used the hydrogen lamp so as to collect the appropriate data from the balmer series we also kept moving the hydrogen lamp 's position in front of the slit to try and allow for as much light as possible thus making it easier for us to collect readings when collecting the data we tried to eliminate as much background light as possible to ensure that we were not seeing incorrect readings furthermore due to similar experiments with similar setups being conducted within close proximity of our own experiment we decided to ensure that we blocked each light with black card this was important because since the telescope would move round to detect the image 3.1 this is a photo of the spectrometer used in this experiment and as can be seen at the centre of the image the grating table that held the grating table is placed the screw underneath the grating table controlled the height of the table however a screw behind the telescope the right side 's eyepiece telescope allows for small movements to be taken the slow motion drive the screws either side of each telescope focuses the lens of their respective telescopes and the screw underneath the telescope keeps the scale in place spectral lines it became important to block these other sources of light that may have come into view for this experiment we measured the angle from the centre of the spectral line for each colour and we continued to move through the orders until the intensity of the light was too dark to be able to determine its colour however it was important to try and measure as many different colours and consequently wavelengths as possible from this the aim was to try and produce a more accurate gradient and then from this a better value for the rydberg constant furthermore after aligning the telescope but before we took our reading we had to turn off the hydrogen lamp to guarantee the lamp would n't deplete and thus allow for more readings to be taken during our laboratory session the specific setup that we used to measure the orders of the different wavelengths can be seen in the diagram below and using this setup a spectrometer can be used so as to collect accurate data for the experiment the data that we collected for each colour can be seen in the figures below and with each of these data points have an associated error that is carried through in the final calculation we repeated measurements for the aqua because it appeared at the time that we had carried out our measurements incorrectly the true values can be shown below 7 from this data it shows that the blue data we collected was inaccurate in terms of its closeness to the actual values despite the error being extremely large this is due to the diagram 3.1 this is the diagram of the experimental setup that we used the first lens the rays interact with is from the collimator with the blue dotted line acting as the diffraction grating the second lens then acts as the camera with the third eyepiece belonging to the eye piece from this setup we were able to measure the angle of the light from the diffraction grating error being small in terms of each initial measurement however when carried through in terms of the error of the end result a larger error is produced this disparity may have been as a result of inaccurate measurements because when measuring the angles we may have misaligned the cross wires over the line and so incorrect measurements in addition since we completed these measurements in a separate session the calibration of the spectrometer may have been incorrect and thus causing the disparity between the values on the other hand the data we collected for the red and aqua spectral lines were near real values and hence accurate measurements since the real values fell within the error of each data set the rydberg constant can therefore be calculated and is shown in the graph below however when looking at the graph it is clear to see that there is an anomaly the furthest left data point it is known that this is the anomalous data point because the line needs to have a negative gradient this further emphasises the inaccuracy of the blue spectral line data and the need to have collected more data however more importantly to have the spectrometer correctly calibrated this is evident because if the anomalous data was removed the gradient would change and from this a value for the rydberg constant is found 𝑅 ∞ 9.891682 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 ± 3.69817 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 and this value is much closer to the real value and although it does not have the real value within the error bars it is significantly closer to the real value as a result having more data sets for other wavelengths would have produced a more accurate value of the rydberg constant the aim of this experiment was to gain a value for the rydberg constant which was achieved however unless you remove the anomaly from the data we collected an inaccurate value was produced additionally due to two data points having much better accuracy and precision it reveals how when conducting the second set of experiments for the blue spectral lines the spectrometer was setup incorrectly this experiment also provided us with the ability to use and understand this new technique of spectroscopy this is important because it also provides the platform to conduct further experiments in the future when conducting further experiments in other areas of physics the theory of this experiment gave the background to this experiment and thus allowed for certain measurements to be taken to allow for characteristics of a hydrogen atom to be measured and understood this balmer series is still important to modern research and so to understand its origin is important the successes of this experiment were limited however because due to the inaccuracy and disparity of some of the data points the rydberg constant 's value came out to be inaccurate in comparison to the desired value nonetheless if these data points were removed an accurate result would be found the failure of this experiment was in these inaccurate data points and so to improve certain steps can be taken to improve accuracy for example the error could have been calculated by measuring either side of the spectral line and so the error being half the range of these two values and then the standard error being calculated from all the values we measured in addition we could have taken more repeats thereby producing more reliable data and thus make it easier to find the correct values a darker environment could have been made and hence reduce disturbance from the background however the main improvement would be to have spent more time on the setup of the spectrometer this improvement guarantees that there is more accuracy for each data point as well as precision because it reduces the possibility of there being an original offset that then makes all values measured incorrect this experiment allowed us to achieve certain goals in terms of data collection and accuracy however from this experiment we were able to see the way in which the rydberg constant relates to physical attributes in the hydrogen atom and as a result learn more about the bohr model of the atom and the implications this has within the structure of an atom,superficial,the
34,GS_DAR896_Redacted,the following paper explores how an optical diffraction-grating spectrometer which investigated visible spectral lines of the hydrogen balmer series was used to determine rydberg 's constant using the precise set-up equipment reliable measurements of spectral lines for several orders of diffraction were obtained both red and blue spectral lines were independently measured and investigated to estimate a value of rydberg 's constant these values were then compared with the accepted theoretical value from quantum mechanics graphical and computational analysis was then used to determine the estimated values for rydberg 's constant the observed red and blue spectral lines produced a value of 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 respectively when compared to the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 the respective percentage errors produced for rydberg 's constant were 0.38 and 2.67 the importance of investigating the hydrogen balmer series and subsequently determining the rydberg constant to high precision is most relevant in astronomy this is partly because hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe 1 thus when studying celestial bodies such as stars measurements can then be used to identify that specific hydrogen processes such as that causing the hydrogen balmer series are taking place the importance of this experiment therefore stems from being able to better understand sub-atomic processes which we observe and use every day in physics the various spectra which have been observed are what led to the study of atomic physics and quantum mechanics 1 the experimental value obtained in this experiment can therefore be compared with the accepted theoretical value for rydberg 's constant hence this could check the validity of the accepted value and be used to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the experimental procedure hence this could lead to a method of finding ways to improve the accuracy and resolution obtained when taking astronomical readings the various series created are due to emission and absorption processes in atoms which create sequences such as the balmer and lyman series in hydrogen these series result from electrons in the hydrogen atom transitioning from higher states of quantum number to stable quantum states n 2 and n 1 respectively 1 due to spontaneous emission these transitions reduce the electrons energy by discreate amounts which causes monoenergetic photons to be emitted with discreate wavelengths the underlying physics processes taking place in this experiment are the emission of monoenergetic packets of light due to orbital electron transitions which follow the hydrogen balmer series and diffraction here a hydrogen lamp acted as the light source and a diffraction grating spectrometer was then used to diffract the light using these instruments the monochromatic wavelengths of light emitted in the hydrogen balmer series for different electron transitions were found this allowed us to estimate a value for the rydberg constant using the rydberg equation the hydrogen lamp emits light by heating the hydrogen gas 2 which causes hydrogen atoms to become excited as an orbital electron transitions to a higher quantum state consequently the electron shortly spontaneously emits back to the original stable quantum state during this electronic transition a light photon of monochromatic wavelength is emitted because of the transition between monoenergetic levels using a spectrometer to determine rydberg 's constant by investigating the hydrogen balmer series these light waves of single wavelengths then diffract through a diffraction grating to create an inte1ference pattern on a screen due to the superposition of diffracted light waves the theo1y of these processes is described further in section ii the rest of this repo1t will describe fuither the experimental and theoretical methods used to detennine rydberg 's constant and then draw conclusions from those findings the discreate energy of a photon spontaneously emitted by a hydrogen atom in the balmer series is given by where his planck 's constant and f is the frequency of the photon emitted in the balmer series this energy is lost by the hydrogen atom as an orbital electron in an excited quantum state spontaneously de-excites to quantum state n 2. thus the energy of the monoenergetic photon emitted is equal to the energy difference between the two quantum states where e1 is the initial energy of the hydrogen atom and ei is the final energy the monochromatic wavelengths of light emitted by the hydrogen atom in the balmer series given by 3 where c is the speed of light in a vacuum can be found by equating i and 2 to obtain .. he/ ei-ei 4 balmer also developed a fo1mula in 1885 to measure the wavelength .. of the balmer series where n are integers 1 2 3 ... and c is the balmer constant rydberg generalized this in 1889 for the entire emission spectrnm of hydrogen as where r is the rydberg constant nf is the final quantum state and ni is the initial quantum state where nf= 2 for the hydrogen balmer series l when the monochromatic wavelength light waves reach the diffraction grating the interference pattern produced contain spectral lines maxima positions from where the waves constrnctively superpose and inte1fere the phase difference between successive maxima is therefore 2ijc thus d sin e ma. 7 where d is the slit separation 0 is the angle of diffraction and m is the order of diffraction in the expe1iment equation 7 was used to find the s. ingle wavelengths emitted in the hydrogen balmer series for red ni 3 and blue ni 4 light then equation 6 was used to dete1mine the estimated values for rydberg 's constant the experimental method used was able to significantly reduce many systematic and random enors effect on the experiment which were obse1ved this resulted in obtaining a precise and accurate methodology which is a reproducible and reliable method for estimating rydberg 's constant accurate techniques including computational analysis was then used to obtain the estimated values for rydberg 's constant and their associated e1rnrs the diffraction grating spacing was dete1mined using the provided number of lines per unit length from the manufacturer 2 this info1mation gave an approximated value of 12.7 x 10-0 m for the slit separation a similar slit separation is needed for this experiment to obse1ve many orders of diffraction since the range of wavelengths for electro-magnetic waves in the visible light region is approximately 390 nm -700 nm a pasco student spectrometer such as in figure 1 was used to diffract the monoenergetic light emitted by the hydrogen lamp and to obse1ve the spectral emission lines produced eyepiece 3 to show how a spectrometer works when light is incident on it from the slit and how it can be used to find the wavelength of the light 2 as shown in figure 2 the spectrometer which was used had a collimator and slit which caused the incoming light photons from the hydrogen lamp to become a parallel beam then the grating was used to diffract according to 7 the n01mal incidence beam into an interference pattern of spectral lines which was finally focused and obse1ved as an image in the telescope which is composed of the camera and eyepiece 2 the spectrometer was set-up following the instructions provided in the 'first year laborato1y manual 2017 -2018 2 key points in the methodology were as follows • we focused the eyepiece on the crosswire so that an image roughly 30 cm away could be optimally obse1ved with limited eye strain this reduced random enor as the specti•al lines obse1ved were more well defined through the eyepiece • then the camera lens was focused on a distant object roughly 10 m away where incoming light could be assumed to be parallel so that there was no parallax enor between the cross wire and image this reduced the random e1rnr due to human obse1vation associated significantly • then we aligned the collimator and telescope turning on and placing the hydrogen lamp in an optimal position to the collimator slit then focused the collimator to see the slit image more sharply • after we moved the telescope through 90 degrees and inse1t ed the grating into the holder this meant the collimator and eyepiece were pe1pendicular then turned the grating table until there was an image of the slit in the eyepiece this meant that the grating table was at 45 degrees to the incident beam from the collimator this is because the incident light was being reflected off the grating • at this point in the set-up there was a significant systematic enor with the specti•ometer which may have been due to the manufacturer it was noticed that the vernier scale readings did n't match the theoretically expected value by roughly a 10-degree offset this could n't be resolved but didn t have a bearing on the result obtained • finally the grating was positioned pe1pendicular to the incident light from the collimator which was aligned with the telescope this was done by rotating the grating by 45 degrees a centi•al zero order fringe was seen through the telescope when it was aligned with the collimator which indicated the spectrometer was aligned properly the vernier scale was used to accurately measure the angles of diffraction which the telescope obse1ved at maxima positions at least 5 orders of diffraction left and 1ight of the centi•al zeroth order fringe were used beyond which the line specti•a became less visible and bluned to dete1mine the angles of diffraction the measured angles at each order of diffraction was subti•acted from the measured angle at the centi•al fringe 8 where 0m is the angle measured by the vernier scale at each respective order of diffraction and 0c is the angle measured by the vernier scale at the centi•al zeroth order fringe this provided the necessary measurements needed to dete1mine the wavelengths of light emitted from the hydrogen balmer series which were investigated using equation 7 and consequently estimate the value ofrydberg 's constant using equation 6 the effect of background light on the clru•ity of the spectral lines obse1ved in the telescope was a systematic enor which was reduced in the experiment .. this was achieved by making the environment as dark as possible with baniers used to stop any light reflecting towards the specti•ometer as these measures resulted in well-defined specti•al lines it was assumed that any systematic e1rnr from this source was neglible also another identified systematic enor was the width of specti•al lines which if significantly wide would need to be measured using the vernier scale at each edge an average value could then be used in equation 8 to find the angles of diffraction however when this was done for the highest order of diffraction used the measured angles on the vernier scale showed that the width was too small for resolution of the vernier scale hence this systematic e1rnr was also ignored during the expe1iment as was assumed to be neglible the lamp was also positioned relatively close to the collimator slit so that the intensity of the spectral lines obse1ved in the eyepiece were more well defined also the lamp was aligned with the collimator and grating so that the maximum amount of light would enter the collimator slit finally to reduce background light the inside of the hydrogen lamp had a black cover to stop any other light entering the collimating slit another systematic error encountered during the experiment was a spectrometer misalignment this was noticed when the grating was positioned at 45 degrees to the incident beam when the collimator slit and telescope were perpendicular to each other it was expected that the vernier scale would show 45 degrees difference between both the collimator and telescope as the incident light was reflecting off the grating however while these relative positions in the spectrometer were correct the vernier scale read a value which was 3.90 degrees off the expected theoretical value this may have been a problem with the manufacturer as another spectrometer of the same type showed a similar misalignment when being set-up however as this was a systematic error which did n't affect the angles of diffraction when the spectrometer was set-up this had no bearing on the calculations of rydberg 's constant thus the systematic error involved was ignored the misalignment of the spectrometer had no affect on the measured angles of diffraction because when using equation 8 the measured positions θ m and θ c are relative to only each other the main source of random error which was introduced in the experiment was when taking measurements of the angles diffracted by line spectra using the vernier scale while the vernier scale was highly precise the main random error associated with the measuring equipment was the resolution of the vernier scale which was estimated to be 0.05 degrees this random error was estimated by judging how many divisions on the vernier scale appeared to be also correct and then halving this range which was the estimated random error used for this the actual resolution in angle which the vernier scale can measure of 0.017 degrees was not used for this estimation because of human error limiting the resolution of the method further than the equipment used when visually observing the vernier scale it was apparent that there was no clear and correct marking to use thus it was estimated that 6 markings on the vernier scale appeared to be the possible correct marking the estimated error of 0.05 degrees was then found by calculating the angle covered by half of those divisions the other main random error associated with this method of measuring was human error due to incorrectly reading the vernier scale poor judgment to approximate this random error two observers independently measured the angles of diffraction the mean value was calculated as the average of the two readings the standard error was then calculated and used as the associated estimate of this random error finally to estimate the combined random error associated with each angle of diffraction the approximated random errors were added to get the combined estimated error associated with each angle measured on the vernier scale then as the angle of diffraction is calculated using equation 8 the estimated random errors of each respective angle measured θ m and θ c was added in quadrature as equation 7 was used to find the wavelengths of light emitted as part of the hydrogen balmer series the values and associated errors of sin θ for each order of diffraction were found the value was found by inputting the angle of diffraction to find the associated errors the following formula was used where φ is the estimated error of each respective angle of diffraction this approximation for the error was used because φ was relatively small thus could assume that around θ the curve approached linearity this meant that the error above and below the value of sin θ were the same also since the value of θ was relatively small a small angle approximation also supports this method of approximating the associated errors using equation 7 to find the wavelengths of light emitted from the hydrogen balmer series meant a graph of sin θ against m the order of diffraction was used the slit separation d multiplied by the gradient of the graph would hence provide the wavelengths computational analysis was used to create and analyze these graphs for blue and red light as shown in figures 3 4 5 and 6. figure 5. the graph used to find the wavelength of red light using equation 7 it is clear that the method used was highly precise due to the clear linear relationship exhibited and the small deviation of points to the line of best fit also methods of reducing systematic errors appear to have been successful as there is a relatively small y-intercept this method provided wavelengths of 473 ± 10.2 nm and 659 ± 0.761 nm for the blue and red light respectively however when this was compared to the actual values of 486 nm and 656 nm respectively 4 the estimated results for blue and red light did n't include the expected values in their estimated errors this indicated that the associated random errors may have been underestimated and some sources of error may not have been identified and included in the experimental calculations using equation 6 and error calculations provided from source 2 the estimated values and associated errors of rydberg 's constant for red light where the orbital electron spontaneously emits the red light from initial quantum state n i 3 and blue light where the orbital electron spontaneously emits the blue light from initial quantum state n i 4 were calculated the estimated values and associated errors of rydberg 's constant were 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 for red light and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 for blue light compared to the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 the respective percentage errors produced for rydberg 's constant were 0.38 and 2.67 however as the estimated values for the wavelength of blue and red light did n't include the expected values the estimated values for rydberg 's constant also did n't include the theoretical value the aim of this experiment was to determine the rydberg constant through investigating the hydrogen balmer series using a grating spectrometer this was achieved by using a pasco student spectrometer and hydrogen lamp the optical spectrometer was used to measure the angles of diffraction for multiple orders for the red and blue light emitted as part of the hydrogen balmer series graphical and computational analysis was then used to attain precise estimated values for rydberg 's constant the experiment provided estimated values for rydberg 's constant of 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 for red light and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 for blue light this was compared to the accepted theoretical value of rydberg 's constant of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 with red and blue light producing respective percentage errors for rydberg 's constant of 0.38 and 2.67 the experiment was able to successfully reduce the main sources of systematic error as shown by the observed spectral lines which were well defined the misalignment of the spectrometer by 3.90 degrees however was a systematic error which could n't be resolved during the experiment also the measurements taken were highly accurate with the vernier scale being used to obtain high resolution readings and reducing human error significantly however the experiment did n't obtain estimated results which included the theoretical value of rydberg 's constant this indicated that the estimation of random errors was n't as accurate as possible this may have been due to underestimating the random errors associated with reading the vernier scale or it equati on of l ine of best f i t 0.05194 x 0.005208 ■ may have been a significant source of random error which was n't taken into consideration to improve the experiment an aligned spectrometer should be used to repeat the method as the vernier scale may have been unprecise which was perceived as being misaligned in the experiment which would be a significant random error which could n't be tested for also a more sophisticated experimental set-up could be used such as a computer-aided spectrophotometer to obtain more accurate results this could also allow other wavelengths of light from the hydrogen balmer series to be investigated once the experimental method is refined this would provide a highly accurate and precise method of determining rydberg 's

35,GS_XMC918_Redacted,the uncertainties in the measurement of each angle were estimated simply by taking several readings of each maxima and comparing them to find a range the uncertainty used for each data point was then half the total range which was found to be 1/6 of a degree sources of systematic error were mostly not possible for us to measure in the time available so for example we did not obtain enough measurements of maxima to both sides of the centre to compare them and assess how much error may be arising from slight asymmetries in the alignment of the spectrometer instead the results here are based on measurements just to one side of the centre and this error can not be quantified similarly other potential sources of error such as atmospheric conditions affecting the optical properties of the air and therefore altering the wavelength due to a potential change in the speed of light were not accounted for as these conditions i.e humidity air pressure were not measured when the experiment was being carried out furthermore as other work was being done in the lab variations in background light could not be avoided meaning some data points may have underestimated uncertainties if background light was higher when the measurements were taken specifically to the setup we used the spectrometer was balanced on a table which did not perfectly sit flat on the table we attempted to prevent it wobbling while we made our measurements by placing some paper under one of the legs but this did not seem to fully remedy the problem so it may have created some random errors if it was not in exactly the same position for all the measurements the results we were able to obtain include only two wavelengths of the balmer series as lower wavelengths were not visible with the set up used the two correspond to n values of 3 for the red light and 4 for the blue violet light which we assume to correspond to n=5 was visible only to the first maximum and so we were unable to gather enough data points to calculate a precise value for its wavelength and other colours were not visible at all as shown in fig 2 and 3 the data fits extremely well to a linear relationship as predicted by our model this allowed us to calculate values for the wavelength of 6614762x10 -13 +/-7x10 -13 m for the red light and 47739x10 -11 +/-1x10 -11 m for the blue using 2 the mean value of the rydberg constant obtained from 3 was 11028400+/-100m -1 this does not agree with the accepted value of 10973731.6m -1 which would suggest that systematic errors in the experiment had a significant impact however considering the individual values for the two different colours the red light gave a value approximately 1 lower than the accepted value while the blue light gave one approximately 2 higher rather than supporting the idea that it was caused by systematic error it instead implies that the problem was that random errors were underestimated the most likely candidate for this phenomenon is the unstable table on which the spectrometer was balanced mentioned in section iii it would explain why the two data sets showed very little error within themselves and yet the two data sets both conflict with both one another and the accepted value it is possible that other sources of error played their part such as background light and atmospheric conditions however it seems less likely that these would have given such a clear divide between the two data sets the unstable table would be more likely as the data sets were taken very close together giving limited time for such a distinct change in humidity or pressure also background light fluctuated throughout the experiment with no chance of giving such a distinct contrast in the two sets of readings another contribution to the error in our results was likely not accounting for possible asymmetries in our set up by only measuring to one side of the centre it is possible that if we had done so we would have noticed the effect of the unstable table and had a chance of quantifying the resultant error instead we are left with no way of stating with any certainty whether this or another unidentified source of error led to the issue in our final value using our method we were able to obtain a value for the rydberg constant which fell within 1 of the accepted value however as we underestimated the systematic errors inherent in our set up our value conflicts with the accepted value despite being so close in order to make it a useful measurement we would need to return to the experiment and thoroughly investigate and quantify the impact of all potential sources of systematic error described in section iii once this was done it would be possible to both more confidently state which source of error caused the issue in this experiment and to repeat the experiment with better control and understanding of these errors to obtain a more accurate value of the rydberg constant another improvement that could likely give a significant increase in the accuracy and precision achievable would be if extra wavelengths could be observed to increase the amount of data available this could be achieved either by changing the source to one in which lower wavelengths were brighter and could be measured another possibility is to use other methods of observation than the naked eye allowing infra-red ultra violet or both to be observed in addition once again this would simply increase the amount of data available to use in calculations thereby reducing statistical error and giving a more precise final value,deep,bal
36,GS_BKZ271_Redacted,"electrons in an atom undergo transitions in between energy levels in the atom when these transitions are from a higher energy state to a lower state the excess energy is emitted in the form of a photon of a certain wavelength for this experiment we use a hydrogen discharge lamp and a spectrometer the transitions emitting photons in the visible region of the spectrum are grouped together into the balmer series the wavelength of these spectral lines can be measured by using a spectrometer to measure the angular positions of the lines and plotting this position against the order of the spectral line the product of the slope of this plot and the slit separation gives us the wavelength the initial and final energy levels can be decided based on the colour of the spectral lines as only certain wavelengths are emitted by the hydrogen lamp the relation between the wavelength and the transition energy levels involves a constant known as rydberg 's constant the aim of this experiment is to measure rydberg 's constant with minimum uncertainty using the hydrogen discharge lamp a spectrometer and python for data analysis the values of rydberg 's constant obtained using red and violet light were for red r 00 1.061 ± 0.0 73 x10 7 m-1 for violet r 00 1.061 ± 0.01 x 10 7 m -1 the spectrometer is an optical instrument used to study t he spectra of different sources of light the light source fo r t his can be a nything from a sodiumvapour lamp to a superhot plasma or a star the term `` light '' is used loosely and refers here to any form of electromagnetic radiation be it infra red or x-rays as in fig 1 the spectrum is one of two fo rms depending on the light source see figure 1 hot solids such as the fi lament in a bulb tungsten emit spectra where intensity varies slowly with wavelength-continuous spectra '' the other form kn own as emission line spectra '' is emitted by hot or electrically excited gases in such a spectrum t he ratio of intensit ies of lines tell you the temperature of the gas while the widths give the density of the gas the spectrometer figure 2 picture of the experimental setup includes the spectrometer and the hydrogen lamp in background 2 the basic fo rm of a spectrometer see figure 2 uses a lens or a mirror to produce a collimated beam of light a nd disperses it with a grating or a prism the dispersed spectrum is then focused onto an eyepiece for viewing electronic detectors can also be used the spectrometer once calibrated can be used to measure the a ngular separation between two orders of diffraction maxima using this angle and the slit separation the wavelength of t he light can be calculated the light source being used is a hydrogen discharge lamp the a im of this experiment is to use the obtained data o n wavelengths to accurately determine t he value of rydberg 's constant the diffraction grating can be considered as a large number n of equally spaced very narrow slits the separation between the slits is 'd consider light of wavelength λ. for this beam of light a principal maximum due to diffraction occurs when the phase difference between neighbouring rays is an integer multiple m of 2π the path difference between neighbouring rays can be calculated from the figure see figure 3 it comes out as thus using equations 1 2 and 3 we get which means here m is called the order number λ is the wavelength and d is the separation between two adjacent slits light of a given colour will be diffracted at a specific angle for a given order all light rays of that colour will be parallel if the incident light rays are parallel light of a different colour is diffracted at a different angle but its light rays will also be parallel according to the theory quantum mechanics an electron bound to an atom can not have any value of energy rather it can only occupy certain states which correspond to certain energy levels the formula defining the energy levels of a hydrogen atom are given by the equation e -e0/n 2 where e0 13.6 ev 1 ev 1.602×10 -19 joules and n 1,2,3… and so on the energy is expressed as a negative number because it takes that much energy to unbind ionize the electron from the nucleus when an electron absorbs a photon it gains the energy of the photon because an electron bound to an atom can only have certain energies the electron can only absorb photons of certain energies if a photon has more energy than the binding energy of the electron then the photon will free the electron from the atom -ionizing it the electron once it has absorbed photon is now in an excited state an electron has a certain probability to drop from one excited state to a lower i.e more negative energy level when an electron drops from a higher level to a lower level it sheds the excess energy a positive amount by emitting a photon the transitions are classified into different series based on the energy of the emitted photon for this experiment the photons are emitted in the balmer series 4 the balmer series the balmer series see figure 4 in hydrogen is observed when an electron jumps down to the second energy level n=2 of the atom emitting a wavelength that depends on n. balmer transition wavelengths are in the visible part of the spectrum transition wavelengths in hydrogen are given by the following formula here λ is the wavelength of the emitted photon 𝑛 1 is the final state energy level of the electron and 𝑛 2 is the initial state energy level of the electron 𝑅 ∞ is rydberg 's constant refer to appendix 1 for derivation of the formula it can also be expressed in terms of more fundamental constants 6 where 𝑚 𝑒 is the mas of the electron c is the speed of light h planck 's constant and 𝛼 is the fine structure constant where e is the coulombic charge on an electron and 𝜀 0 is the permittivity of free space note 𝜶 is a dimensionless constant 𝟏 𝜶 𝟏𝟑𝟕 𝟎𝟑𝟔 before the experiment is started the spectrometer must first be calibrated the initial steps consist of focusing the eyepiece on the cross wires such that the setting is free of eye strain best done with both eyes open next the camera lens is focused such that a distant object is focused onto the cross wires now the telescope is aligned with the collimator see figure 5 for the next part of calibration a sodium-vapour lamp is used the wavelength of the lamp is known to be an average of two lines and is precisely 589.3nm this lamp is then placed in front of the slit of the spectrometer the telescope is moved through 90° and clamped and a grating is put in the holder this diffraction grating was one that had 80 lines/mm lines per millimetre the grating is adjusted to see a reflected image of the slit meaning the grating is at 45° with respect to the collimator beam once the image is centred on the cross wires the reading of the scale is noted and the grating is rotated through precisely 45 degrees thus setting it at normal incidence the height of the image can also be adjusted using the adjustment screws to centre it on the cross wires the spectrometer is now calibrated and set up to take measurements with a precision of under 0.3 or about ±0.2 nm for yellow-orange light 8 the aim of this part of the experiment is to use the spectrometer to measure the wavelengths using the grating equation eqn 4 consider the angular separation of fringes from the central fringe to be θ. then measure θ for different values of m both positive and negative with the sign indicating the side of displacement left or right the width of the slit of the spectrometer can be adjusted vary the intensity and hence the width of the observed spectral lines refer to table 1 for measured values for both red and purple spectral lines note the slit of the spectrometer being used was misaligned causing the spectral lines to be cut horizontally this however did not affect the measuring process or the obtained values as the spectrometer is very precise and the hydrogen lamp is an emitter of pure wavelengths single valued or discreet table 1 from eqn 4 the grating used was 78.8 lines per mm or 2001 lines per inch thus giving a value for 'd which is then used to calculate the wavelength of the light this was done for 3 different transitions-namely red blue and violet shown below is the plot for the violet spectral line refer to appendix 2 for red spectral line 's data the wavelength of the line is then calculated using the gradient slope of the plot the error in the gradient and the slit separation d the wavelength of the red spectral line was calculated to be 678.9 ± 46.8 𝑛𝑚 and that of the violet spectral line was 443 ± 2.1 𝑛𝑚 now that the wavelength has been calculated it can be used to determine that value of rydberg 's constant each transition emits a discreet wavelength in the visible spectrum as shown below in table 2 from the table the values of 𝑛 𝑓 and 𝑛 𝑖 are used as 𝑛 1 and 𝑛 2 from eqn 5 now the value of rydberg 's constant can be calculated using eqn 5 rearranging eqn 5 every observed spectral line has a certain angular spread when observed through the spectrometer this spread can be minimised by narrowing the slit of the instrument for most visible lines the slit can be kept narrow enough so the error is immeasurable with this apparatus but as you pan farther out the lines are blurred and can not be viewed with a narrow slit in these cases the angular spread of the lines is measured and that is used as a measure of the uncertainty in the measurement of the position of the line the uncertainties in table 1 are these very angular spreads since these are measured for the furthest lines observed the error is the maximum possible for the preceding lines also thus this has been accepted as the maximum possible error in each colour in equation 8 m and d are known and so the uncertainty in λ is directly related to the uncertainty in the position the error in the value of rydberg 's constant is simply the error in the inverse wavelength as the values in table 2 are known with certainty thus the error 𝜎 𝜃 was for red 𝜎 𝜃 1'48 '' and violet 𝜎 𝜃 3′ the error calculated for the red spectral line was 46.8 𝑛𝑚 and that for the violet spectral line was 2.1 𝑛𝑚 fri nge order 'm using the values of wavelength 𝑛 𝑖 𝑛 𝑓 and the error calculated as above rydberg 's constant was calculated to be the values of rydberg 's constant obtained from the experiment for red and violet spectral lines are 1.061 ± 0.073 x10 7 m −1 and 1.061 ± 0.01 𝑥 10 7 𝑚 −1 respectively although these values do not coincide with the accepted value of rydberg 's constant which is 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 their uncertainty covers this value this uncertainty however may arise from several sources both random and systematic one of the main causes of a random error is the overheating of the hydrogen lamp which may alter the data and increase uncertainty the change in pressure of the gas in the discharge tube could also contribute to random error as the gas pressure is increased the spikes become broader this 'pressure broadening is a direct consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle and stems from the fact that as the pressure increases the gas molecules undergo more and more collisions thus reducing the average time for which a molecule can remain in a given electronic state the heisenberg principle implies that as the lifetime of given state decreases its energy becomes less and less well defined the net result being that the characteristic emission wavelengths are smeared-out into bands 10 the more systematic errors however arise mainly from misalignment or wrong calibration of the spectrometer the correct focussing of the spectrometer telescope may also add to the error in measuring the position of spectral lines since the observation of spectral lines depends on the light passing through the slit the positioning of the lamp in front of the slit can add to the uncertainty in position of the lines if it is n't placed precisely in front of the slit as mentioned previously the slits of the spectrometer were misaligned causing breaks in the spectral lines but as these breaks in the lines were horizontal in nature it did not affect the measurements the above factors when estimated and included in the uncertainty provide a realistic estimate about the officially accepted value of rydberg 's constant the aim of this experiment was to determine the value of rydberg 's constant to a certain degree of precision and accuracy using a grating spectrometer a sodium-vapour lamp for calibration and a hydrogen discharge lamp to observe the spectral lines the basic theory behind this experiment is derived from the principles and theories of diffraction atomic spectra and the basic ideas of quantum physics the chances of success are strong with this experiment as it uses apparatus with a low margin for error since most of the data analysis is done on python errors due to calculation and human error are minimised although there are n't many light must be shone on the few yet significant possibilities of error in this experiment since the measuring equipment consists of a spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp the main source of error is the relative positioning of the lamp slit and diffraction grating also since the positioning of the telescope and centring of the cross wires is done using our naked eyes accuracy is very limited there is also the systematic error that arises from the spreading of wavelengths widening of the spectral lines this error however can not be measured as beyond a point the cross wires were too thick to accurately measure the angular width of the spectral lines improvement in terms of accuracy can be made by using electronic detectors instead of our naked eyes although our eyes are sensitive they are n't sensitive enough to observe the lines when the slit is at its narrowest position this is prominent when two different observers may detect varying spectral lines to varying degrees of accuracy performing this experiment helps develop skill in taking measurements whilst minimising the error in them it also displays the various advantages and disadvantages of using such an apparatus in an optics experiment the equations for kinetic and potential energies lead to where the constant r is rydberg 's constant and its value is where me is the mass of the electron e is the charge on the electron h is planck 's constant c is the speed of light in vacuum and 𝜀 0 is the permittivity of free space when substituting the officially accepted values of the fundamental constants we find the officially accepted value of rydberg 's constant is 𝑅 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 derivation of rydberg 's constant energy associated with the

38,GS_HSB934_Redacted,"he rydberg constant r relates the transition wavelengths in hydrogen to the energy levels between which the electrons transfer this applies to all elements not just hydrogen thus we can use it to predict the wavelengths emitted from any atom through any energy state transmission r can also be used therefore to determine the difference in energy states through which any electron in any atom may transfer giving us the values for the energy states in that atom the theory of this behavior is described in more depth in section ii spectroscopy was used to enable the repeated observation of one beam emitted from the lamp when set up correctly a spectrometer is capable of making very accurate and repeatable measurements so it is important to set it up very specifically the equipment we used consisted of a collimator a diffraction grating and a telescope by passing it through a diffraction grating the light beam was split up meaning multiple orders could be analyzed to obtain multiple values for the wavelength a diffraction grating of 78.8 lines per mm was employed to achieve this the beam was then passed through a telescope to enable observation further description of the workings of the setup can be found in section iii to carry out the experiment we observed the emissions of a hydrogen lamp a tube containing low-pressure hydrogen gas after excitation through heating or electrifying for example the atoms in the gas lose energy in the form of photons as an electron in an atom transfers to a lower energy state it emits a photon of energy equal to the difference in energies of the two states in a sample of one element only energy levels of specific values exist thus only transitions of specific energies can occur the photoelectric effect then results in the production of photons of certain wavelengths only spectra produced by excited gasses are observed as having emissions at just a few wavelengths creating an 'emission line spectra in hydrogen these 'lines are given the name the balmer series 1 in the laboratory we observed just two lines of which the wavelengths are given by 2 where λ is the wavelength of the light emitted and n represents the initial and p the final state of the atom in the balmer series p=2 and n=3,4,5 ... the fact that only lines of two different colors were observed does not prove n=5 does not exist it is possible other wavelengths of non-visible light were emitted by the gas or that the atoms were not excited enough for the electrons to occupy state n=5 further experimentation would be needed to confirm this in order to obtain multiple measurements of λ different orders of the emission line spectra were looked at figure 1 illustrates how a diffraction grating disperses a beam the order of the beam m can in theory be any integer m and  the angle between the 0 th order and the m th order are related by the equation grating are usually given by the manufacturer in terms of n number of lines per mm d is easily found by calculating n must be multiplied by 10 3 first to find how many lines there are per m so that d can be in units m. in this calculation we assume the thickness of each line is negligible by measuring the angle  for several values of m and plotting m against sin the gradient of the graph becomes d λ ⁄ after multiplication by d 1 λ ⁄ can be substituted into 1 the light from the hydrogen lamp was first to be passed through a narrow slit followed by a collimating lens to produce a very thin collimated beam and then passed through a diffraction grating the light then was to be collected by a telescope consisting of a camera lens and an eyepiece a crosshair x was visible through the telescope eyepiece to help with alignment all measurements were taken with the lines on the centre of the crosshair figure 2 illustrates the path of the beam through the setup a choice of two gratings were available in our laboratory on of 300 lines per mm and one of 78.8 lines per mm i originally decided to use the grating n=300 because i thought this would result in a smaller percentage error for d taking the error would be 0.05 line per mm however upon looking through the eyepiece it was seen that there were more visible orders with the use of the n=78.8 grating so it was decided that we use this one in order to have the opportunity to obtain the maximum number of measurements so that  could be varied the grating was mounted on a rotating grating table or turntable and the telescope which was attached to the turntable could also be rotated the turntable had a vernier scale on it which showed the angular positions of the turntable and the telescope using this  was measured these properties are shown in figure 3. the turntable was also utilized to accurately set up the spectroscopy equipment the grating had to be at precisely 90 to the beam achieving this was challenging the vernier scale on the turntable had a resolution of a sixtieth of a degree so tiny movements in the position of the telescope and angle of the table could be made such movements were made roughly and then fine-tuned using fine adjustment screws before the telescope and turntable were clamped into place it was important not to leave the hydrogen lamp on for more than 10 minutes so as not to damage it so it was temporarily replaced with a sodium lamp whilst position adjustments were made firstly the telescope was positioned so the source could be seen to be aligned with the crosshair at 0 to the beam it was then rotated through exactly 90 and a mirror inserted into the clamp where the grating would later sit this is exactly what is demonstrated in figure 3. the rotating grating table was then adjusted until the beam could be seen through the eyepiece of the telescope meaning the mirror was at 45 to the beam the turntable could then be rotated through 45 in order for the mirror to be at 90 to the beam at which point it was replaced with the diffraction grating the slit spacing must remain a control variable so the same diffraction grating was used throughout the experiment keeping d constant it was difficult to perceive the lines through the eyepiece at the beginning of the experiment due to background light to try to minimize this problem the main lights were turned off in the laboratory with each desk having its own table lamp which was switched off during observations through the eyepiece light from other desk 's experiments still presented a problem so a piece of black card with a collimator-shaped hole was cut out and stuck round the collimator with blu-tac this proved very effective in blocking out background light once set up the equipment was left clamped in position so only the telescope could be moved this kept the turntable in a fixed positon ensuring the grating remained at the same angle to the beam and the 0 th order emission line remained in the same position the source was then switched back to a hydrogen lamp through the eyepiece we observed emission line spectra of two different colors one blue and one red we concentrated on the sets separately to find two values for the rydberg constant rb and rr respectively blue was taken first the crosshair was lined up with the 0 th order line which was identifiable by the fact that it was both red and blue the reading on the vernier at 0 th order 0 was noted and then the three repeat readings of m were taken one by each of my lab partners and i. this was done in order to spot with a view to remove any personal bias then an average was taken to minimize variation in human judgement of the reading the measurement had to be taken through a magnifying glass as the scale was very small and the light low the range of m was restricted by the lack of accessibility to the eyepiece at larger angles and also the time we had in the laboratory it is interesting to note at this point that the blue lines were separated by less angles than the red which illustrated the proportionality of sin to  as predicted in 2 since blue wavelengths are shorter than red ones after collection of the raw data averages of the three repeat readings were taken in order to find  for each value of m 0 minus m was calculated after the rearrangement of 2 m was plotted against sin for both blue and red light as figure 4 and figure 5 respectively which are shown below in python the of the line of best for of both graphs was obtained the gradient of the blue light emission graph was found to be 25.642 0.650 and the red 19.1730.097 the gradients of the graphs are equal to d λ ⁄ recalling 3 d was calculated to be 1.26910 -5 m 0.06 taking the error in n to be 0.05 lines per mm the gradients of both graphs were then divided by d to obtain values for 1 λ ⁄ 1 λ b ⁄ was found to be 2.02110 6 m -1 which was repeatable because this would give a blue wavelength b of 495nm the range of blue light is 450-495nm 3 and this figure is within the range 1 λ r ⁄ was also repeatable since it was calculated to be 1.51110 6 m -1 which gave a red wavelength r of 662nm also within the accepted range for red light 620-750nm 3 it was given that the two balmer transitions had initial states n=4 and n=3 and final states p=2 2 we can use the idea that the energy of a photon is proportional to the frequency of the photon therefore inversely proportional to its wavelength to decide which color light corresponds to which energy state transition from this we can deduce that the transition from n=4 to p=2 resulted in the blue emission because this is the larger energy state transfer and blue light has the smaller wavelength by elimination the red light was a result of the transition from n=3 to p=2 these values for p and n were then filled into 1 to obtain r ∞ from observations of blue light rb was found to be 1.07810 7 m -1 and from red rr 1.08810 7 m -1 systematic errors were then addressed the computer calculated uncertainty on the gradients and the percentage error in d were added in quadrature to give b of 0.027m -1 and r of 0.006m -1 the percentage error for rr was small only 0.51 whereas that of rb was almost five times larger 2.5 one can see from the positions of the data points relative to the line of best fit in figure 4 that this is due to the presence of more variation with blue light which led to a greater uncertainty in the gradient the gradient errors at first seem large on paper there should not have been much variation in the experiment because there are not many outside factors which could affect the setup moreover the equipment had a very small resolution the vernier measured to a sixtieth of a degree meaning uncertainty in the taking of the readings should have been small however the experiment was conducted in very poor light for reasons mentioned in iii a. which resulted in difficulty with reading the vernier scale even with the use of a magnifying glass we relied on human judgement to deduce where the scale lines up exactly from the raw data you can see that my lab partners and i all thought the scale lined up at slightly different readings this introduced random error the range of  m was only about 9 so any errors in the vernier reading whilst small resulted in a percentage uncertainty which was larger than one would automatically expect furthermore due to the calculation 0 minus m any uncertainty the measurement for  would be double that in also the setting up of the spectrometer had to be done very precisely it is possible we did not take sufficient care in doing this a result of this could be that the grating was not at exactly 90 to the beam i am not sure how this would affect the scattering of the beam further investigation would be needed to confirm if this could have been a source of error there are further errors to consider in this experiment one of which was the fact that the lines in the observed spectra had width although we aligned the center of the crosshair with the line we did not account for the fact that the line had a width resulting in uncertainty in the position of the line and therefore in m i did not have time in the laboratory to investigate the size and implication of this error so have not included it in b or r but would have done so if i had had more time the rydberg constant has the measured value 10,973,731.6m -1 2 let us compare this with our calculated values for r of 10,780,000m -1 270,000 m -1 and 10,880,000 m -1 270,000 m -1 firstly let us establish if our two figures are concurrent with each other taking into account uncertainty the lowest rr could be is 1.08310 7 m -1 and the highest rb could be is 1.10510 7 m -1 the two results are therefore in agreement with each other as they lie within each other 's ranges the measured value for r also lies within the range we calculated in the laboratory although it only lies within the range of the blue emission lines the largest rr could be is 1.09310 7 m -1 rr in contrast was closer to the measured value than rb in the laboratory the rydberg constant has been determined to be in the range of 1.05310 7 m -1 to 1.10510 7 m -1 this is concurrent with the measured value of r which is 10,973,731.6m -1 techniques involving spectroscopic equipment were employed to obtain this range overall this method worked very well once in position the spectroscopy equipment was simple to use and enabled us to make precise measurements also there were only three parameters to measure in this experiment  0  m and n. this kept the magnitude of the systematic uncertainty lower had we allowed more time for the experiment we could have set up the spectrometer to a more exacting standard which would have reduced the uncertainty on measurements taken from the telescope it would also have been useful to use a vernier scale of larger size to enable easier reading and therefore less error due to human judgement if the experiment had been conducted in a separate room the main lights could have been switched on for the reading of the vernier again making the scale easier to read and reducing the error using a desk that is not situated adjacent to a wall therefore allowing access to all angles of the telescope would have enabled us to analyze more orders of the emission line spectra giving us a figure for r closer to the true value alternatively a diffraction grating of smaller n could have been used causing the orders to have smaller angles between them therefore more orders would be seen in the angle range permitted by our setup and more values of m analyzed",superficial,bal
39,GS_BSS487_Redacted,using a hydrogen lamp and a grating spectrometer the rydberg constant was found to be 1.0766e7 ± 3.07e5 m• 1 it was found by measming the angle of diffraction as a function of order m where the phase difference between rays is m21l this allows the w avelengths to be found and a graph of inverse w avelength against 1 1 where n is the initial energy state and p is the final energy state was plotted to find the rydberg constant this allowed an accurate value to be found with the accepted value falling within the error range t he rydberg constant r 00 is the limiting value of the inverse wavelength of any photon emitted from a hydrogen atom its accepted value is l.0973731 568508e7 ± 6.5e-5 m• 1 1 it is used in the rydberg fonnula allowing energies of photons emitted from hydrogen to be calculated it was calculated using a grating spectrometer to find the wavelength of emissions the wavelength could then be used to find the constant by using 3 when an electron moves from a higher energy state to a lower energy state there is a spectral emission when the electron moves between energy states a photon is produced the wavelength of these emitted photons is dependent on which energy levels the electron moves between fig 1 for a grating spectrometer the grating can be considered as n naitow slits that are equally spaced where the separation is d. when the phase difference of emitted rays is 2nm where m is a positive integer a principal maximum will occur for light with wavelength 2 the phase difference can be described by where m is the order number plotting sin0 against m will give a gradient of 1 from which we can calculate a. emitted wavelengths can be calculated using 3 where r 00 is the rydberg constant thus a graph of inverse wavelength against -~ can be plotted giving a we first had to set up the spectrometer fig 2 2 fig 2 ~8 -- -- fig 2 shows the parts of a spectrometer the eyepiece had to be focused on the crosshair so that there would not be eyestrain when taking many measurements the camera then had to be focused to infinity or a distance of over l om this was achieved by focusing on buildings across the road being careful to avoid any parallax betv.•een the crosshair and image the eyepiece and camera telescope where then aligned parallel to the collimator and a sodium lamp was placed close to the slit sodium was used during the set up as hydrogen lamps heat quickly and the colours dim the collimator focus was adjusted until a sharp image of the slit formed on the crosshair the slit was kept ve1y close to the minimum opening during this step and the crosshairs were set to an `` x '' shape using the slow motion drives the slit was positioned at the centre of the crosshair a reading on the vemier scale was taken to move the telescope through 90° and was then clamped in place we placed a miitor on the grating table and tumed the table until we could see a reflected image of the slit this shows that the grating table is aligned at 45° to the collimator the height of the image was then set so that readings could be taken by adjusting the grating table screws taking the reading from the scale again we could move the grating through 45° so that it is perpendicular to the incoming beams from the lamp through the slit we replaced the mirror with a grating avoiding touching the surface and looked through the telescope at spectral lines with a large angle of diffraction to check the grating was correctly orientated on the platform as if it was not the spectral lines will be above or below the plane the crosshair will move in once the set up was finished we replaced the sodium lamp with a hydrogen lamp taking readings we read a reference position from the scale and then looked for diffracted rays of different colours on either side of the central point we lined the crosshair with the centre of the ray and tabulated the readings repeating three times for the three wavelengths we could see the results were then interpreted using python 3. graphing sinθ against m giving a gradient of 𝜆 𝑑 from which we can calculate λ for each ray this allows us to plot a graph of inverse wavelength against reference centre point=216.5°+15arcminutes fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 show the data taken using the spectrometer with a grating of 78.8 lines/mm the gaps in the tables arise from the diffracted ray being too weak to see and so could not be measured from 2 we plotted a graph of sinθ against m. fig 6 shows the graph for the red rays fig 7 shows the graph for blue rays fig 8 shows the graph for purple rays from the graphs plotted in python 3 we could calculate the wavelength for each and the error associated with that value fig 4 second data set fig 5 third data set fig 3 first

parallax error when using the eyepiece or reading the vernier scale poor calibration of the spectrometer light from other sources in the room to allow the rays to be seen the aperture had to be opened to a width that made the centre point of the rays difficult to determine i estimated this as a 10 difference the scale itself has an error of ±1 arcminute however the scale was difficult to read and so a more reasonable associated error with these measurements is ±3 arcminutes the errors in wavelength were calculated using a covariant matrix with these values and 3 we can find the rydberg constant fig 9 shows 1 against inverse wavelength plotted using python 3. the gradient of this graph is equal to -r∞ the constant was found to be equal to 1.0766e7 m -1 the error in this value was found using 4 where 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ is the error in r∞ and 𝜎1 𝜆 is the error in inverse wavelength the value of the error was calculated to be 3.07e5 m -1 this experiment aimed to allow a precise value of the rydberg constant to be calculated the constant can be used to predict energies of emitted photons from atoms using the spectrometer wavelengths for emissions of hydrogen were found by graphing the diffraction of each emission through the grating against the order the change in energy for each specific emission was then graphed against the inverses of the wavelengths this allowed the final value of the rydberg constant to be calculated as 1.0766e7 ± 3.07e5 m -1 this error is less than 3 while the difference between the calculated value and the accepted value of 1.0973731568508e7 is below 2 with more readings taken and being in a dark room isolated the value could be calculated more precisely fig 8 fig 9 fig 9 shows 1 against inverse wavelength 4 fig 8 shows the data points and trend of

40,GS_HBQ145_Redacted,in this experiment we used a grating spectrometer to observe the emission line spectrum of a hydrogen lamp in order to calculate the rydberg constant the spectral lines we observed were part of the balmer series and the diffraction angle for orders 0 to 3 for the colours blue green and red were measured the sine of the angle that the emission lines occurred at was plotted as a function of the order to calculate the corresponding wavelength which enabled us to calculate the rydberg constant for each colour a value for the rydberg constant was calculated the mean value was 1.113000 × 10 7 ± 0.002342 × 10 7 the accepted value is ∼ 1.097373 × 10 7 the percentage error is ≈ 1 however the accepted value lies outside our uncertainty the small uncertainty obtained was due to the small error in the diffraction angle 10 arcminutes and negligible error in the diffraction grating spacing t he hydrogen lamp that we will be using is a thin discharge tube that contains gaseous hydrogen at low temperature applying a high potential difference across the tube excites electrons of the hydrogen atoms 1 so that they are elevated to a higher energy state when the electron transitions back down to a quantised level of lower energy a photon is emitted the energy of the photon is equal to the energy difference between the levels transitioned 2 the hydrogen atoms in our discharge tube will be emitting visible light and we will be using a diffraction grating to split up the light into its constituent wavelengths the resulting series of spectral lines are part of the balmer series 3 and are described by the rydberg formula see theory equation 1 when electrons transition from quantised energy levels n 3 4 5 ... to the energy level of principal quantum number n 2 4 we are observing the balmer lines rather than other lines from other hydrogen spectral series because the balmer lines lie in the visible part of the spectrum in this experiment we will first use the grating spectrometer to measure the angle of diffraction that the colours blue green and red undergo in order to calculate their wavelengths using the grating equation 5 from this a value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h can be obtained as it is known what transition is made by an electron in the hydrogen atom to emit each wavelength of light we are analysing study of the balmer series and therefore use of the rydberg constant has its applications due to the abundance of hydrogen in the universe an example is in astronomy particularly in the classification of stars based on their surface temperature the strength or weakness of spectral lines like those in the balmer series can indicate temperature 6 we are calculating the rydberg constant because of its important role in the rydberg formula which describes the wavelength of light emitted when an electron transitions from a higher energy energy shell to a lower energy shell within the atom this formula is of great importance due to its application and due to its contribution to the development and evolution of the atomic model chemical elements can only absorb and emit photons with quantised wavelengths for many chemical elements these wavelengths are described by the rydberg formula where λ b is the wavelength of the emitted light r ∞ is the rydberg constant and n i and n f are the energy levels or principal quantum numbers of the orbitals occupied by the electron before and after its transition respectively for our hydrogen discharge lamp the resulting series of spectral lines are called the balmer series 7 the balmer lines are the result of the following process firstly an electron in the hydrogen atom absorbs energy in this case supplied from the applied voltage across the tube and according to the bohr model of the atom the energy absorbed by an electron to transition to a higher energy level in this experiment to n 3 4 or 5 must be a multiple of an amount of energy equal to hcr ∞ where h is plank 's constant and c is the speed of light in vacuo 2 and can not be any amount of energy secondly once the electron has absorbed a quantum of sufficient energy it then transitions or `` quantum leaps '' to a higher more unstable orbital n i this is followed by a spontaneous transition to the more stable orbital of principal quantum number n f 2 emitting energy equal to the difference in energy between the two energy levels in the form of a photon 8 the process of an electron transitioning from an excited stated to a lower energy state and in the process emitting a photon is called spontaneous emission other series can be obtained such as the lyman series n f 1 or the paschen series n f 3 2 setting n f 2 the rydberg equation becomes the balmer formula and the constant becomes r h the rydberg constant for hydrogen it can be shown that the rydberg constant for hydrogen can be expressed in terms of other more fundamental constants electron charge e the mass of an electron m e permittivity of free space 0 plank 's constant h and the speed of light in vacuo c in the following equation see appendix a for derivation the resulting value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen is 10973731.6m −1 5 for the emission of a photon of blue light the principal quantum number of an electron in the excited state is n i 5. for green n i 4 and for red n i 3. we will determine with a grating spectrometer and use of the grating equation see equation 3 the wavelengths of the aforementioned colours in the grating spectrometer set-up light from the hydrogen lamp first passes through a slit to make a point source of light the collimator lens makes the light rays parallel so it can then be diffracted through a grating the wave energy spreads out behind the grating because the slit spacing d is comparable in size to the wavelengths of visible light d 78.8 lines per mm the waves that spread out interfere and the result are spectral lines the zeroth order spectral lines occur at a diffraction angle of zero degrees the higher the order spectral line the greater the angle the light has been diffracted through a telescope is moved to locate the various orders and focuses the spectral lines to make a measurement of the diffraction angle θ. if the difference in path to a point some distance away much greater than d between two slits is an integer number m of wavelengths λ the two waves will meet at that point in phase resulting in a maximum a region of constructive interference seen in figure 1 9 the difference in path is also equal to d sin θ the constituent colours have different wavelengths so each corresponding maxima for each colour has a different diffraction angle fig 2 shows the expected intensity of light from a discharge tube akin to the hydrogen lamp we are using as a function of the diffraction angle if only 4 slits are illuminated the large peaks are principal maxima and the smaller peaks are secondary maxima since the intensity of secondary maxima are much less than principal maxima distinct spectral lines are resolved 5 the position of spectral lines occur at angles of 2πm were m is called the order number and is an integer before measurements of the diffraction angle can be made the diffraction grating must be aligned with the collimator first the eyepiece was focused on the cross-hair to eliminate any eye-strain when viewing through it the camera lens was focused using the focus knob see fig 3 7 on a distant object so that the telescope is set up to receive parallel light since light passing through the collimator in the spectrometer will be become parallel a sharp image of the entrance slit attached to the collimator when viewed through the telescope is achieved by adjusting the collimator focus and slit size such that an image of a thin slit is formed at the cross-hair when the telescope is in line with the collimator the telescope is then moved through precisely 90 • using the vernier scale so that it is perpendicular to the axis of the collimator and clamped in position using the telescope rotation lock screw a diffraction grating with slit spacing 78.8 lines per mm was inserted into the mount with rulings vertical like the entrance slit so that the orders produced by the diffraction are horizontally aligned and therefore can be viewed with the telescope the entrance slit is then illuminated with a sodium lamp instead of hydrogen lamp because the hydrogen lamp can overheat and cease to emit light if left on for extended periods of time and the grating and mount is then rotated by the spectrometer table until it reflects light from the collimator into the telescope 10 the slit image is then centred with the cross-hair and fine adjustment knobs since the telescope and collimator are at 90 • the diffraction grating is therefore 45 • to the collimator and telescope the diffraction grating was then rotated precisely through 45 • using the vernier scale so that the plane of the diffraction grating is perpendicular to light from the collimator when switching on the hydrogen lamp with a potential difference of ∼ 5000v across it the prominent colours we could observe up to the 3 rd order were blue green and red background light from lamps in the room limited the number or orders we could see as higher orders above 3 became too faint the diffraction angle θ was measured for orders 0 to 3 by moving the telescope so that the centre of the cross-hair resided on each appropriate spectral line the vernier scale on the spectrometer was accurate to 1 arc minute 7 shows from above the way in which the telescope can be positioned to find the spectral lines so that diffraction angles can be measured when the angle between the normal to the grating and the telescope was 0 • our vernier scale read 209 • and 29 arcminutes we first recorded all the angles then subtracted them from 209 • and 29 arcminutes to correct for the systematic error the sine of the diffraction angle θ in radians was plotted as a function of the order number m. the gradient is equal to sin θ/m and is equal to wavelength of the light divided by the slit spacing λ/d obtained by re-arranging the grating equation equation 3 the gradient multiplied by the slit spacing d is equal to the wavelength of the observed balmer series colours λ b and the principal quantum number n i of the electron before the spontaneous emission is 5 4 and 3 for blue green and red respectively the value for r h is hence calculated for each wavelength by using equation 1. spectral lines have some thickness and are not infinitely sharp therefore there is an uncertainty associated with the diffraction angle spectral lines have this thickness because the atoms emitting the light are moving relative to the observer and the energy levels can not be defined to exceedingly high or infinite precision due to heisenberg 's uncertainty principle see appendix b 13 the angle was measured to the left and right of the first order blue spectral line we measured this angle to be 10 arcminutes the error in 1 d is assumed to be negligible and the error in the diffraction angle was assumed to be fixed at 10 arcminutes the error in the gradient is calculated by finding the first entry in the covariance matrix for the data for each colour this is done in the computer programming language python figures 5 -7 show the plots for each colour observed in the hydrogen balmer series using the corrected angles where a reading of 209 • and 29 arcminutes corresponds to 0 • between the normal to the diffraction grating and telescope the vertical error bars are very small for each plot as the spectral lines are thin resulting in a small error in the diffraction angle another factor that contributed to small vertical error bars is the high accuracy of the vernier scale to the nearest 1 arcminute the plot for blue light resulted in the greatest error for r h an order of magnitude greater than for green and red see table i a source of random error entered the experiment as the markings of the vernier scale were difficult to see and sometimes there was ambiguity as to which of the markings lined up indicating the minutes of arc the ambiguity if there was any was always with neighbouring markings i estimate this error in diffraction angle to be 2 arcminutes as the uncertainty was never more than two divisions to the left or to the right of the marking we chose to be lined up adding this to the uncertainty due to the assumed thicknesses of the spectral lines 10 arcminutes the resulting error is 12 arcminutes in the diffraction angle however because 2 arcminutes is quite a small error in comparison to 10 arcminutes the error in the gradient and error bars have not changed noticeably when introduced an improved way of accounting for this random error which by definition changed for each measurement is to note down after each reading which marking could also be lined up then the angle recorded would be the mean of the angles half-way between the smallest and greatest angle because the ambiguity existed between neighbouring markings and the uncertainty would be half the difference between the greatest and smallest potential diffraction angle there are no horizontal error bars because the principal maxima were discrete and countable table i below displays the results using the gradients of figures 5 -7 and equation 3 to calculate the wavelengths λ b table i also shows the values of r h calculated using the rydberg formula equation 1 setting n f 2 for each colour the error is denoted by σ with a subscript to denote the quantity that the error is associated with and superscript with the colour it is associated with for example σ blue r h is the error in the value r h that was calculated with blue light the percentage error in the calculated value of r h for blue the error in our mean value for r h constitutes a possible variation in the mean of less than 1 ≈0.87 this error is small because the error in the diffraction angle measured was very small 12 arcminutes including the estimated random error which was assumed to be fixed but may have changed and no other errors were considered as the error in the lines per mm of the diffraction grating was assumed to be negligible the percentage error in the mean r h is 1.42 however the accepted theoretical value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen lies outside our uncertainty a possible source of systematic error that may have contributed to the overall increase in our value for the mean r h may include incorrect calibration when aligning the diffraction grating this is unlikely to be the main source of error because the value for r h when using blue light is less than the accepted value this means the primary source of error is likely to be random error the aim of the experiment was to calculate rydberg constant for hydrogen by taking measurements of the hydrogen balmer series using a grating spectrometer to do this light from a hydrogen lamp was made parallel and passed through a diffraction grating each colour in the balmer series blue green and red diffracted by different angles which was measured and the sine of the angle was plotted as a function of the order of the spectral line we then calculated three values for the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each colour using the gradients of the plots our mean value for r h was 1.113000×10 7 ± 2.342×10 4 the mean differs by ≈ 1 of the actual accepted value 109737321.568508 which lies outside our uncertainty an improvement to our experiment would be to measure the diffraction angle to higher orders which would reduce the error in the gradient in order to achieve this we would have to perform the experiment in a darker room with no lamps so that higher orders for all colours are made visible a poor assumption was also made that the error in the diffraction angle was fixed however an improvement would be to measure the thickness of each of the spectral lines another improvement would be to measure diffraction angle spectral orders going in the negative direction this would enable us to calculate more values for r h thus reducing the effect of random error appendix a derivation of the rydberg formula 13 14 using niels bohr 's picture of the atom we consider an electron orbiting a proton where the centripetal and coulomb forces equate the quantity r is the radius of the electron 's orbit and v is the tangential velocity of the electron bohr postulated that the angular momentum l m e vr was an integer number n of using equations 4 and 5 we can solve for r and v r 0 n 2 h 2 e 2 m e π and v 1 the total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy k e with a little simplification the integer n is the principal quantum number which describes the radius and therefore energy of the orbit the electron is in when an electron transitions from one orbit of energy e i at quantum number n n i to another energy of e f at n n f the change in energy ∆e is e f − e i which is the spontaneous transition of an electron from an excited state to a lower energy state emits a photon with energy equal to ∆e since the energy e of a photon is given by hc λ where lambda is the wavelength of the photon we can substitute ∆e e into equation 7 hence obtaining the rydberg formula where the constant terms together is the rydberg constant the uncertainty principle in terms of the energy e of the excited state and the time interval ∆t for the transition to the ground state 15 is approximately given by ∆e∆t ∼ h 10 where h h 2π 11 using equation 10 a photon of energy e hf where f is the frequency emitted in this transition will have a range of frequencies ∆f this range of possible frequencies results in what is called natural broadening 11,extended,the
41,GS_YCF820_Redacted,"the rydberg constant is a good approximation for the energy of hydrogen in ground state it is also utilised in spectroscopy as it precisely predicts the balmer series the rydberg constant was obtained via a spectrometer and equation ii.2 this apparatus was used to take reference angles of spectral lines and plot a graph of sin 𝜽 as a function of order the gradient was utilised in the rydberg formula to produce a value of 10989388.37𝐦 −𝟏 this calculated figure is 0.1 from the accepted value and is deemed to be of a high degree of precision he investigation involved the measurement of the balmer series of the hydrogen spectrum and produced data which accurately deduced the rydberg constant r the rydberg constant is the wavenumber of a photon with the minimum energy needed to ionise a hydrogen atom from ground state the constant can be derived from other fundamental constants found in the bohr model the value of r is used in the rydberg formula which describes the wavelength of all elemental spectral lines the two main spectra seen in the first investigation are continuous and emission a heated tungsten filament can emit spectra where the intensity varies as a function of wavelength this is known as a continuous spectrum hot and electrically excited gasses produce emission line spectra which is characterised by the appearance of slits of defined wavelengths on the spectrometer when current passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas the electrons become excited and move to a higher energy level when they return to their original energy state they emit a photon of corresponding energy the spectrum of light can be analysed using a spectrometer which consists of three key instruments see figure iii.1 light from the source passes through the slit into the lens which collimates the light rays a diffraction grating is utilised to disperse the light into a spectrum this spectrum is then focused and aligned onto the crosshair by employing an eyepiece the apparatus was employed as it is precise with the scale being graduated in arcminutes the differences in intensities of the spectral lines in a spectrum can be used to determine the temperature of the gas whilst examining the line widths can provide information regarding the density of the gas a diffraction grating is comprised of many narrowly spaced parallel slits the separation between the centre of each slit is d. for light rays of wavelength λ minima can be observed when the phase difference is an odd integer multiple of π e.g π 3π maxima occur when the phase difference is an even integer multiple of π e.g 2π 4π the phase difference is therefore where m is the order number the path difference can be written as dsinθ as shown in figure iii.1 so the equation can be simplified to the phase angle of the first minimum can be calculated with the equation where n represents the number of slits the resolving power is the minimum distance between two points so that they can be distinguished the minima of one diffraction pattern occurs at the same position as the maxima of a second diffraction pattern as shown in the m th maxima occurs at an angle θ 2 so that the minimum angle is defined as the intensity at the midpoint of two equal lines is therefore 20 less than the intensity at the peak meaning that the two lines are distinct from one another the formula for the wavelength of a photon emitted from a hydrogen atom as an transitions between energy states is where p is the final energy state and n is the initial energy state both of which are integers specifically for the balmer series in hydrogen p=2 and n=3,4,5 when an electron drops from energy level n to 2 it produces a photon of a specific wavelength in the visible spectrum the colour of light emitted can be determined using equation ii.8 and a colour chart light from the source e.g a hydrogen lamp passed through the narrow slit whose width could be adjusted depending on light intensity as the light rays passed through the collimator they became parallel the light then passed through the camera lens onto the crosshair where the image was magnified via the eyepiece the eyepiece was focused onto the cross wire at a viewing distance of 25cm so that eyestrain was reduced whilst taking measurements the camera lens was aligned so that an object 10m away was focused onto the cross wire this ensured that parallax error was minimised the telescope was aligned with the centre line of the collimator and a sodium lamp was positioned with respect to the slit a sodium lamp was used in setup rather than a hydrogen lamp as the latter would overheat after short periods of time and switch off the focus of the collimator was then adjusted so that an image of the slit was aligned with the cross wire this was completed without adjusting the camera focus the demonstrator recommended rotating the cross wire to form a × rather than a as this meant that slit was easily visible the slow-motion drive and clamp screw were tuned and final adjustments were made to the camera and collimator the telescope was rotated 90 degrees and clamped into position a 300-slit grating was placed into the holder and a ruler was used to ensure it was vertical the grating table was rotated until the diffraction grating was at a 45-degree angle from the incident light ray an initial observation of the position of the slit 's reflected image in the telescope was made and the height of the image was altered via the adjustment screw beneath the grating table readings on both scales the main scale which was graduated in degrees and the secondary scale which was graduated in arcminutes were taken and the grating was then moved through 45 degrees ensuring that the eyepiece was situated at 0 degrees to the incident light ray the telescope was repositioned temporarily so approximate positions of the spectral lines could be noted the telescope was then revolved so that diffracted images of the slit could be observed for different orders e.g -2 -1 0 1 2. the error recorded on the results for the setup of the sodium lamp were 0.5 degrees and 1 arcminute these values were based on the scale 's precision the errors also consider differences between experimenter 1 's and experimenter 2 's readings table 1 illustrates the initial measurements made when setting up the sodium lamp the preliminary results for the setup of the experiment shown in table i were not usable as the eyepiece was not focused on the same maxima this meant that the reference angle was not suitable for taking results the uncertainty in the preliminary and final results were close to negligible as the percentage uncertainties were in the magnitude of 1 × 10 −3 for both the preliminary and final results a sodium lamp was substituted for a hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp was switched off when not in use to prevent overheating final adjustments were made to the slit size before measurements were taken to ensure optimum intensity and resolution preliminary results were then recorded for each transition wavelength θ was measured against both positive and negative orders some data values in the table have been replaced by n/a which signifies that the reference angle for that order could not be obtained this was primarily due to light pollution from other lamps meaning that it was difficult to identify fringe lines as the order m increases from -2 to 2 the reference angle decreases equation ii.2 implies that if sin θ was plotted against the order m it will produce a linear relationship table iv the data for the reference angles is an average of the two-data set produced by the experimenters the results were taken between order -2 and 2 where the range of the angle for red was from 168.42º to 215.03º the range for blue was from 176.94º to 207.12º and the range for purple was from 175.06º to 208.09º the final measurements follows the same general relationship as the preliminary measurements however the decrease in the reference angle becomes more consistent diminishing by approximately 12º for red 8º for blue and 8º for purple whereas in the preliminary investigation the reference angle decreased by varying amounts the main source of uncertainty with the results was due to parallax error an attempt to resolve this was made by taking readings when level with the scale another source of error was due to the thickness of the fringe consequently all measurements were taken in the centre of the fringe random errors arose as it was difficult to see the cross in the dark and so the fringe was not consistently aligned this was resolved by periodically turning on the lamp to check alignment other potential sources of systematic error were air pressure humidity and occasional defocus of the telescope both air pressure and humidity remained roughly constant during the investigation hence it was unnecessary to account for these variables moreover the defocus of the telescope was temporary and so was not problematic as with the error in the setup of the sodium lamp the percentage uncertainty in the reference angle was very small in the order of 1 × 10 −3 the percentage error in the gradient is very small in the order of 1 × 10 −2 for red and 1 × 10 −3 for purple this is due to the small y error bars and the lack of anomalous points in figure i. however the error in the y-intercept is very large as the percentage error has a magnitude of 1 × 10 2 this is as the y-intercept is small whilst the absolute errors have remained roughly constant however the percentage error in the yintercept is unimportant as it is not used in calculating the rydberg constant a 300-slit grating was used so d is equal to 3.33 × 10 −6 m. using equation ii.8 the values of d and the gradient the calculated rydberg constant is 10989388.37m −1 the error in this number can be calculated by using the equation where σ x is the error in the gradient of red 0.003. this produces a figure of 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 see algebraic manipulation for both values in lab book the primary aim of the investigation was to measure the spectrum of hydrogen and to obtain an accurate value for the rydberg constant the secondary aim was to obtain an error of magnitude of less than 1 × 10 −3 the method involved making observations of the spectral lines through the telescope the value of the reference angle on both the main and secondary scale was noted a graph was produced of sin θ against order m and a gradient was determined from this the rydberg constant was obtained the successes of the investigation were determining a value of the rydberg constant within one thousandth of the accepted value and producing a graph with no observable anomalies and a percentage error less than one percent the main failure of the experiment was producing an error of magnitude 1 × 10 −2 which came into conflict with the secondary aim the key achievements of the experiment were obtaining a strong positive correlation for the linear plot for figure i and producing strong data analysis consisting of errors in both the gradient and y-intercept one improvement to the experimental method would be monitoring the environmental factors such as humidity and air pressure",extended,bal
42,GS_GYI981_Redacted,constant for all wavelengths were relatively small around 2 for each meaning the results are reliable the linear relationship between the sine of the diffraction angle and order was proved graphically for all of the colours of light produced by hydrogen so the method was successful in proving the theory needed to calculate the wavelength of the diffracted light to improve the experiment i would have carried out the method in a darkened isolated room where only one experiment was occurring at a time ensuring that there were as little external sources of light as possible this would have been beneficial as with external sources light it was difficult to see the spectral lines produced by the diffraction grating and therefore it was a challenge to align the crosshair onto the centre of the spectral line by doing this the uncertainty in the alignment would have decreased and consequently the overall uncertainty in the calculated value for the rydberg constant would have been smaller increasing the reliability of the results another way to improve the experiment would be to take repeat readings of the angle of diffraction by for example both my lab partner and i taking a reading of the scale for each spectral line this way a mean value could be calculated as well as the uncertainty in the angle this experiment has verified that the experimental set-up is capable of measuring to a high accuracy by using data taken from the set-up to calculate a known value to an acceptable degree of accuracy with small uncertainties within which the known accepted value lies,extended,bal
