potential the kinetic energy of electron respectively 5 since the energy of a photon emit by a hydrogen atom be give by the difference of two hydrogen energy level where n and m be positive integer and n be great than m. from the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a photon 𝜈 𝑐 𝜆 2.9 where c be the speed of light eq 6 can be rewrite a for hydrogen atom the atomic number z be 1. therefore the rydberg constant be define a in this experiment we experimentally measure the rydberg constant if hydrogen gas be heat or electrically charge the electron in the atom be excite and the add energy push the electron to high energy orbitals when the electron fall back to their original position the add energy be re-emitted in the form of photon and the wavelength of the photon be determine by the differnece in energy between the orbitals a show in where m can be call the order number we set up the spectrometer a show in fig 3.1 use a collimator a grate and a camera with a crosshair and ensure that they be in parallel the beam of photon from the light source be diffract by the grate so we set the angular position of the camera when they be parallel a an origin and rotate it until a light fringe be observe then we measure the angle of diffraction by measure the change in angle from the origin use a vernier we repeat this with a many other fringe a possible and statisticised the result to find the rydberg constant although the rydberg constant obtain from the experiment be reasonably close to the theoretical value the uncertainty of the constant be unacceptably huge and we found that there be various reason that affected our value since the room be dark and it be hard to read the cramped number on the veriner the angle of diffraction could be measure imprecisely we conclude that this be the major factor that affected the inaccurate rydberg constant we found that the major uncertainty emerge in consequence of the wide slit size since this cause the thicker width of the light fringe this could be improve by use a narrow slit there could be various systematic error that affected the result we try to perfectly align the spectrometer but this could be unsuccessful also the position of the lamp should have be a close to the slit a possible since it be directly related to the intensity of the light this could make u see the cyan colour light the air pressure and humidity be also other source but we decide that they be negligible there be background light which be inevitably require to measure the angle of diffraction we thought this could be the reason why the cyan colour of light and the 3 rd order light fringe of red and violet light be not detect and test without any light but we still could not see the line in the experiment we try to measure the rydberg constant use a hydrogen gas tube and a spectrometer and we get 𝑅 ∞ 10.5 × 10 6 ± 4.4 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 which be only 0.4 unit less than the theoretical value however we fail to obtain the precise value a our uncertainty be over 40 percent of our value and we conclude that the width of the slit be not narrow enough to produce the precise result this could be improve by repeat the experiment in a darker room with a narrower slit width and a clearer vernier a for reference this be the code that have be use for data analysis\"\n"," \"he aim of this experiment be to determine a value for the wavelength of the emission spectrum of several different compound this be do by burning the compound use initially a candle but later on a butane blowtorch to excite the electron to a high energy shell which lead to them lose their energy in the form of a photon a they transition back down to a low energy state the wavelength of this light be measure use a grate spectrometer the two compound that we will be use be licl and cuso 4 these compound be not the only one that we attempt to determine the wavelength of however we could not excite the electron with either the blowtorch or the candle so we do not find a value for the wavelength of these compound the grate will measure the angle between the different slit of light from the emission spectrum the experiment rest upon the idea that a diffraction grate will turn a beam of light of the same wavelength into several maximum and minimum due to interference of the light wave from this and the knowledge of distance between the grate we can calculate the wavelength of the slit from which we can calculate which transition between orbitals the light represent when a compound be heat the electron within the atom of that compound be excite meaning they now have more energy consequently they will transition from a low energy orbital to one of high energy 3 the energy that the electron have absorbed be exactly equal to the energy of the high orbital minus the energy of the low orbital eventually the electron de-excite meaning that they transition back to a low energy orbital they then release the excess energy a a photon of light with a wavelength 𝜆 correspond to that energy this be express in equation 2.1 a well a be show in figure 1. where h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light in m/s the energy of the high energy orbital and the low energy orbital be specific to the compound meaning that specific wavelength will be observe from the emission spectrum of different compound the diffraction grate be make up of a large number of narrow slit that be equally space it have n slit with a slit separation d 5 a maximum will occur when the phase difference between two adjacent ray be 2𝜋𝑚 with m be determine wavelength of emission spectrum use a grate spectrometer t an integer represent the order of the slit consequently we have equation 2.2. a path difference be equal to 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 where 𝜃 be the angle between the central maximum and the maximum we be measure we arrive at equation 2.3. 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 𝑚𝜆 2.3 this equation allows u to relate the angle of the maximum to the wavelength of the emission spectrum the maximum and minimum be show in figure 2 6 the maximum number of order produce be found when we take 𝜃 𝜋 2 this be because the large diffraction angle that we can have from a grate that be perpendicular to the light ray be use si for all unit we set up the equipment a show in figure 3. we have a choice of several diffraction grate with different quantity of line per mm we decide to use the low line per mm diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm this be because this grate will produce the slit a close a we can get them this be because for this grate d be the high value if we look at equation 2.3 we can see that this will give u a small value of 𝜃 for a give value of m. equation 2.4 show u that for this big value of d we will have a large number of order m that will be visible the light come from the burning compound it then pas through the narrow slit after which it be make parallel by the collimate lens the parallel light then hit the grate at normal incidence where it be diffract this light be then focus by the camera lens onto the crosshair at the point x. the eyepiece can be use to view the magnify image we make sure to adjust the slit and the end of the collimator to ensure that all of the diffraction slit be thin meaning that it be easy to determine their angle from the central fringe this also help ensure that the excess light not from the compound be more easily distinguishable from the fringe we decide not to take too much time make sure the central fringe be at 0 degree instead we take the value that the central fringe be at and then subtract this from all of the measurement to essentially make this the zero point this method be just a precise a calibrate the spectrometer to 0 degree this be do in order to save time so that we could take more measurement this process be show in appendix a and b. measurement be take by look through the eyepiece and line up the lens to align with one of the slit we then use the protractor attach to the side of the spectrometer to measure the angle that the lens be at this be then repeat for all of the slit that be visible to u in order for the slit to be easily distinguish we do the experiment in almost complete darkness in order to produce the emission spectrum that we need to carry out the experiment we have to burn the compound we be initially instruct to use a candle to burn the compound and produce the light when this method be try however we encounter a few problem the first be that the candle flame do n't appear to be hot enough 8 to produce the number of photon need to make the measurement the second problem be if any photon be be produce they be not noticeable due to the large amount of light produce from the candle itself to alleviate this issue we decide to use a butane blowtorch a it be much hotter than a candle flame 9 a well a the flame be less bright in order to use the blowtorch we place the compound into a metal bowl with some candle wax inside the wax be there a we found that the compound burn much brighter when they be mixed with the wax make it easy to carry out our experiment we then aim the torch downwards towards the compound a it be turn on this produce lot of colour light which we be able to analyse through the eyepiece these measurement have to be take relatively quickly a we found that if the compound burn for too long the candle wax would start to boil spit at u therefore make it unsafe to work the data that we gather from the method be summarise in table 1 and table 2. we observe the light from the licl to be red and the light from the cuso 4 to be green this be all do in python for this reason we take the sine of all the value we have record then plot this data against m on a graph a be show in figure 4 and 5. the error bar be a combination of the error due to the equipment add to the error due to the width of the slit meaning the angle measurement have a range these error be add in quadrature for fig 4 we have a gradient of 0.05637. this be calculate in python by use the polyfit function that be part of the scipy package use the covariance matrix in python we calculate that the uncertainty in the graph be ±0.0005044 this uncertainty be very small in relation to the value for the gradient this be because the point on the graph all give a very similar value for wavelength so they all line up on the graph use equation 4.1 we can see that in order to find the wavelength we multiply the value for the gradient by the distance in between each line on the grate a the grate have 78.8 line per mm we calculate that the distance between each slit be 0.0000127m we can multiply this by the gradient to find that the wavelength for photon emit from licl to be 6.82 × 10 −7 ± 8 × 10 −9 m. it be obvious that the error in cuso 4 be big than the error in licl this be partially due to have less data point for the cuso 4 than the licl this be because the after the 1 st order maximum the 2 nd order maximum be too faint to be distinguish from the background light which be mainly be produce by the blowtorch from do this experiment we notice several area for improvement both the candle and the blowtorch both give wide spectrum from their own light consequently the slit of light be much less well define meaning that it be much more difficult to measure the angle another issue be that due to have to use a small aluminium container with wax in it meant we could only burn the compound for a short amount of time after a short duration of the blow torch be on the container would start to melt this be due to the melt point of aluminium be low than the temperature of the torch 10 the setup we use also meant that the light tend to flicker a we be heating the compound this also make it far more difficult to take precise measurement in order to solve all of these problem if we be to repeat the experiment we would use the follow setup to heat the compound a bunsen burner would be setup and set to a blue flame a metal scalpel would be use to scoop up the compound and place it into the flame release photon this mean we would only have to stop each measurement when all of the compound be burn this be a definite improvement a we would have a consistent way to burn the compound get rid of some of the flicker that we previously experienced it will also mean that we would have longer to take our measurement for the angle meaning that our value will likely be more accurate a we will not have to rush in conclusion the value of the wavelength for photon emit from licl be 𝜆 682 × 10 −7 ± 800 × 10 −7 m the value for the wavelength of the photon emit from cuso 4 be 𝜆 5.43 × 10 −7 ± 4.5 × 10 −8 m neither of the value for the wavelength that we have determine through our experiment agree with the accepted value for wavelength of the photon emit from the compound there be a percentage difference of 3 for licl and 11 for cuso 4 from the accepted value in order to gain more accurate value for the wavelength we would repeat the experiment again make the change that i suggest in part v of this report\"\n"," \"the rydberg constant be one of the most important constant in atomic physic due to it relation to other fundamental constant and because of the high level of accuracy to which it be possible to determine it value this experiment aim to use a grate spectrometer to accurately measure this constant by observe the emission spectrum produce by a hydrogen discharge lamp and measure the diffraction angle of the different spectral line use these to calculate their wavelength and then rydberg 's constant use the rydberg formula the value achieve by this method be 11030000 m -1 with an uncertainty of ± 4000 m -1 this place the result 14 σ away from the accepted value of 10973731 m -1 hen excite to high energy state all atom produce emission spectrum due to the transition of the atom 's electron from high to low energy level emit energetic photon a they do so these spectrum be unique to every element in accordance with the unique energy level available to the electron for occupation 1 study these spectral line have have an impact on a wide range of area in physic observe their position allows u to measure the distance and relative velocity of distant galaxy or the elemental composition of star 2 develop both the theoretical understand of these spectrum and the method to measure them then have be instrumental in progress scientific theory and knowledge of our universe central to this theoretical appreciation of atomic spectrum be the rydberg constant this constant describes the wavelength of light in the atomic spectrum relate them to the transition of electron result in the photon 's emission although discover by balmer and rydberg empirically it be the theoretical work by bohr which follow that give rydberg 's constant it real significance bohr prove that the constant be in fact a fundamental one by express it in term of other atomic fundamental see the next section -theory 3 amongst these constant be the fine structure constant α. this relation have lead to the rydberg constant have great importance in the field of quantum electrodynamics or qed the fine structure constant be central to qed a it be a measure of the electromagnetic couple strength at low energy 4 the rydberg constant can be determine with an extremely high level of accuracy 3 and a such enables great calculation of other fundamental constant especially in this case α. calculate constant to high degree of accuracy be often the best test for theory a have be the case for qed and allows much great theoretical prediction a such due to progress make measure rydberg 's constant qed be often consider the most accurate theory in modern science 5 this experiment aim to determine the value of rydberg 's constant use grate spectroscopic method the setup result and error analysis be all present a well a a critical analysis of the method and potential improvement a grate can be consider a large number of small equally space slit with a separation d. light passing through a grate form a diffraction pattern of maximum if the wavelength of the light be λ maximum occur where the phase difference between light wave come from the different slit be an integer m of 2π at this point the wave be in phase at the same relative position in their oscillatory cycle and constructive interference occurs in other word the light wave sum to produce brighter patch the path difference between two wave be the physical difference in distance that the wave have travel and be give by dsinθ a show in figure 1 where θ be the angle the light make with the grate the phase difference can be define in term of the path difference a therefore by substitute the requirement for the phase difference and the result found for the path difference and hence this be know a the grate equation unlike with simple two slit interference pattern the great number of slit in a grate mean that the maximum be much more distinct and separate by large area of darkness at all point other than determine rydberg 's constant by observe the emission spectrum of a hydrogen discharge lamp use a grate spectrometer w 3 the collimator be then focus so that a clear image be visible on the cross hair of the eyepiece in the telescope a minimum slit width be use to make sure the focus be good a large beam have less define edge make identify the point of focus more difficult the telescope be line up with the beam accurately use the fine motion knob the value read on the vernier scale at this position be record a this be the zero position about which other measurement be reference the telescope be then rotate exactly 90° measure use the vernier scale before place a grate of 80 line mm -1 in the holder the grate table be rotate so that a reflect image of the light beam be visible and align in the telescopeindicating a rotation of the grate of exactly 45° use the scale the grate be then rotate 45° these step ensure the grate be accurately set at an angle of 0° or normal to the collimator the sodium lamp be swap for the hydrogen lamp be use to take measurement the lamp be place a close to the slit at the end of the collimator a possible to reduce the amount of background light enter the system a possible the experiment be conduct in a dark laboratory however the lamp of colleague could still provide external light which have the potential to interfere with the diffraction pattern and the spectrum observe it be decide that both student would take measurement of the position of the maximum a this would help identify the human difference in reading the vernier scale and account for them in a statistical error four set of reading be take in total the telescope be move around the grate bed align with the spectral line accurately use the fine motion knob on the bed and the angle be read off the vernier scale in order to calculate the value of θ a label in figure 2 the zero position reading be subtract from the reading on the scale at the position of the line the angular position be record a a function of order for each of the three different colour spectral line visible red blue and violet because hydrogen lamp overheat and reduce in efficiency after extend use the discharge lamp be turn on whilst the telescope be move into position and secure and then turn off whilst the reading be take from the vernier scale this prevent the lamp from overheat and have to wait for it to cool there be some difficulty in accurately align the telescope with the centre of the high order maximum due to how faint they be in order to try and overcome this shield be use to block out a much background light a possible from the entire setup to provide a great contrast between the spectral line and the dark background reduce the error repeat the reading also aim to reduce the effect of this error in the case of the violet line the third order maximum be not always possible to see the experiment be complete over two week and during the first session the negative third order be not visible and in the second session the positive third order be not visible this be despite all condition and equipment be maintain a similar a possible this do mean that some data be collect for both positive and negative high order however only two reading be make rather than the four achieve for the rest of the colour and order before take result the slit width on the collimator be adjust so that high order maximum in the diffraction pattern be visible by widen the slit and allow more light to pa through however the slit could not be so wide that the beam be too large and undefined a this would add uncertainty to the measurement of their position at this point the diffraction grate be change from 80 line per mm to 300 line per mm a by consider equation 3 it be clear that a small gap between line a small value of d lead to a large angle between order a both m and λ remain constant the effect of this be to reduce the relative error in the measurement of the position the graph below show the average of the data collect for each colour line at each order where negative order and angle correspond to those in the direction define previously the error bar include on the plot have be calculate use the range of the data discussion of why this method be chosen follow later the error bar prove so small they be unclear on figure 3 so an example point be show in figure 4. linear trend line have be calculate use the least square method weight by the inverse of the error of each data point and plot on the graph a can be see from 3 the gradient of a line be 𝜆 𝑑 where d be know to be 3.33 × 10 −6 therefore the wavelength correspond to the light form the three different spectral line can be found these be found to be 653nm for red 483nm for blue and 432nm for the violet line use external resource 7 these wavelength be related to the electron transition produce these photon so the value of n in equation 4 be know the value of p be know to be 2 a this defines the balmer series therefore substitute in the related value of λ and n provide three value of the rydberg constant the mean average of these be take to produce the final result of 11030000 m -1 figure 3 -the sine of the angle to different order diffraction maximum for the red blue and violet spectral line from 3 the gradient of the line be 𝜆 𝑑 and the wavelength of the spectral line be found to be 653nm 483nm and 432nm respectively order e.g +1 and -1 +2 and -2 etc and checked that they be exactly the same a they should be if the grate be perfectly orthogonal to the incident light despite the angle in the result be similar they could have be even more accurate and this may have reduce the inaccuracy of the experiment there be other factor in the laboratory that be uncontrollable and would have have an effect on the accuracy of the experiment the air condition such a pressure temperature and importantly how they vary be not strictly control beyond the fact that the experiment be complete in the same lab for the two session vary pressure and temperature result in a change refractive index of the air which affect the path of the light travel through it and would change the angle record 8 although this effect be consider to be too small to have a significant effect during the practical procedure if the setup could be modify to be conduct in a vacuum any potential effect from the air would be remove\"\n"," \"in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the apparatus be already assemble my lab partner and i only have to do the calibration the diffraction grate in the experiment have 300 line per millimeter by analyze the data for interference line of each colour separately one can find it wavelength by relate the found wavelength to the appropriate change in energy level it be possible to find the rydberg constant use this method it be found that the value of the constant be 1.099 × 10 7 ± 2 × 10 4 𝑚 −1 the only great problem in this experiment be that there be probably light come from an outside source which we fail to distinguish from the hydrogen spectrum when measurement be take the main aim of this experiment be to obtain the rydberg constant while also learn how to use a grate spectrometer with the use of a spectrometer one can study the spectrum of light 1 this allows u to thereby deduce some property of luminous object or substance a grate spectrometer disperses light with a grate in which the slit be equally separate this produce an interference pattern which depends on the wavelength of the disperse light and on the distance between the several slit in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the observe interference pattern allow u to deduce the wavelength of photon which be produce by different transition between energy level in the hydrogen atom by relate the wavelength to the appropriate transition one can derive the rydberg constant and it uncertainty the grate be make of many slit which create an interference pattern for light of wavelength \\uf06c the constructive interference will occur at 1 where 𝛩 be the angle at which the interference line be observe d be the distance between the slit and m be the order number an integer by find several angle at which interference occurs we can therefore accurately find also the wavelength of light furthermore the mention wavelength depends on the energy of the photon which be also the energy release by an atom make a transition from one energy level to another the wavelength be related to the transition between energy level by the rydberg equation 1 where r ∞ be rydberg 's constant n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level in our experiment we could only observe visible light which be part of the balmer series the balmer series be know to be create when atom drop down to the second energy level from any high energy level 1 hence we know that p will always be 2 for our case the n related to each wavelength will be guess by use our previous knowledge of how the colour of observe light be connect to the energy carry by photon by use 1 to find the wavelength and then substitute them into 2 while make reasonable guess of n we can therefore derive the rydberg constant the grate spectrometer we use consists of a collimator a table with a grate holder a camera and an eyepiece although we be give a function grate spectrometer my lab partner and i have to calibrate the instrument during calibration we use a sodium lamp a the light source since the hydrogen lamp overheats quickly we focus the eyepiece at a convenient view distance to minimize eye strain both my lab partner and i have to agree on the calibration since we want to take measurement independently crosschecking our data and thereby make sure that we do not make a mistake while reading the angle on the scale or align interference line with the cross wire in the eyepiece then we have to focus the camera lens on a point far away since the light from our source be collimate similar to light from a distant object this be do by point the camera across the room the object that we point it at be approximately 15 meter away and focus it in such a way that there be no parallax between the see image and the cross wire the camera have to point directly at the collimator to achieve this the camera be rotate by 90 degree so that it be at a right angle with respect to the collimator a mirror be place in the holder for the grate slight adjustment be make to position of the mirror until the reflect light be align with the cross wire this meant that the mirror be form an angle of 45 degree with both the collimator orientation and the camera orientation by rotate the camera back by 90 degree and the table with the holder by 45 degree the camera be point directly at the collimator and the grate would be perpendicular to their orientation the mention part be then clamped into position we also have to set the right height of the grate by take a quick look at the interference line we notice that the one at great angle be dimmer and be above the centre of the cross wire we use three screw in the table to adjust the height and orientation the table could be tilt because there be three screw so that the grate be not tilt and we could clearly see all the interference line when the setup be complete the sodium lamp be replace with the hydrogen lamp and we start take measurement a grate with 300 slit per mm be use in table 1 we can see all the interference line at what angle they occur and their colour we initially estimate the error for each measurement base on the difference between our record and the width of the interference line which be approximately 2 arcminute most of the error be in the range of 3 to 6 arcminute however there be some measurement be the uncertainty range do not cover the same value a the measurement on the opposite side with the opposite order number since this indicate that the error estimation have to be too small i decide to increase the error associate with the two measurement these error get large than i hop but fortunately there be at least three measurement for each colour that be quite accurate because the wavelength be calculate from the slope of the graph the error of the wavelength be not too large since the accurate measurement determine the slope to a great extent the wavelength of each colour be determine by plot a sin θ versus order number m. the error of sin θ be obtain by use the fact that at first i plot the sin θ versus order number line for all the colour on the same graph in python fig 2 but i also want to find the uncertainty of each slope since this be rather inconvenient in python i decide to use logger pro to find the minimum and maximum slope this method be show in appendix a. from 1 we can deduce that where k be the slope of the graph for one of the colour 𝜆 be the wavelength of light of that colour and d the distance between two slit the diffraction grate use in our experiment have 300 slit per millimeter with no uncertainty state i estimate it to be 0.5 of a slit per millimeter since otherwise the grate would have a different slit per unit length number state on it 2 we can see that all the wavelength match the true value except the wavelength for green light do not but there be a slight deviation of the mean value this might be due to systematic error most noticeable be the fact that the central line be not at exactly 0 degree but at 3 arcminute this indicates that the diffraction grate be not perfectly perpendicular although the angle by which it be deviate be small this could have cause a great change in the angle at which the interference pattern occur the green colour be not even close to any of the wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum and there be also quite large deviation of the data point from the best fit line most likely cause for it occurrence be that there be another element with hydrogen in the same lamp or that it occur because of another light source i be more inclined towards the latter explanation because it also explains why the uncertainty be so large if light be not come perpendicular to the grate the pattern will not be described perfectly by 1 from the wavelength obtain in table 2 it be possible to calculate the rydberg constant since it be already explain that the green colour wavelength do not match any of the value from literature it will not be use to obtain rydberg 's constant the other three wavelength will be use and we can expect to obtain very accurate value since the wavelength be also found to be accurate the final energy level in each case be 2 since all the emission line be part of the balmer series furthermore the initial energy level for each wavelength will be guess base on the fact that the energy of a photon be inverse proportional to the wavelength for example red light have the large wavelength hence it be produce by the low energy transition where the initial energy state be 3. blue light have slightly more energy hence the initial state be 4 and in the case of purple light the initial energy state be 5. equation 2 can be rearrange to obtain the rydberg constant i decide to write down the value for the constant to 9 significant figure since they will be use together to get the final result by take the average of the three value for each colour we obtain the follow result 𝑅 ∞ 10986233.4 ± 17863.9 𝑚 −1 ≅ 1.099 × 10 7 ± 2 × 10 4 𝑚 −1 6 the value of the constant found in literature be 𝑅 ∞ 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 2 the obtain value for the rydberg constant have the value from literature include in it uncertainty range we can conclude that the experimental procedure be appropriate and the error estimation be reasonable the aim of this experiment be to obtain the value of rydberg 's constant the experimental procedure be quite good because we have obtain an accurate value for the constant but there be still some possibility for improvement we should have definitely checked that we have observe the right colour since it turn out that one of the observe one be not come from hydrogen this be not a huge problem since the constant could still be derive from other colour furthermore we could have also minimize other error we could have repeat the calibration until the central interference line would be at exactly 0 degree because probably then we would have also see small difference between the measurement on opposite side the error on the distance between two slit be also probably an overestimation one way to low it would be two use light with know wavelength find it interference patter and calculate the distance between two slit with the associate uncertainty the great strength of the data analysis for this experiment in my opinion be use the sine of angle versus order number graph because it really help to low the uncertainty in the slope and consequently in the rydberg constant appendix a estimate the uncertainty of slope although the determination of uncertainty of slope be of central importance i decide to put in into in the appendix because it take a large amount of space logger pro be use to determine the uncertainty in slope at first all the data point with uncertainty be plot by use the `` model `` function under the `` analyze `` tab i be able to create an arbitrary best fit line and change it slope to see what be the great and low slope that could be plot through the error bar\"\n"," \"the aim of this experiment be to provide a calculation for rydberg 's constant by use the emission line of hydrogen by observe red and aqua emission line the expect transition level for each and use the spectrometer equation we be able to obtain two very close value for rydberg 's constant and establish a final value and uncertainty for the red emission line we obtain a value of 𝟏𝟎 𝟕𝟕𝟐𝟏𝟑𝟒 ± 𝟎 𝟎𝟐𝟗𝟗𝟒𝟎 × 𝟏𝟎 𝟔 𝒎 −𝟏 and for the aqua emission line we obtain 𝟏𝟎 𝟕𝟗𝟒𝟐𝟖𝟎 ± 𝟎 𝟎𝟐𝟑𝟕𝟏𝟗 × 𝟏𝟎 𝟔 𝒎 −𝟏 .the percentage error be 0.28 and 0.22 respectively though neither value be within 𝝈 of the generally-accepted value for 𝑹 ∞ i. ascertain the elemental makeup of object be an important task in both research and industrial application thus if we be able to determine this composition by the emission or absorption spectrum of object we would have a non-invasive technique to determine their makeup rydberg 's constant enables u to make prediction a to the constituent element of object base just on their emission spectrum and it value be therefore an important experimental quantity to be determine calculate rydberg 's constant enables u to reliably determine the expect emission spectrum of different material and hence employ physical method in order to nondestructively determine the chemical composition of different compound we can also employ such technique to successfully determine the composition of otherwiseinaccessible object such a star 2 in order to determine rydberg 's constant 𝑅 ∞ we use a grate spectrometer first we experimentally determine the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission line use the grate equation we then experimentally determine the value of 𝑅 ∞ an atom be compose of a nucleus and an electronic shell depend on the element the atom can have multiple layer on it electronic shell each with a quantize energy level this mean that electron can not occupy energy state in between those level however when an atom be excite i.e when energy be impart upon it it electron can gain enough energy to transition to a level farther away from the nucleus afterward they will transition back to their original energy level and in the process release a photon of energy level equivalent to the energy difference energy gap between the electron 's transition level these emit photon constitute the atom 's emission spectrum we use rydberg 's constant to predict what sort of photon i.e predict their wavelength and energy a certain element 's spectrum will consist of 2 the grate spectrometer u a grate with 𝑁 slit to disperse incident light the light which pas through the grate will be deflect at an angle 𝜃 and will suffer from constructive and destructive interference due to their change in phase which will in turn create a certain interference pattern accord to theory this interference pattern will roughly resemble a succession of peak and valley the phase difference between neighbour ray be give by 1 the valley of the pattern correspond to the minimum of interference which occur for 𝑁 slit when the peak of this interference pattern correspond to the maximum of interference which occur when the phase difference be an integer multiple of 2n 1 c/ 2nm 2nm 2 dsin 0 5 accord to theoretical expectation we would expect any transition photon to obey the relation 6 where n and p be the number of the initial and final energy state of the atom equation 6 allows u to obtain an experimental value for rex give that we know the other quantity for our experiment p 2 in all case while n 3 for red light and n 4 for aqua light 4 in order to obtain j we can use the grate equation 1 where j be the w avelength of the spectral line d be the distance between two slit in our diffraction grate e be the angle at which an interference maximum occurs and m be the correspond order number the order number be an integer quantity and for the i th line of a specific colour observe after rotate the grate clockwise or anti-clockwise from the define start position i m thus m can take both negative and positive value accord to equation 7 if we plot sin 0 a a function of m we should obtain a linear plot from whose gradient we can extract j and calculate it associate error namely the gradient from we then use the covariance matrix our number of sample be large enough to use this method to find the uncertainty of this parameter r which we will call ay thus we obtain -from which we find 11 from equation 6 we find from this w e find the uncertainty in our value for r 00 our final result will be in the form before perform the experiment we have to calibrate the spectrometer so a to achieve a good resolution define a the resolve power at which both my lab partner and i be able to easily observe two give set of spectral emission line the process be perform use a sodium lamp since it do not run the risk of burning out and consist of the diffraction grate we use have 77.8 slit per millimetre and we found it to be best in achieve a good resolution in the spectrometer the actual experiment be do use a hydrogen lamp which allow u to observe hydrogen 's spectral emission line for increase accuracy the device use to measure the angle include a vernier scale so we be able to measure our result with ½ arcminute precision after establish the 0 𝑡ℎ order number we rotate the optical device clockwise and anticlockwise record the angle of diffraction and the order number we then process the data computationally create a line of best fit between the order number and the sine of the diffraction angle our experimental result confirm the expectation of the linear relationship between the order number and the sine of the angle at which interference maximum occur a be evident from the figure below however when plot the residual obtain when we subtract the expect value from the real value a nonlinear trend be observe which point to systematic error occur in our experimental setup therefore for the red and aqua maximum we obtain the percentage error on these value be 0.28 and 0.22 for red and aqua respectively which implies high statistical accuracy derive from the large sample base and low overall random error the random error which do exist be likely due to not reading the middle of the emission line accurately statistical error could be even far reduce by systematically building an even large database of measurement nevertheless our experimental range do not coincide or include the expect theoretical value for rydberg 's constant 3 𝑅 ∞ 10,973,731.6 𝑚 −1 10.9737316 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 this be likely due to systematic error affect the experiment some source of systematic error likely include misalignment of the optical piece tiny difference in air pressure and temperature cause slight change in the behaviour of the space through which light pas thereby introduce small error in our reading improve the experiment would require more stringent condition for perform it firstly the room in which the experiment be perform be not dark and might have cause u to miss some of the maximum associate with high order number a these be less visible when parasitic light upset the experimental setup moreover repeat the experiment several time would help improve confidence in the result an improve setup and procedure would be instead of use a manual rotate mechanism use a mechanical rotator and measure the angle of the emission maximum use a digital instrument write a program which can recognize the colour and order number of the emission maximum and thus build a digital database with reliable and highly precise measurement look to quantify systematic error from optical piece misalignment and the aforementioned difference in air pressure and temperature by mean of a different experiment so a to get a proper margin of error use a grate spectrometer we be able to precisely measure rydberg 's constant while thanks to the number of sample and thorough experimental procedure the statistical random error on our result be very small a outline in the previous section comparison with the generally accepted value for rydberg 's constant reveals that we have not measure it to an adequate level of accuracy this be due to the error discus above nonetheless have the value for rydberg 's constant enables u to perform theoretical research a well a to apply our knowledge to practical application in research spectroscopy can be use to determine the composition of star and other light-emitting object in industrial application spectroscopy can be use to non-destructively determine the exact chemical composition of material use in industrial application these application thus enable u to check assumption make in scientific research and theory a well a to aid in practical industrial development appendix i include the table of value use for determine the fit present heretofore and for the uncertainty obtain this be to acknowledge the help in perform the experiment offer by my lab partner\"\n"," \"the excitation and subsequent deexcitation of an electron in an atom result in the emission of one or several photon the rydberg formula relates the difference in the energy state of the electron to the wavelength of the emit photon 1 and contains the rydberg constant hence by determine the wavelength emit and the respective energy transition cause them complete here for hydrogen an accurate value for the rydberg constant can be found the final value determine be 1.07x10 7 ± 6.69x10 4 m -1 which have a difference of 2.42 to the current accepted value a standard grate spectrometer be use to measure the angle of diffraction of the emission line from a hydrogen lamp which allow the wavelength of each line to be calculate the inverse of the wavelength be plot against a function of it correspond excite principal quantum number and the gradient be use to calculate the rydberg constant he balmer series be discover in 1885 and be described by a purely empirical formula relate the inverse wavelength of the emission line see from a hydrogen discharge lamp to a series of integer this formula be then generalize by johannes robert rydberg in 1889 but it be only after development in the atomic model by niels bohr in 1913 that the formula could be explain by theory 1 the derivation for this formula be write in the appendix of this report the balmer series only applies to photon emit in the visible spectrum due to electron deexciting to principal quantum number n 2. however the generalisation can be use to describe other series such a the lyman series of ultraviolet line due to deexcitation to n 1 and can also easily be modify to suit any nucleus 2 where λ be the emit wavelength z be the atomic number of the atom be excite in the case for hydrogen z 1 r∞ be the rydberg constant and n1 and n2 be the principal quantum number of the initial and excite state of the electron respectively n2 n1 the rydberg constant be currently one of the most accurately-measured physical constant with a recommend relative uncertainty of 6.6x10 -12 3 it be an extremely important and relevant constant because it be inherently link to the fine structure constant among several other fundamental constant which can be test for consistency in various physical system hence verify the accuracy of the theory 4 the experimental method use here to determine it value be relatively simple a hydrogen discharge lamp be use to emit various wavelength of light correspond to different energy change due to electron deexciting from different energy level three different wavelength be emit and see through the telescope of a grate spectrometer a each wavelength have diffract by a different amount the grate equation where λ be the wavelength d be the distance between each slit in the grate θ be the angle to the central maximum that a maximum be see and m be the order of diffraction be then use to calculate the wavelength of each emit colour this be do by plot the sine of the angle to the central maximum that a maximum be observe against the order at which the angle be observe multiply the gradient of the resultant graph by d give the wavelength this be repeat for each colour until the three wavelength be found in order to carry out a second plot to determine the value of r∞ the value of n2 for each correspond wavelength have to be found because electron be deexciting to energy level 2 it be deduce that value of n2 have to be 3 4 and 5. the large the difference between n1 and n2 the more energy be emit a light and hence the low the wavelength a plot be make of the inverse wavelength against − and the gradient -which be equal to the value of r∞ -was found the grate spectrometer use be a standard student spectrometer comprise of a collimator telescope and rotatable mount focus knob be use to focus the eyepiece and collimator the eyepiece be focus so that an object a simple mark on an illuminate blank sheet of paper held up against a wall around 30cm away be see clearly and the telescope be focus on an illuminate marker approximately 9m away this be a good enough approximation for the object to be at an `` infinite `` distance so that no parallax be observe blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk t a sodium lamp a then place by the slit to focus the collimator and find the optimal slit width the reason for use this lamp be because a hydrogen lamp which be use for the rest of the experiment would be prone to overheat if left active for large period of time the lamp would have to be continuously run so the time take to focus the collimator be far great than that of take individual measurement a similar procedure be carry out regard the focus the instrument this time focus on an image of the emission spectrum of sodium the lamp initially glowed purple rather than the characteristic orange of sodium due to a small amount of radon present in the lamp before the sodium be completely vapourised the slit width be then low so that the line width observe be low this be do because the width of the line could be use a a measure of uncertainty the angle of the line to the central maximum would be measure at the centre of the line so if the line be wider the measurement be more likely to deviate from the centre of the line ensure that the telescope be precisely 180° to the collimator by line up the centre of the line with the centre of the eyepiece crosswire the vernier scale on the grate table be use to rotate the telescope through 90°00 ± 03 the small realistic value that could be read off the scalewhich read to the near arc-minute and clamped in position the collimator and telescope be then perpendicular to each other the reading on the vernier scale at this point be 15°54 a 300 line/mm grate be place in the rotatable mount at the centre of the grate table this grate a chosen over the 80 line/mm option because in order to calculate the wavelength the grate equation be use assume the error in angle be constant e.g due to resolution of the vernier scale maximise the angle will lead to the minimisation of percentage uncertainty associate with the angle this can be do by increase d in the grate equation in order for the grate to be exactly perpendicular to the collimate incident light the grate be rotate until the reflection of the emission line be see in the telescope this ensure that the grate be 45° to both the collimator and telescope so by add 45°00 to the angle above the grate be position precisely perpendicular to the incident light the telescope be then rotate back to the central maximum of the diffraction pattern the process be repeat for the hydrogen lamp this be do relatively quickly and the lamp do not overheat with the central maximum be at 211°45 and a width of 0°55 212°13 -211°18 table 1.1 to 1.3 below be present a such because each of the three colour violet cyan red be analyse separately to give a distinct wavelength only the mean measure angle be give and the central maximum be observe at angle 211°45 with a width of 0° 55 the width be use a an estimate of uncertainty in θ base on the idea that measurement to the centre of any line can only be make accurate to ± one quarter of the width of the line this be because it be estimate that the angle actually measure would only fall into half the width either side of the true centre of the line the sine of the width of the central maximum be use a the uncertainty in θ when plot sin θ against order however this value be not use in any calculation because it be only a very rough not even take into account the width of the other maximum suggestion a to how uncertainty could be measure fig 1.1 5 a basic pasco model student spectrometer that could be use to determine the wavelength of spectral emission from a hydrogen lamp fig 1.2. show a sodium lamp and spectrometer where the diffraction grate be 45° to both the collimator and telescope this be to ensure it will be precisely perpendicular to the incident light after be rotate precisely 45° clockwise in this case a can be see the angle measure at an order be roughly equal to the angle of the opposite order this agrees with what should be see a the interference pattern be symmetrical about the central maximum furthermore when determine the fit of the line a small value for intercept found for each fit for cyan and red this be of the order -10 -4 and for violet be 10 -3 although this be negligible compare to other source of uncertainty such a the width of the line it do suggest that a slight systematic error may be present one source could be due to the diffraction grate not be precisely perpendicular to the incident light hence result in the modify grate equation where θi be the angle of incidence to the grate this lead to an intercept of -sin θi because the intercept be small and a mixture of both positive and negative value this implies that the grate may have be rotate first in one direction for cyan and red and then in the opposite direction for violet possibly due to a component not be clamped firmly in place the value of the intercept be negligible but worth note here the scipy library also allows for the fit of a line to be calculate the output of which be displayed in the table below scipy be also able to output the covariance matrix which can be use to determine the uncertainty in the gradient and intercept let m represent the gradient of the line for the plot above firstly this allows the wavelength to be found by simply multiply the gradient by the constant d 10 -3 300 m and secondly since the uncertainty in m be give by the root of the first value in the covariance matrix the uncertainty in λ can be calculate by multiply the uncertainty in m by the partial derivative of the right-hand side of equation 3 with respect to m which be simply bohr use the idea that electron could only occupy allow energy level in an atom and can only move between them if give or release the same energy a a photon a the difference between the two level initial i and final f because bohr 's model propose that electron can only emit energy when transition between energy level an electron could move in a stable orbit around the nucleus without emit energy hence the magnitude of the electron 's angular momentum would have to be quantize such that where me be the rest mass of the electron h be planck 's constant n be an integer represent the principal quantum number and rn and vn be the radius and speed of the electron at orbit n. bohr 's simplify model of the electron orbit in a circular orbit around a far large proton meant he could equate the coulomb force to the centripetal force act on the electron at orbit n where e be the magnitude of the charge of the electron and c d be the permittivity of free space solve equation 2 and 3 simultaneously give the follow expression for the radius and speed of an electron at principal quantum number n and 5 the total energy of the electron be the sum of it kinetic and potential energy and by again assume that the electron maintains a stable orbit around a proton be give by it be easily see that this reduces to a change in n from ni to nf will correspond to a change in energy of ei to ef use 1 and 7\"\n"," \"this report present a method which make use of the grate spectrometer for study the spectmm of light of a hydrogen lamp and use this spectmm to

adjustment the telescope be align with the axis of the collimator a sodium lamp be use for the last part of the spectrometer calibration instead of the hydrogen lamp itself because unlike the hydrogen

the scale of angle on the rotate base the telescope be rotate precisely 90 degree and be fix in that position this scale consists of a main scale 0° -360° which be in degree and a vemier scale o -30 which be in minute just like with a standard vemier calliper the vemier zero be the reference division when reading on the main scale then the vernier scale division which coincides with one of the main scale division be use to calculate the final angle 1 minute on the vemier scale equal to 60° on the main scale 12 let u say for instance we deliberately coincide the vemier zero scale with the 160° main scale division to tum the telescope by 90° the 50° division on the main scale should coincide with the vemier zero division which should remain in a fix position that be only the main scale should be rotate retuming to the spectrometer calibration a suitable grate be place on the table between the collimator and the telescope the grate use in this experiment have approximately 78.8 line per mm 6 the table be rotate until a reflect image of the entrance slit can be see in the eyepiece this usually occurs when the plane of the grate be at 45° a from the collimator axis the telescope be

intersection of the line give an indication how accurately the grate spectrometer w a calibrate the closer the intersection be to the zero-order m the well the calibration of the grate spectrometer be ultimately the gradient of the final graph figure 9 which be a plot of 1/ a against l/n 2 -l/p 2 give u the negative of the rydberg constant for the red colour n 3 for the blue colour n 5 and for the violet one n 6 10 thus the positive value of the latter obtain computationally be then the main aim of the experiment be to detennine the rydberg constant roo use a hydrogen lamp and the grate spectroscopy method a sodium lamp be use durin the calibration of the grate spectrometer during the experiment there be a lot of problem and systematic eitors w e encounter and this can be show that our result obtain for the rydberg constant 3.45 ± 1.03 x 10 6 m-1 be very far from the officially accepted value 1 0 973 731.6 m-1 5 the first problem be that after sometimes it become ve1y difficult to position accurately the cross-hair on the violet ~olow spectrum of the hydrogen light due to the ve1y low light m tens1ty we could not even see the cross-hair through the eyepiece secondly we knew during the experiment that a the hydrogen lamp get more and more hot the colour component of the latter fade away and so we decide to tum the lamp off for the lamp to cool down however when we try to tum it on again the lamp never light on • again and so we have to change our hydrogen lamp therefore i think that take measurement of the violet colour from another hydrogen lamp induced significant uncertainty in our result the third problem be that it be quite difficult to read the scale on the spectrometer rotate base even use a loop equip with a light bulb while try to read the scale of angle it cause some eye-strained to address the first and second problem a deuterium lamp can be use to detemune the rydberg constant instead of a hydrogen lamp because the deuterium lamp give great intensity and have a longer life even though it cost more 15 the third problem can be solve by use a grate spectrometer which have a digital scale of angle so that the measurement of the position of the order be more accurate and easy to read even though we do not get the result we hop for this experiment taught u how to calibrate a grate spectrometer how to use it to determine the rydberg constant and how difficult it be to determine the latter to high accuracy\"\n"," \"10 900 000 ± 232 000 m-1 chemical element emit discrete frequency of electromagnetic radiation when atom go from a

beam of light disperses into a spectrum accord to huygens each point the grate spectrometer -rydberg constant despite the same person reading the scale in addition to the ± 3ʹ error from reading the value there would be a far ± 3ʹ error due to any fault in set up the spectrometer for the red and blue line the slit width be extremely narrow result in a negligible error due to a wide slit for the violet spectral line we measure the difference in angle between one end of the band to the other to be 1ʹ when graph these error be very inconspicuous after obtain value for 𝜃 for different order number n plot graph for 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against n give straight line for each wavelength due to the proportional relationship between them with a gradient use the covariance matrix in python the graphical uncertainty show in table ii can be calculate along with value for the rydberg constant in table i the error from measure and incorrect calibration be much high than these value meaning they be more significant than the statistical error from table i the average rydberg constant can be calculate a 10 863 637 m -1 the uncertainty from table ii table iii and the standard error from the mean calculation add in quadrature give the uncertainty correspond with the average rydberg constant which be 231 705 m -1 therefore the result of the experiment be 10 900 000 ± 232 000 𝑚 −1 there be a possibility if the set up of the spectrometer have go significantly wrong that there be a substantial systematic error in the value calculate a way to recognise the systematic error would be to repeat the experiment with different equipment and set up the spectrometer again another way to analyse the result obtain be to realise that the beam at order number n 1 and n -1 be symmetrical about the zero-order beam path therefore the value 𝜃 for both these order be the same this give u two value for each order from which an average angular deviation can be found however these can not be use to calculate the standard error for each order wavelength additionally this method of analysis do not require graphical representation of the result at all an example of this method be use with the red spectral line be show in table iv from here an average wavelength for the specific colour can be compute and then this can be substitute into the rydberg formula in this method of analysis there be statistical uncertainty due to work out the mean instead of the graphical uncertainty from the initial method the standard error of the wavelength be manipulate to become the error in the rydberg constant calculate use each of the three wavelength far manipulation of the uncertainty and the value for the rydberg constant the result determine by this analysis method be 10 900 000 ± 244 000 𝑚 −1 this value be relatively similar to the one calculate from the previous analysis the difference be that the uncertainty in this method be slightly great this could be due to the addition of the standard error in calculation the standard error in inversely proportional to the square root of the number of data sample a way to improve the uncertainty in this method be to increase the number of data sample in this experiment the value obtain for the rydberg constant be in the same magnitude a the measure value also it be consistent to 2 significance level however there be many improvement which can be make so that the error associate with this value be decrease firstly obtain more data would mean the value for the deviation angle be more reliable also it would allow an average to be calculate this reduces the chance of anomaly in calculation which could be due to misjudgement of the vernier scale even though an average can be calculate by use the second analysis in the result section the number of total data point remain the same so the anomaly can not be recognise and omit a well a possible also calculate the standard error with a sample of 2 will give a large error contribution secondly increase the width of the slit for the violet spectral line cause a high contribution of uncertainty to the final value a way to improve would be to remove any other source of light present in the space around u this would increase the contrast between the black background and violet spectral line the rydberg constant be useful because it be part of an elegant formula that allows the transition wavelength to be calculate easily\"\n"," \"we observe the ray of emission of hydrogen atom use a grate spectrometer the measurement of the angle of diffraction of a range of

major mystery of physic today be the duality between classical and quantum mechanic indeed at small scale nature behaves in a quantify way whereas at large scale it behaves in a continuous way the experiment we realise be very important a it be one of the few where we can observe at our macroscopic scale phenomenon have a quantum origin indeed we observe that atom light emission be quantify to specific wavelength this observation lead u to discus the dual nature of light this experiment u the effect of light diffraction see ii.a to look at what happens inside the atom the rydberg constant be one of the fundamental physical constant and be today know to 14 decimal place 1 use a grate spectrometer see fig 2 to look at the emission ray of hydrogen atom come from a hydrogen lamp see fig 2 we aim to calculate the rydberg constant this very precise instrument use in a dark room allow u to limit noisy light to a minimum level a. about the grate spectrometer consider light a wave we know that white light be a superposition of all the visible colour 3 indeed it be compose of wave of wavelength from 400 nm to 700nm we can decompose any light into it different wavelength use either a prism or a grate in our case we use a grate which be a transparent piece of glass which contain a very large number of equally space narrow line when light shine through a grate it be diffract by the line and light change it path by an angle θ give by 2𝜋 𝜆 d sin 𝜃 2𝜋m 2 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the light d be the space between two line of the grate and m be the number of the ray from the central ray when light go through an obstacle of a width of the same magnitude a it wavelength it get diffract 4 because of this phenomenon of diffraction the ray be displace from the straight path and appear a thin ray repeat themselves a we turn the telescope the light 's maximum intensity which be the ray we see be locate at 2𝜋m m be the number of the ray 2 rearrange 1 we have 2 we can therefore see that a beam of light contain different wavelength get separate into ray of a specific wavelength shift from the straight path by an angle θ depend on their wavelength accord to bohr 's model 5 atom be compose of a central nucleus compose of both proton and neutron and of a set of layer contain a define number of electron depend on the energy they carry the electron can pa from one `` layer `` call level of energy to another this change of level of energy be call a `` quantum leap `` if the electron jump from a low level of energy to a high one it absorbs energy in the form of a photon particle of light of a particular wavelength reversely an energise electron will quickly 5 return to a low level of energy by emit it excess of energy in the form of a photon of the wavelength correspond to the one of the photon it initially absorbed in the quantum theory everything be quantify that be why we be in presence of specific wavelength and energy level the hydrogen lamp function accord to this quantum theory indeed the lamp contains hydrogen atom see fig 2 that be excite by the heating of the lamp and emit light of specific wavelength when the atom be deexciting come back to low energy level 5 the hydrogen atom emits ray both visible ultraviolet and infrared the visible ray be give by the balmer series 2 and correspond to transition from the high energy level 6 th to 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level the visible ray be show in fig 1. visible wavelength emit by a hydrogen atom from left to right the ray correspond to transition from the 6 th to the 2 nd energy level from the 5 th to the 2 nd from the 4 th to the 2 nd and from the 3 rd to the 2 nd 2 c. about the rydberg constant measure the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw the rydberg constant r ∞ relates the transition between level of energy to the wavelength of the emit or absorbed photon for a transition between level n to level p n p we have where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the emit photon accord to the theory we should be able to distinguish 3 different ray of light with different wavelength each correspond to a specific transition in the hydrogen atom we be also suppose to see these ray repeat themselves a few time a we rotate the spectrometer r ∞ be also give by where 𝑚 e be the rest mass of the electron 𝜀 0 be the permittivity of free space 𝑒 be the electron 's charge 𝑐 be the speed of light in vacuum and ℎ be plank 's constant the accepted value for this fundamental constant be 1.097 373 156 8508 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 1 note in the case of the hydrogen atom the value of the rydberg constant be slightly different a it have to take into account the effect of the central proton 6 in the case of the hydrogen atom the rydberg constant r h be give by r h e h hc 6 5 where e h be the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom h be the planck 's constant and c the speed of light in vacuum however the difference be too small to be apprehend at our level of precision and we will therefore calculate r ∞ first of all we have to set up our spectrometer a show in fig 2. after understand what the principal piece be we start to look at the light emit by a sodium lamp we do not use the hydrogen lamp to set up the apparatus a it heat up quickly and tends to shut down after 15 to 20 minute of use to determine what be the straight path of light we place the 78.8 lines/mm grate at 45° of the incoming light we turn the rotate arm of the spectrometer until the light reflect by the grate be visible see ii.a we take note of the position of the arm know from the law of reflection that the reflection angle be the same a the incident angle we deduct that our straight path be at 45° to this measurement we deduce that our spectrometer be align when the rotate arm be at 349.42° when observe the spectrum of emission of the hydrogen lamp we observe 3 different colour red light blue and purple the purple be harder to see than the other colour rotate our telescope we saw that the ray repeat themselves multiple time a predict by the theory see ii.a regard the allocate time and the fact that we could not have the hydrogen lamp light for a very long time we chose to take 3 time the same set of measurement let the lamp cool down between measurement for each colour we chose to measure the angle of diffraction of the 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd ray go to the left correspond respectively to 𝑚 1 2 3 and of the correspond ray go to the right 𝑚 −1 −2 −3 a well a of the central ray 𝑚 0 we therefore aim to have 21 measurement per colour if we have have more time we would have measure the 4 th ray for each colour to the left and to the right three time for each colour rather than take a fourth time 7 measurement for each colour we be indeed interested in the overall trend of the ratio 𝑚/ sin 𝜃 and not in the particular angle 𝜃 at which be locate each ray because of noisy light in the room the purple ray be really faint and hence hard to see sometimes we be not sure if the ray we be observe be the second or the third purple ray another probable source of error be also that we do n't see the difference between two violet wavelength indeed we saw very faint purple line and we estimate that they be all of the same wavelength but accord to theory we should have have two violet ray we therefore chose to make measurement for the purple ray keep in mind that they have a high degree of uncertainty and that we could and probably should not use them when calculate the value of the rydberg constant we try to get the purple ray a bright a possible by measure them last when the hydrogen lamp be hotter and the ray brighter a more atom would deexcite in the same time however it be not good enough we manage to take only one measurement of the ray -2 and 2 and only 2 measurement of the ray -3 and 3. we estimate that we have an error of ±15 arc minute on measurement -2 and 2 we indeed ca n't determine statistically the error despite poor light condition the grate spectrometer be overall very precise for this kind of experiment indeed because of the slit situate on the light 's path and because of the process of interference the ray of light be situate in a small region of space this help in the precision so do the cross-wire see fig 2 two thin black line cross each other in the centre of the lens that help centre the measurement exactly in the centre of the ray another feature of the spectrometer that improves greatly precision be the vernier scale this apparatus be precise to 1 which corresponds to a precision of 0.02° put together the different measurement and use the statistical method to determine the error we obtain the result show in table i where 𝜃 blue be the angle of the blue ray subtract the value of each ray 's position to the value of the central ray we find the relative angle of displacement of each ray take the sine of the angle of the relative angle of displacement and plot it against the ray number we obtain the graph give in fig 3 a b and c use 2 on the measurement summarise in table i the value of d calculate in 5 and obtain error use the statistical method we calculate the value of the wavelength of each colour a be 𝜆 red 6.67 ± 0.19 × 10 −7 𝑚 𝜆 blue 4.95 ± 0.05 × 10 −7 𝑚 and 𝜆 purple 4.95 ± 0.31 × 10 −7 𝑚. a we can see our measurement for the purple wavelength seem wrong a they have a high uncertainty and be not coherent a we calculate the same wavelength for the blue and purple set of ray this comfort the hypothesis make in section iii b that the measurement of purple ray be unprecise and should not be use in far calculation a we have see in part section ii.b the blue ray correspond to a transition from level 4 to level 2. rearrange 3 we have take 𝜆 𝜆 blue n=2 and p=4 we can calculate an experimental value of 𝑅 ∞ 𝑅 ∞ blue 1.08 ± 0.01 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 similarly the red ray correspond to a transition from the 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level use 𝜆 red n=2 and p=3 and 6 we find 𝑅 ∞ red 1.08 ± 0.03 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 take the mean of these two value and the mean error we find our experimental value for the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ exp 1.08 ± 0.02 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 we estimate that the error come from different source firstly a part of our error come from a move of the grate that result in a misalignment of the spectrometer indeed we see that our central ray the one not be deflect be n't always at the same position use statistical mean to calculate error we find that this central ray be locate at 168.85 ± 0.05° we can therefore estimate our error a be 0.05° furthermore if the vernier scale allow u a great precision it be also sometimes a bit hard to read we consider that we have a random error of ±3 ′ on the measurement use the vernier scale of each angle because of the parallax effect and the bad visibility in the dark room we also estimate that we have an error of ±2.5 on the determination of the ray position indeed we measure that the width of our ray be 10 we consider that we know whether we be closer to one of the border or to the centre of the ray but we ca n't really determine if we be at ¼ of the ray or at ½ of it therefore our error here be the quarter of the ray width 10/4 2.5 we also have source of error in the fact that the spectrometer might have move horizontally and would not be exactly in front of the slit anymore this a well a the background light present in the room during the experiment reduce the relative brightness of the observe ray and cause u to cast out our measurement of the purple ray finally environmental condition such a the ambient humidity temperature and air pressure probably influence the behaviour of the hydrogen atom however they be difficult to estimate and we consider that they be negligible ideally we could determine their magnitude by do the experiment in different meteorological condition however it seem really difficult to do it practise because of the multiple vary factor humidity temperature noisy light ... that prevent u from repeat the experiment in the exact same condition add all the estimate error we find an error of 0.14° which corresponds to an error in the wavelength of 0.18 × 10 −7 𝑚 which be small than our error on the red wavelength but still of the same order of magnitude we therefore chose our measure value for the error a they be big than the estimate one the accepted value of the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 1 lie within our margin of error our estimate for the rydberg constant be 𝑅 ∞ exp 1.08 ± 0.02 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 and be coherent with the theory we observe that the hydrogen atom emits only at certain wavelength which be coherent with the quantum picture and the description of light a a particle in the experiment we also experienced diffraction of light through the grate a phenomenon more easily explain by a wave-like picture of light this experiment be one of the few that relates quantum mechanic to optic allow u to encounter the wave-particle duality because we use a very precise apparatus we have less than a 2 error in our value for the constant this error come at 35 from a displacement from alignment at 35 from a unprecise reading of the vernier scale and at 30 from a difficult determination of the ray position the condition of experience brightness temperature humidity air pressure… played a role a they prevent u from make use of the purple ray a well a be source of systematic error however they ca n't be estimate use this sole experiment we could determine their magnitude by repeat the experiment in different meteorological condition the strength of this experiment be it precision the comprehensive view of the atom it give and the link it make between quantum mechanic and optic thanks to the precise apparatus we use this experiment be successful however it can be strongly improve by make it in a proper dark room with a more powerful hydrogen lamp that would allow u to measure the two purple set of ray a well a the blue and red one more precisely calculate the constant use 4 wavelength would indeed be more precise we could also measure a 4 th and even a 5 th ray from the central ray to improve our precision even far\"\n"," \"a of recent time the rydberg be one of the most accurately measure fundamental physical constant this report review how the rydberg constant be calculate use a grate spectrometer this be

due to their simple structure this be why a hydrogen lamp be use in this experiment in the lamp be hot electrically excite hydrogen gas this cause it to emit a spectrum that 's concentrate only at a few specific wavelength the space between these bright line provide data which can be use to draw many conclusion include the conclusion of this experiment spectroscopy be a highly successful and powerful technique due to the fact that it be non-invasive the other piece of equipment use be the grate spectrometer this be an instrument use to study the spectrum of light emit by the hydrogen lamp it u a lens to produce a collimate beam of light a diffraction grate disperses this beam due to it series of very fine groove cut in it surface the disperse beam be then focus by the camera onto the eyepiece of the spectrometer the spectrometer be make up of three component a collimator a diffraction grate and a telescope this be show in the schematic diagram below the light from the hydrogen lamp enters through an adjustable slit which be use to focus the camera this will be explain in the method the slit be strategically position at the focal point of the collimator to ensure that all the light passing through the diffraction grate be one parallel collimate beam of light all beam have the same angle of incidence the diffraction grate be simplify to a large number of equally space very narrow slit this cause the beam to disperse and the pattern be picked up at the telescope the diffraction angle depends on the wavelength of the light this be illustrate by the follow equation where d be the slit separation sin 𝜃 be the sin of the angle between adjacent emission line m be an integer and 𝜆 be the specific wavelength of that colour of light this equation implies a straight line when sin 𝜃 be plot against m. this allows for the wavelength and their uncertainty to be determine from the gradient and error bar which be calculate use python the diagram below show the diffraction patter for 4 slit the balmer series be the series of visible line which a discharge lamp emits the formula to describe these line be found by johaan balmer and be give by where n and p be integer represent the initial and final state of the atom the value of p for hydrogen be always 2 for balmer transition therefore this equation can be use to plot to give a straight line the rydberg constant and it uncertainty be calculate from there this phenomenon of why hydrogen only emit four line also know a the balmer line of hydrogen be explain by niels bohr in his model for the atom the electron which orbit the proton can only exist in certain orbital state a quantum number the diagram below show a visual representation of these transition the experiment be carry out in a dark room in the laboratory to allow clearer image to see through the spectrometer and reduce human error the method that be carry out in order to obtain all the data need be a follow \\uf0b7 the first and most important part of the experiment be set up the spectrometer so that it be in focus \\uf0b7 the camera lens be focus on a distant object so that the cross wire be on top of it \\uf0b7 then the hydrogen lamp be place near the slit and the collimator focus be adjust until a sharp image be show \\uf0b7 in order to ensure that the collimator be align at 0 degree with the camera the telescope be move through 90 degree and clamped \\uf0b7 then the grate table be turn until a reflect image be see use a mirror in place of the diffraction grate \\uf0b7 at this point the collimator and camera be at 45 degree from each other the telescope be rotate back through 45 degree and this give normal incidence to give the zeroth order measurement \\uf0b7 for each colour the telescope be rotate in both direction to look for the 1 st 2 nd etc order emission line \\uf0b7 the angle of each line be record \\uf0b7 measurement for the error be also take the width of the line be measure for each line i.e the difference in the angle between the two side of the strip \\uf0b7 this be the great source of uncertainty in this experiment and therefore it be the data use to plot the errorbars on the graph in the result \\uf0b7 at first it be thought that the great source of error would be from partner record different angle however when this be compare with the other source of error it be found that the subjective reading be much less significant than the error due to not know where to position the cross hair on every line a note regard the procedure that be follow be that after take the measurement for the first colour the hydrogen lamp stop work so it be replace with another one it be attempt to place it in exactly the same position so that it would not cause the reading for different colour to be inconsistent below be graph of sin 𝜃 against m for each colour these be use to calculate the wavelength it can be see that they all follow straight line trend use python 's poly1fit function the

include in the calculation the reason it be so far off from the trendline be that the blue light measurement be take use one lamp whereas the other two be both do use the same lamp although use only 2 point reduces the validity of the experiment conclusion can still be make furthermore the wavelength obtain be of the same order of magnitude but they be low than their actual value this be due to a

grate thus separate the different color of hydrogen a telescope be then use to measure the diffraction angle correspond to several order and the wavelength of the associate color for the balmer series of hydrogen the balmer series governs the descent of electron from high energy level to the second energy level then the rydberg constant be calculate use the three wavelength of the hydrogen light red violet and blue finally the mean value of the three obtain rydberg constant be obtain and use a the value of the rydberg constant the calculate value of the rydberg constant along with it associate error be within the range of the actual value the difference between the two value can be mainly attribute to different random and instrumental error which be discus thoroughly in this report the main aim behind the conduct experiment be to determine `` rydberg `` constant use the spectrum of hydrogen rydberg constant be a fundamental atomic constant which appear in several relationship famously associate with the hydrogen atom and have unit of m -1 1 this be determine by study the diffraction pattern of hydrogen light use a spectrometer a spectrometer be an instrument use to study different phenomenon of light 2 see section iii historically isaac newton in 1666 be the first scientist who demonstrate that sunlight be constitute of several different color and coin the word `` spectrum `` after that several other scientist include melville and angstrom study the different spectral line of different type of light until rydberg in 1890 mathematically derive a formula which include this constant finally bohr show that it can be express in more fundamental term 3 see section ii in this experiment the rydberg constant be determine use the relation of associate with the balmer series the balmer series describes the transition of electron in the hydrogen atom from high energy state to state of n=2 where n be the quantum number the spectral line consider in this experiment be the line correspond to n=3 red wavelength n=4 blue wavelength and n=5 violet wavelength which be in the visible spectrum 4 it be important to note that the balmer series contains several spectral line which be in the ultraviolet region furthermore determine the different wavelength of the three spectral line be base on the phenomenon of diffraction whereby incident light from the source bend when it encounter a diffraction grate 5 the main phenomenon behind this experiment be diffraction of light diffraction of light a mention in the introduction section be the phenomenon where a beam of light be spread out when encounter an obstacle grate in this case by geometrically analyze the pattern obtain the follow relationship can be derive where d be the slit separation in meter θ be the angle between two beam of light in radian m be the order number and λ be the wavelength of the incident light in meter a mention in the introduction section the balmer series be use to obtain the rydberg constant it be express a follow where r ∞ be rydberg constant in m -1 and n and p be integer which represent energy level of initial and final state respectively the rydberg constant can be express in more fundamental constant a where ɑ be a constant me be the electron mass kg c be the speed of light in vacuum m/s and h be planck 's constant joule second furthermore the constant ɑ can be determine use the follow formula determination of the rydberg constant use the spectrum of hydrogen where ϵ 0 be the permittivity in free space farad per meter therefore use equation 1 the wavelength of the three spectral line red blue and violet be calculate by plot three fit of sin θ v the order m where the slope of these plot represent λ/d hence from equation 2 and note that the value of p in the balmer series be 2 rydberg constant be determine the first step in the experiment be to adequately align the spectrometer first the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire by view the image of a distant object the window of the building face the lab a sodium lamp be then use for the purpose of position the telescope so that it be align with the axis of the collimator after that the telescope be move 90 degree the vernier scale be use to measure the angle and a grate be place in the holder the table be turn until a reflect image be see which indicates that it be at an angle of 45 degree finally the grate be place so that the beam be at normal incidence and then the telescope be position back to face the grate the sodium lamp be replace by the hydrogen lamp to start obtain data in order to determine rydberg constant the diffraction pattern of the hydrogen light be observe the telescope be use to observe the different spectral line at different order negative and positive order the start position be the zeroth order which have all three spectral line red blue and violet overlap then for the red and blue spectral line the angle of the order from m=-4 to m=4 be measure by reading the vernier scale however for the violet spectral line we be only able to observe the order from m=-2 to m=2 it be also important to note that the error in the vernier scale be take to be ±0.5 arcminute after obtain the data a plot be create use python for three fit for the three different spectral line of sin θ v the order m from which the wavelength of the light be obtain from these three different wavelength three different value of the rydberg constant be obtain and the mean and error of the value be calculate use python a well 6 the experimental data obtain in this experiment be diffraction angle for the three different spectral line of hydrogen at different negative and positive order hence a graph of sin θ v the order m be obtain graph 1 the plot of the three spectral line of hydrogen red blue and violet of equation y 0.05164x -0.002256 y 0.03728x 0.007478 and y 0.03377x -0.00164 respectively the three plot show a linear straight line a expect from the relation represent in equation 1 from the slope of the three fit the wavelength of the spectral line be calculate a follow similarly λviolet 473 nm and λviolet 428 nm hence use the three value of the wavelength three value of the rydberg constant be obtain from equation 2 it be important to note that the value for n for the red blue and violet wavelength be 3 4 and 5 respectively 7 the value of the rydberg constant be rred 10986831.91m -1 rblue 11273247.5m -1 and rviolet 11111581.14m -1 thus the mean value of the rydberg constant be calculate to be r 11123886.85m -1 associate uncertainty calculate in the follow section use python the error in the slope of the three fit be estimate and hence the error in the wavelength be calculate then δλred 8.1 nm similarly δλblue 54.8 nm and δλviolet 4.29 nm where the symbol δ mean the error of correspondingly the error in the three rydberg constant be δrred 135867 1306076 and δrviolet 111375. thus the error in the mean rydberg constant be δr 111375 this be calculate use the formula of the standard deviation and the number n of the dataset therefore the value of the rydberg constant obtain be r 11123886.85 ± 1317838. the calculate value of the rydberg constant along with it error lie within the range of the accepted value which be r 10973731.6 m -1 this indicates that the value be relatively accurate but do not rule out the possibility of the existence of systematic error equation 1 indicates that y-intercept of such fit should be zero which do not agree with the result although the y-intercept be small this be also the result of the existence of several source of error there be several source of error in the conduct experiment which explain the difference between the calculate value and the actual one first of all error in measure the diffraction angle due to the instrumental error of the vernier scale which be estimate to be 1 arc minute furthermore parallax error be take into consideration due to the difficulty in reading such small value at different angle to reduce parallax error my lab partner and i try to separately do the reading from the same angle for all measurement several outer source of error be present include light from neighbor experiment this be mainly evident when observe the violet spectral line be upon turn off the light from neighbor experiment two more order become clearly observe concern systematic error some possible source of error include the calibration of the spectrometer in other word the position of the telescope or grate might not have be exactly a require which therefore would have affected all the obtain measurement additionally the eyepiece of the spectrometer be open in order to see large beam of light this in turn make it more difficult to see where exactly the spectral line be align with the cross wire moreover influence from external source light from outside might also have result in affect all the measurement finally possibly the major factor which explains the difference between the two value would be the number of data point obtain especially in the violet spectral line we be only able to obtain angle for 4 order from m=-2 to m=2 which would decrease the accuracy of the result it should be note that all the above uncertainty be take into consideration and express a error bar in graph 1 above the main aim of the conduct experiment be to calculate the value of rydberg constant the major result be therefore the r 11123886.85 ± 1317838 m -1 the calculate value of the along with it error lie within the range of the actual value of the rydberg constant the key success in the experiment be mainly be able to measure the diffraction angle the wavelength of the spectral line and thus the rydberg constant the main shortcoming be the rather large random error associate with the value of the rydberg constant this can be attribute to instrumental and random error related o the measurement take and possibly also to systematic error mainly due the calibration of the spectrometer there be several way to improve the result the main method to follow would be to obtain more data point this could be do by eliminate almost all possible source of light which would enable u to observe high order of diffraction both on the negative and positive side furthermore use a more advanced spectrometer which would show a clearer diffraction pattern would also result in show more order a more advanced spectrometer would also ensure that the spectral line would almost be exactly align on the cross wire which would increase the accuracy of the measure angle this experiment prove that by use the spectrometer to observe the diffraction of hydrogen light we be able to calculate to a relatively high degree of accuracy a fundamental constant in atomic physic\"\n"," \"a grate spectrometer be use to measure the wavelength of the most prominent spectral line produce by a hydrogen lamp

the same issue occur again however this time the effect be much less pronounce although the grate do not seem to be at exactly 90 • to the centre line of the collimator the hypothesis be the data from the first run be less accurate more spread out because the spectrometer be more misalign whereas the data from the second run be more accurate less spread out because the spectrometer be less misalign

vapour lamp although this do seem to be an unlikely scenario for this experiment a visual grate spectrometer be use to make the measurement other spectrometer design exist such a a computer-aided grate spectrometer in which the eyepiece be replace with a detector array usually a ccd or cmos sensor the benefit of use a computer-aided spectrometer over a visual grate spectrometer have already be investigate 6 in this investigation it be found that there be no significant improvement or reduction in the uncertainty of the measurement when use a computer-aided spectrometer thus this experiment would not be improve through this suggestion however if the experiment be to be repeat again much more care should be take in align the spectrometer when carry out this experiment the spectrometer do not appear perfectly align before the first data set be record before the second data set be record the spectrometer be align much more carefully however the alignment be still not perfect it be hypothesise that the misalignment of the spectrometer explains the difference in accuracy between the two separate run of the experiment in order to far reduce the error in measure the angle of the maximum in the spectrum a diffraction grate with a high number of lines/mm could have be use such that the angle separate the order of the spectrum would be large thus the uncertainty in determine the small change in the angle on the vernier scale would have be far reduce combine with the `` in/out `` method of measurement developed the uncertainty could be reduce to an even well range more repetition of the experiment could improve the final mean value take for r ∞ a long a the spectrometer be correctly align when carry out the experiment it be important to make detailed note on the

calculate our measure value for the rydberg constant be 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value give a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 1 due to the small percentage error but an uncertainty which do n't include the accepted value with slight improvement this method can produce accurate and precise measurement for the rydberg constant however in it current state the procedure give result which do n't agree with the accepted value the main reason for this inaccuracy be that it be difficult to read the scale on the grate spectrometer a it be too small this be not help by the fact that we have to constantly squint our eye to try to read the value from the scale with only a very bright desk lamp over the scale if a digital grate spectrometer be use then the measurement would be much more accurate he bohr model of the atom describes negatively charge electron in orbit of a positively charge central nucleus at particular radius at these radius

amount of energy they can jump to a high energy level if this occurs the electron be say to be excite energy can be transfer to the electron be several way include absorb a photon of electromagnetic radiation which have energy exactly equal to the difference between the two energy level if enough energy be give to the electron it will escape the electrostatic force of attraction of the positively charge nucleus and the atom will be ionise the rydberg constant be the wavenumber inverse wavelength of the photon of the low energy which will cause the ionisation of a hydrogen atom it be first use by swedish physicist johannes rydberg in 1890. it be one of the most accurately measure fundamental physical constant with accepted measure value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 ± 5.9x10 -10 1 however it can be express a a combination of other physical constant where me be the mass of an electron e be the charge of an electron h be plank constant c be the speed of light and ε0 be the permittivity of free space due to the number of fundamental physical constant which define the rydberg constant it be very important and powerful constant in particular it can be use to find the energy level within any atom of a know element this experiment will find a value for the rydberg constant by find the wavelength of spectral line use the principle of diffraction in the hydrogen vapour lamp be use a large potential difference be put across the hydrogen vapour this cause electron from the cathode at one end of the vapour tube to travel across it to the anode at the other end of the tube these electron collide with the electron in the hydrogen atom transfer energy to them this cause the electron in the hydrogen atom to gain more energy and thus move into a high energy level become excite the excite electron will eventually jump back to the ground state the low energy level this be call deexcitation the electron can jump to a low energy level by release a photon of electromagnetic radiation with energy equivalent to the difference between the energy level same energy of photon that would be require to excite the electron between the two energy level an excite electron can deexcite directly to the ground state or indirectly by descend to low energy level first this mean that lesser energy photon can be release by the de-excitation the energy of a photon e be dependent on it frequency f and be give by the relationship 𝐸 ℎ𝑓 2 where h be plank constant and have a value of 6.626070040 × 10 −34 j thus a electron de-excite many different wavelength of photon be produce which correspond to the different energy level transition measure the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer t for a hydrogen atom which have only one electron it have be observe that for all the

be observe in the energy level diagram below in figure 1. if these photon in be refract through a prism an emission spectrum will be produce a show in figure 2 below each line of the spectrum be call a spectral line each line corresponds to different frequency of photon which be release in de-excitation and be in the visible light frequency range emission spectrum can also be produce with

order and the angle of it diffraction be sin 𝜃 𝑁𝜆𝑚 3 where θ be the angle of diffraction of the order angle of order relative to central beam n be the number of slit per metre on the diffraction grate λ be the wavelength of the photon and m be the order of the beam if a graph of sin θ against order m be plot the wavelength of the spectral line can be found by divide the gradient of the by the number of slit per metre in the diffraction grate n the graph produce should be a straight line with a positive gradient the rydberg constant 𝑅 can be calculate use the wavelength of the spectral line and the rydberg formula show below where λ be the wavelength of the photon emit n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level of the electron a we be measure balmer series spectral line the final energy level be always the second energy level so the formula can be manipulate to in this experiment we be use the red and blue spectral line a they be most prominent thus by look at figure 1 and figure 2 on the left we can see the red spectral line be due to the transition from 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level this be because the red spectral line have the high frequency low energy of all the visible spectral line produce thus we can also see the blue spectral line be due to the electron transition from the 4 th to the 2 nd energy level this be because the blue spectral line have the second high frequency second low energy of all the visible spectral line produce thus we set up the grate spectrometer a show in the lab manual except a sodium lamp be use to calibrate it and the main scale be in 0.5º in do so we ensure that the crosshair be rotate to the `` x `` positon the telescope be in focus with the image of the spectral line and the diffraction grate be perpendicular to the incident source this be show in figure 4 of the experimental setup we then place the hydrogen lamp in front of the slit on the grate spectrometer i look through the eye piece lens on the grate spectrometer and found the zeroth spectral line this be identify a the brightest spectral line which be about 180º with the lamp and have all the different wavelength spectral line overlap we record the angle of the zeroth order spectral line by turn the eyepiece lens such that the cross hair be in the middle of the spectral line this measurement be use a a reference measurement ø0 i then measure the angle ø of the red spectral line from order -4 to 4. be the positive order be those anticlockwise of the zeroth order and the negative order be clockwise of the zeroth order a show in the figure 5. this be then repeat by my lab partner and an average angle for each order be calculate we then calculate the relative angle of the spectral line to the zeroth order θ by subtract the angle of the zeroth order spectral line from the average angle of each order we then plot a graph of sin θ against the order for the red spectral line and measure the gradient of the best line of fit we then divide the gradient by the grate space to obtain the wavelength of the spectral line this be then repeat for the blue spectral line the value for the wavelength of the red spectral line be inputted into equation 6 to find a value of the rydberg constant the value for the wavelength of the blue spectral line be inputted into equation 7 to find another value of the rydberg constant these value be average to produce an average value for the rydberg constant from this method this be compare to the accepted value the graph produce from the red spectral line be show below in figure 6. this graph show a positive correlation between sin θ and the order of the beam the graph have a gradient of 0.0532 ± 0.0013. when this be multiply by the grate space 78.8 line per mm it be found the wavelength of the red spectral line be 6.756x10 -7 ± 1.68x10 -8 m. when this be inputted into equation 6 below it be found that the rydberg constant be 10657641.3 ± 265669.6 m -1 the graph produce from the blue spectral line be show this graph show a positive correlation between sin θ and the order of the beam the graph have a gradient of 0.0385 ± 0.0002. when this be multiply by the grate space 78.8 line per mm it be found the wavelength of the blue spectral line be 4.890x10 -7 ± 3.0x10 -9 m. when this be inputted into equation 7 below it be found that the rydberg constant be 10906793.3 ± 67911.9 m -1 when these value where average our measure value for the rydberg constant be 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value give a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 a we can see from both these graph the uncertainty in sin θ be small a the uncertainty in the measurement of θ be 2 3 ° this meant the uncertainty in sin θ be give by the expression the small uncertainty in sin θ lead to a small uncertainty in the wavelength of the spectral line λ give by the expression thus the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for each wavelength be give by the expression where n be the initial energy level thus the uncertainty in the average value of the rydberg constant be even though the uncertainty seem large it be relativity small when compare to the magnitude of the rydberg constant moreover our measure value have a small percentage error of 1.745 however our uncertainty do include the accepted value thus our measure value disagrees with the accepted value the aim of this experiment be to determine the rydberg constant this be do by find the wavelength of the spectral line associate with the balmer series we found this by the principle of diffraction a different wavelength of photon will diffract through a diffraction grate by different angle from this we measure the rydberg constant a 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value give a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 due to the small percentage error but an uncertainty which do n't include the accepted value with slight improvement this method can produce accurate and precise measurement for the rydberg constant however in it current state the procedure give result which do n't agree with the accepted value the main reason for this inaccuracy be that it be difficult to read the scale on the grate spectrometer a it be too small this be not help by the fact that we have to constantly squint our eye to try to read the value of the scale with only a very bright desk lamp over the scale if a digital grate spectrometer be use then the measurement would be much more accurate furthermore it be difficult to place the crosshair in the centre of the spectral line when it be rotate to the `` x `` position i feel it might have be easy to place the crosshair in the centre if it be rotate to the `` `` position this adjustment would try and use the vertical line of the `` `` to bisect the spectral line by move the telescope when the spectral line be bisect the crosshair would be in the middle of the spectral line moreover this inaccuracy could be due to the fact the hydrogen vapour lamp continued to overheat which cause the spectral line to slowly fade a the intensity of the spectral line decrease it become more difficult to see through the telescope and thus more difficult to take accurate reading this problem could be eliminate by use hydrogen vapour lamp with well cool we also consider the width of the spectral line a possible uncertainty however when we attempt to measure the width it be too small to measure with the scale on the grate spectrometer due to the fact the grate spectrometer be a very precise measure device the width of the spectral line be consider a negligible if a wider slit be use the spectral line would have be wider and thus the width may not have be negligible however this would have cause the sharpness and contrast of the line to be lose meaning it would have be more difficult to take accurate reading 1 http //ws680 nist.gov/publication/get pdf.cfm pub id=9206 87 2 http //socratic.org/questions/what-is-the-frequency-oflimiting-line-in-balmer-series\"\n"," \"we have use diffraction grate spectrometry to measure the wavelength of the spectral line of hydrogen and determine the rydberg constant we have found the spectral line to correspond to the balmer series with wavelength of 660±10 nm for the red light and 490± 6 nm for the green light we calculate the rydberg constant heavy nucleus in air which we found to be 1090 ± 10 × 10 4 m −1 our measurement be 0.637 off the currently accepted value of 10973731.56859 10 ±9 × 10 −10 m −1 for the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 off the calculate value of 10960797 ± 10 m −1 for the rydberg constant in air both accepted value be within our range of uncertainty t he rydberg constant relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of an atom during electron transition to the the number denote the energy level between which the electron transition rydberg measure this constant to be 107,921.6 cm -1 1 the rydberg be first measure experimentally by janne rydberg a a constant common to each spectral series for the hydrogen atom 1 however this constant also arises a a consequence of a fundamental quantum mechanical effect namely the quantisation of energy level of the atom by apply the quantum mechanical atomic model to the hydrogen atom and quantise it electron energy level niels bohr be able to derive the rydberg constant theoretically 2 therefore the calculation of the rydberg constant be not only of importance to spectrometry but to the verification of the quantum mechanical model of the atom propose by bohr contrary to rydberg 's initial assumption the actual value of the rydberg constant varies between element depend on the mass of their nucleus 1 however for element whose nucleus be much heavier than an electron the rydberg factor r ∞ be approximately constant the rydberg constant for heavy atom have be measure experimentally to a high accuracy to be r ∞ 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 -10 m -1 3 in this experiment we aim to measure the rydberg constant use diffraction grate spectrometry we will examine the spectral emission line of hydrogen through a grate spectrometer and consequently determine the wavelength of the emission line this will allow u to calculate a value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each wavelength we will then calculate a mean measurement of r h and use it to calculate r ∞ we compare our measure value to curently accepted value of the rydberg constant a well a discus the condition affect the constant such a the permittivity of free space the main apparatus use in this experiment be a grate spectrometer a hydrogen lamp be use to excite hydrogen atom in order to radiate light the grate spectrometer collimates light come from the source through the collimator and directs it through a diffraction grate each wavelength of light diffracts at a different angle thus we achieve a separation of the spectral line of hydrogen emission the angle at which the light ray be diffract be a periodic function of the wavelength a show in fig 2. the difference between the path of the light ray diffract at two adjacent slit distance d apart to the same point on a plane l away from the grate be then from fig 1 equal to r 1 − r 2 thus if the angle between the line connect the midpoint between the slit and the point on the plane of incidence be θ then if the slit separation d be small enough compare to separation of the plane l then r 2 r 1 be approximately true now a r 1 r 2 the path difference be therefore dsin θ assume d l and slit width d then θ θ which be the angular displacement between the consecutive order if the two light ray be to interfere constructively the path difference between them must be an integer multiple of the wavelength therefore where m be the order of maximum intensity and λ be the wavelength plot sine of the angular displace for each order against the order number we obtain a straight line whose gradient be λ/d and a we know the separation d we can calculate the value of λ for each spectral line the rydberg constant be an empirical constant calculate upon analyse the spectral line series of an element such a the balmer series for hydrogen emission spectrum 5 these series take the form where λ be the wavelength of radiation r ∞ be the rydberg constant for heavy element and n f and n i be integer characterise the spectral line and the series respectively 6 however the rydberg constant also arises when bohr 's quantum mechanical theory of the atom 1 be apply to the hydrogen atom 2 bohr 's derivation be base upon planck 's theory of the quantisation of radiation from an atom which state that atom only radiate energy which be integer multiple of a fundamental quantity this may be mathematically write a follow where e be the radiation energy ν be it 's frequency h be planck 's constant and n be an integer multiple 8 9 bohr 's model proposes that electron can exist in stable quantise circular 2 orbit around the atom without radiate energy where the centripetal force be provide by the coulomb attraction force therefore if an electron transition from a high energy n th i orbit to a low energy n th f orbit then by consider the energy of each orbit a the sum of the potential and kinetic energy of the electron the difference in energy between the orbit ∆e be then give by 3 where m e be the electron mass e be the electron charge 0 be the permittivity of free space and h be planck 's constant 10 a the difference in energy be equal to the frequency of radiation multiply by planck 's constant 8 where c be the speed of light in a vacuum and λ be the wavelength of radiation finally we get where with r ∞ be the rydberg constant for large nucleus a the ratio of the mass of the electron to the proton be too large compare to the accuracy of the measurement of the rydberg constant the ratio be approximately m p /m e 1836 11 the mass of the proton must be take into account when find the rydberg constant for hydrogen this be in order to account for the motion of the nucleus however all that be need to account for the difference be to replace the term m e with µ where µ be the reduce mass for the protonelectron system 12 where with m n be the mass of the proton or the nucleus thus our calculate value of rydberg constant becomes r h denotes the rydberg 's constant for the hydrogen atom which be in fact the value of rydberg constant we will measure from the gradient of the graph of our experiment to obtain the value of r ∞ we use the follow equation this experiment be perform use a spectrometer and hydrogen lamp light from the hydrogen lamp be pas through a light collimator which directs the light ray through the diffraction grate and into a telescope the spectrometer 's telescope be focus use an object 5 meter away to ensure sharpness of image a sodium lamp be use to align the collimator and telescope with the slit use the telescope 's cross-hair the width of the slit be chosen a a compromise between light intensity and sharpness of image the diffraction grate be then adjust to be perpendicular to the path of light between the collimator and telescope this be do by turn the telescope by exactly 90 degree from original alignment position with a mirror instead of the diffraction grate in place the mirror be then adjust until it be at exactly 45 degree to the telescope with the image from the mirror exactly at the centre of the cross-hair the mirror be then turn by 45 degree opposite to ensure it 's perpendicular to original align line of sight the mirror be then replace with the grate and telescope be turn back to original position the orientation of the grate in the vertical plane be also adjust by adjust the height and orientation of the grate stage so that the light ray pas exactly through the centre of the grate and appear in the centre of the telescope lens this be test by check that the image do not tilt or move up or down a the telescope be rotate the adjustment be do in order to prevent the diffract light ray from deviate vertically away from the plane of the telescope lens a well a tilt of the image which would increase uncertainty in it position another reason for ensure alignment be to prevent the light ray from hit the telescope at an angle to the horizontal plane which would reduce the accuracy of our approximate model in equation 2 a number of diffraction grate with different number of slit per millimetre be try to find the optimal grate to use for our experiment for each grate the angle between the first two maximum be measure a displayed in table 1. we settle on the 300 slit per millimetre grate a a compromise between have a suitable number of maximum per degree turn while each degree turn be itself large enough in order to reduce the uncertainty a well a have large enough resolve power for each spectral line the telescope be turn in both direction to measure the angle between the initial position and the maximum of each order a show in fig 2. for each maximum the angular width of the image appear in the telescope be measure twice by my lab partner and myself and the average width calculate to determine the uncertainty in our angular measurement for each wavelength we only take 5 measurement a beyond that the light be too dim to take any more accurate measurement of the angular displacement iv result 1 wavelength of spectral line a we plot sine of the angular displacement against the order the gradient of the graph be the wavelength λ divide by the slit width d. from fig 3 the gradient of the green line 0.148 ± 0.002 dimensionless the gradient of the red line 0.197 ± 0.003 dimensionless for each line the relationship between the gradient g and the wavelength follow the equation the width of each slit in the grate be 1/300 mm 3.33×10 −3 ± 1×10 −5 mm consequently the wavelength of the red light similarly the green light 's wavelength λ green be the uncertainty in each value of sin θ in term of θ where θ be the angular displacement be give by σ where with σ θ be the angular width of each maximum in our measurement for each colour σ θ be approximately constant for the red light σ θ 4 arc minute a measure by my lab partner and myself while for the green light σ θ 7 and 5 arc minute with a mean value of 6 arc minute this be all take into account when compute the error on the gradient 2 arc minute be also add in order to account for uncertainty in angle measurement on both edge of the image assume the error in the slit width and the error on the angular width of each maximum be linearly independent then the error on the wavelength σ λ be therefore give in term of the uncertainty in the gradient and in slit width σ g and σ d respectively through 2 rydberg constant calculation the wavelength of the light ray observe correspond more closely to the balmer series than to any other series 5 therefore n f to equal 2 while n i be 3 for red and 4 for green in equation 3 for the rydberg constant for red light n i 3 and n f 2. the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h be give by 4 use equation 3 the weight mean for r h be thus a discus in the theoretical section to find the rydberg constant for heavy nucleus r ∞ we use equation 11 with m e be the electron mass and m p be the proton mass the ratio m p /m e be experimentally measure to be 1836.152470 76 11 thus our calculate value of r ∞ be with a range of therefore our value of the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom and the rydberg constant for heavy element be indistinguishable due to the high uncertainty associate with each value the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 −10 m −1 which fall within our uncertainty range this mean our measure value have a mean percentage error of 0.638 4 all uncertainty calculation be include in the appendix our measure range of value for the rydberg constant agrees experimentally with the currently accepted value a it fall within our range however a number of random and systematic error that our uncertainty on the value be discus below the rydberg constant be a function of the permittivity of free space a discus in the theory section the permittivity of free space itself varies with pressure and humidity 13 therefore the permittivity of free space in our laboratory be different to the permittivity of free space in a vacuum upon which the accepted value of the rydberg constant be base the ratio of absolute permittivity of air to permittivity of a vacuum also know a relative permittivity be currently measure to be 1.00058986 ± 0.00000050 14 this mean that r ∞ in air at standard pressure and temperature be 5 this value be still within our range of expect value of r ∞ however the mean percentage error be reduce from 0.638 to 0.547 another major source of systematic uncertainty be background light presence of background light would cause the width of the observe image to be small a the eye becomes less sensitive to light this would force u to use a large slit width in order to increase brightness of image which would produce a less sharp image with large uncertainty in position it also meant that we could obtain few data point a the image become much dimmer for maximum of order high than 3 and less than -2. this assymetry in the data in itself suggests that background light from one direction be conceal the maximum at the order of -3. it also meant that we could not make any accurate measurement of the blue spectral line with n f =5 one blue spectral be observe at an angle of about -8 degree however the line be too dim to make any accurate measurement regard it position or to find any other blue spectral line theoretically the telescope have to be focus at infinity however we could only use a 5-metre-away object for focus due to the dimension and capacity of the laboratory room this meant that the telescope may have not be perfectly focus and a defocus aberration along the optical axis of the telescope might have occur this would mean that the image be stretch out with a large uncertainty in position while all care have be take to ensure the alignment of the spectrometer a discus in the method section small deviation from alignment would lead to light fall at a vertical angle to the telescopic lens from fig 1 the path of light would be shift vertically i.e out of the paper in the figure this mean light would travel a distance r 2 or r 1 plus some vertical distance k. the path difference δ thus becomes if k=0 this simply reduces to dsin θ for k not equal to zero the path difference approximation a dsin θ becomes less accurate if k or the vertical misalignment be comparable to the separation of the slit and the telescope the uncertainty due to this add approximate becomes significantly large our experiment be aim at measure the rydberg constant by analyse the balmer series for hydrogen use a diffraction grate spectrometer we measure the wavelength of two of the spectral colour of the series the wavelength of the red colour be measure to be 660 ± 10 nm while the wavelength of the green colour be measure to be 490 ± 6nm these value be use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom which we found to be 1090 ± 10 × 10 4 m −1 we then use bohr 's atomic model formula for rydberg 's constant and found that the difference between the rydberg constant for hydrogen and that for heavy element be small than we could detect due to the size of our uncertainty in measurement in angular displacement the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 −10 m −1 in a vacuum and 10960797 ± 11 m −1 in air thus imply a mean percentage error of 0.638 on our measurement compare to the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 compare to the rydberg constant in air we have also calculate the rydberg constant in air at standard temperature and pressure use value for rydberg constant and relative permittivity from literature 14 at 10960797 ±11m −1 both of these value fall within our range of uncertainty for the rydberg constant if the experiment be to be repeat the most significant improvement to be make be improve isolation from background light such a run the experiment in a dark room with no external light or cover the collimator cover the collimator with a dark cloth would prevent external light from appear with the image reduce background light would allow for the gathering of the blue spectral line data this data could then be use to determine another value for the rydberg constant and hence improve the accuracy of the mean value it would also allow for the gathering of more data point for high order which would lead to reduce uncertainty due to random error another improvement would be the use of a diffraction grate with a wider slit a it would create more maximum per angular displacement and more data point can be gather this would reduce the effect of random error however it would also reduce the resolve power of the grate and thus introduce another uncertainty in the position of the maximum a grate with 150 slit per mm could thus be a well compromise between resolve power and number of data point over the 300 slit per mm grate we use use the same type of diffraction grate spectrometry analyse the spectral line of various element could be use to verify the relationship between r ∞ and the mass of the nucleus in order to verify bohr 's atomic model 's accuracy a state in equation 8 the uncertainty on the wavelength be give by thus for red light the uncertainty be similarly the uncertainty in the green light 's wavelength be the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h a calculate use the red light 's wavelength be give by σ r where 2 the uncertainty on the weight mean for the rydberg constant for hydrogen σ r h be give by the sum of the inverse of the error square which bohr 's model assumes that electron rotate around the hydrogen nucleus in fix quantise orbit the electron do not radiate any energy less than the difference between the energy level they 're occupy and any other energy level a the electron be rotate in almost circular orbit the centripetal force f centripetal be supply by the coulomb attraction force and give by 12 where 0 be the permittivity of free space e be the charge of the electron or the proton and r be the radius of the orbit we then have where m e be the electron mass and v it 's velocity a the orbit be quantise the angular momentum l n of the n th orbit be therefore also quantise this mean that for each orbit the angular momentum be an integral multiple of the reduce planck constant h. therefore we have where r n be the radius of the orbit and v n be the velocity of the electron in the orbit 12 solve equation 35 and 36 for r n and v n we get and we can now use these expression to work out the total energye total the energy of the orbit be give in term of kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p by 12 which be this reduces to a n be an integral value characterise each orbit if the electron start at orbit with n n i and end on orbit with n= n f the difference in energy be then give by ∆e where the rydberg constant be give by 2 let r ∞ air be the rydberg constant in air while r ∞ be the rydberg constant in a vacuum while air be the permittivity of free space in air while 0 be the permittivity of free space in a vacuum from equation 44 the ratio of the permittivity of free space in air to that in a vacuum be know a the relative permittivity r\"\n"," \"an optical spectrometer be an instrument use to study property of light by measure the intensity of one or more

direction the direction of these light beam depend on the slit separation d of the grate and the wavelength of the light a diffraction grate can split polychromatic light into it component colour this be very similar to the double slit experiment the main difference be the small slit separation of grate the major cause of the phenomenon of grate be diffraction the slight bending of light a it pas around the edge of an object the amount of bending depends on the wavelength λ of light and the slit separation d. if the separation be much large than wavelength the bending will be unnoticeable whereas if the wavelength be close in size or equal with the grate space there be considerable amount of bending which can be observe easily figure 1 a beam of white light be separate by the grate 2 the grate can be consider a many small slit with equal separation d that must be great than the wavelength of interest to cause diffraction after interact with the grate the diffract light consists of the sum of interfere wave component the path distance from the slit at any point in space which the diffract ray may pa could vary due to the difference in path length the phase difference of wave at

in figure 4. figure 4 the setup for the apparatus of this experiment in this graph the darker part be moveable and the grey part be fix before measure the spectrometer must be set up properly to make repeatable and accurate measurement there be a cross wire in the telescope the eyepiece of the telescope must be focus on the cross wire the collimator must be align with the axis of telescope the screw can adjust the height of the telescope the main scale be in vernier scale the reading be in arc minute the screw on the table can adjust the telescope by a slight angle all the luminaires except the sodium lamp should be turn off to get a clear image of the spectral line the spectral line must be aim to the middle of cross wire to get a precious measurement the spectrometer have a precision about ±0.2 nm in this experiment this be very small compare to other error like curve fitting error thus it be neglectable another systematic error stem from measurement of angle the precision the vernier protractor be ±0.016° the uncertainty in calculate sinθ could be work out use equation sin error in θ which be 0.79 the error cause when aim the spectral line to the cross wire be also important it be very difficult to align the cross wire with the spectral line with other effect like parallax defocus lamp position and background light the total random error be about 1.00 there be also error in plot and curve fitting these error be calculate use python there be two different type of spectral line appear blue line and red line for the blue line the plot be a show below figure 5

the accepted value 10973731.6 m -1 be within the range of both result there be a few improvement that could have be make during the experiment for instance reading could have be take by turn off the other light source this would have allow a great number of point plot to calculate a more accurate gradient and reduce error in curve fitting\"\n"," \"the aim of the experiment be to determine a value for the rydberg constant the rydberg constant be obtain use a hydrogen lamp and a diffraction grate with 300 line per mm diffraction angle of hydrogen balmer emission line be measure allow the wavelength of the light to be calculate the value of the rydberg constant could subsequently be determine the value obtain be r ∞ 1.069±0.151 ×10 7 m -1 the accepted value be 1.097×10 7 m -1 1 which be within the uncertainty range of the measure value this suggests i obtain accurate result the large uncertainty on the value i obtain be due to the method of error analysis i use on the red and purple emission line n 1889 johannes rydberg developed a formula which relates the energy level of an atom to the wavelength of photon emit when electron transition between those level the rydberg constant be a proportionality constant between these variable 2 it be important that an accurate value of this constant be measure so that physicist can calculate the wavelength of photon emit when electron transition within an atom know the number of energy level they move through in the experiment light from a hydrogen lamp be shone through a 300 line per mm diffraction grate and the spectrometer be use to find different emission line the angle of the emission line relative to the zero-order fringe be then measure allow the wavelength of the light to be calculate the rydberg constant can then be determine from the rydberg equation a diffraction grate consists of a series of equally space parallel narrow slit when white light be shone through the grate it diffracts through each slit and interferes with light diffract through other slit the result be a series of alternate bright and dark fringe with each bright fringe except for the central fringe form a spectrum of visible light a each frequency of light diffracts at different angle the angle of each bright fringe to the normal be define by where m be the order of the fringe λ be the wavelength of the light d be the slit separation and θ be the angle of each fringe to the normal 3 in excite hydrogen atom electron occupy energy level great than the low energy level electron transition from the third energy level or high down to the second energy level emit photon with energy equal to the energy change in the transition 2 this mean electron at different initial energy level will emit photon of different colour therefore when this light be shone through a diffraction grate a series of colour emission line call the hydrogen balmer line be form at each fringe the follow equation relates the number of energy level in the electron transition to the wavelength of the emit light where λ be the wavelength of the light 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant n be the initial energy level of the electron n 3,4,5… and p be the final energy level of the electron p=2 3 by use a grate spectrometer to measure the angle between an emission line and the normal λ can be calculate from equation 1 provide the fringe order and the slit separation be know the rydberg constant can then be found from equation 2 a n can be determine from the colour of the emission line 3 iii method the equipment be set up a in figure 1. before the experiment be undertaken the spectrometer be set up so that clear focus image could be see to reduce eye strain the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire the camera lens be then focus on an determination of the rydberg constant i object position 5-10 m away until no parallax be see between the cross wire and the object the telescope be subsequently align with the collimator and the hydrogen lamp be turn on i position the hydrogen lamp ~1cm from the slit so that the image would be bright then look through the telescope i change the focus of the collimator until a sharp image of the slit be see centre at the crosswire finally the slit width be decrease to ensure a great diffraction of light so that a sharper emission line would be see 3 the angle of the telescope be measure from the vernier scale and the telescope be then move through 90ᵒ and fix in position a diffraction grate with a rating of 300 line per mm and a slit separation of 3.33×10 -6 m be place in the holder the grate with the small slit separation be chosen to produce large diffraction angle which would make the emission line easy to differentiate from one another the grate table be then rotate until a reflect image of the slit be see in the telescope this denote that the grate surface be 45ᵒ to the axis of the collimator the reading from the vernier scale be note and use to rotate the grate through another 45ᵒ until it be normal to the incident beam 3 the telescope be rotate until the slit image be centre on the cross hair my partner and myself both measure the angle and set the average of our reading a the 0 point this be to reduce the error in the reading and to give u a valid method of calculate the error we then repeat this method of measurement for the emission line and use the difference between the angle of the emission line and the angle of the incident beam a the diffraction angle in total 3 colour be visible-red green and purple 4 green fringe be found m= -2 to m= 2 and 2 red and purple fringe respectively m= -1 to m= 1 equation 1 show that a graph of sinθ against λ would be linear by multiply the gradient of the line by the slit separation λ be determine this can then be use in equation 2 to get a value of the rydberg constant 3 therefore 3 value of the rydberg constant be obtained-1 for each colour an average value be calculate from the 3 value to reduce the error on the result i identify 3 major source of systematic error in the experiment there would clearly be uncertainty due to the resolution of the vernier scale ᵒ due to the fact there be uncertainty in the 0 position and the final measure value there would also be some uncertainty due to the thickness of the emission line which we measure to be ᵒ however because this be small than the resolution error it will not factor into the analysis finally error would be create through the difficulty in see the emission lines-this effect be bad for the red and purple line a they be n't a bright a the green line i quantify this error a where σθ be the error in the angle measure and θ 1 and θ 2 be the angle measure by each experimenter the error on each measure angle σθ be calculate from equation 3 unless the value be small than the resolution error in which case that be use a the error on the measure angle in far analysis the diffraction angle be calculate a the difference between the angle of the emission line and the angle of the incident beam and it error be give by where σθ d be the error in the diffraction angle σθ be the error in the angle measure and σθ 0 be the error in the angle measure when the telescope be align with the axis of the collimator figure 2,3 and 4 below show the linear relationship between sinθ d and m. the error in sinθ d be use to create the error bar and be give by here σsinθ d be the error in the sine of the diffraction angle fig 1. diagram of the grate spectrometer use in the experiment a grate with a rating of 300 line per mm be use 3 for the green light the plot software calculate a gradient with an associate error of 0.14478916± 8.01775860×10 -4 for the red and purple light the plot software calculate gradient of 0.19921648 and 0.1325 respectively however the software be unable to produce error for these gradient a i only manage to obtain 2 result each for these colour meaning a covariance matrix could not be form to calculate the error i plot the steepest and shallowest possible line of best fit passing through all the error bar on figure 3 and 4. i then determine the error a where g be the steepest possible line of best fit gradient and g be the shallowest possible line of best fit gradient use equation 6 i obtain an error of ±0.054 for red and ±0.045 for purple the error in the wavelength can then be calculate use where σλ be the error in the wavelength and σ gradient be the error in the gradient the error in the rydberg constant for each colour can then be calculate by the value of the rydberg constant obtain be r ∞ 1.105±0.006 ×10 7 m -1 for green r ∞ 1.084±0.294 ×10 7 m -1 for red r ∞ 1.019±0.346 ×10 7 m -1 for purple a final value of the rydberg constant can be calculate a an average of these 3 result with the error give by where σr ∞mean be the error on the final result and σ r σ p and σ g be the error on the rydberg constant for red purple and green light respectively the final result i obtain be r ∞ 1.069±0.151 ×10 7 m -1 the theoretical value be 1.097×10 7 m -1 1 which be within the uncertainty range of the measure value suggest the measure value be accurate however the error on it be very large it be evident that this large error be cause by the large error in the gradient of the red and purple light which be cause by the method of error analysis i use for these colour this would also explain why the error for the red and purple light be so much large than the green light despite the error bar on figure 2,3 and 4 look relatively consistent-although a large error would be expect a there be few result for red and purple this lack of result be cause by the hydrogen lamp overheat and dim after we measure the green line meaning by the time we measure the red and purple emission line only the 1 st order fringe be visible this could have be prevent by measure all the 1 st order fringe together and all the 2 nd order fringe together ideally the experiment could have also go on for longer which would have allow time for the hydrogen lamp to cool and be reuse to measure the 2 nd order fringe for the red and purple emission line another problem with the experiment be the light generate by other group lamp which make the emission line harder to see the error generate by this will be account for in equation 3 this could be correct by repeat the experiment with no other group present the large source of error be likely to come from the difficulty in see the emission line and possible parallax in measure the vernier scale this be highlight by the fact the error calculate from equation 3 be mostly large than the resolution error for each data set the aim of the experiment be to calculate a value for the rydberg constant this be do by use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer to measure the diffraction angle of hydrogen balmer line this allow λ to be calculate and subsequently a value for the rydberg constant to be obtain the average value of the rydberg constant i produce be r ∞ 1.069±0.151 ×10 7 m -1 the theoretical value of 1.097×10 7 m -1 be within the uncertainty range of the average measure value this suggests the result be accurate which will be because of the high-resolution vernier scale use a well a the procedure take to ensure a focus sharp image be produce such a place the hydrogen lamp ~1cm from the slit which be narrow a much a possible however the value have a large associate error which will be primarily due to the fact the hydrogen lamp be dim and overheat when the purple and red line measurement be make this meant only the 1 st order fringe of each be visible meaning a different method of error analysis be need for the red and purple light which yield large error to improve the experiment it could be repeat in a completely dark room with no other group and with enough time to obtain more result for red and purple light\"\n"," \"in this experiment we aim to measure the value of the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer we measure the emission spectrum of hydrogen by measure the angle of different order emission line in the three most prominent colour by plot the sine of the angle against the order to find the wavelength of the colour and then use the rydberg formula we found the value of the rydberg constant to be 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f this be fairly accurate but lack precision the main source of uncertainty be the broadness of the spectral line which cause a large uncertainty in the angle this may have also introduce systematic error into the value he aim of the experiment be to calculate the value of the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer a grate spectrometer produce a collimate beam of light by passing a light from a source through a narrow slit and make it parallel use a collimate lens the beam of light then pas through a diffraction grate at normal incidence and this disperse spectrum be focus and view with an eyepiece the diffraction grate can be consider a many thin slit that be equally space apart simplify this to resemble young 's double slit experiment it can be see that for light passing through the grate principal maximum occur when the phase difference between ray be integer multiple of 2π the difference between these experiment be that a diffraction grate allows more light to pa through and the maximum occur when they be all constructively interfere meaning the maximum be much brighter a see in figure 2. the phase difference between neighbour ray be give by the fraction of the wavelength displace multiply by 2π where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the light ray since the phase difference be an integer multiple m of 2π we can write the above equation a from the inset in figure 1 the path difference can be write a 𝑑 sin 𝜃 where d be the distance between neighbour slit and 𝜃 be the angle move through from the axis of the collimator therefore the equation becomes mλ 𝑑 sin 𝜃. to find the wavelength a graph of sin 𝜃 against m can be plot and the value of the gradient will be λ the wavelength can be found by multiply the gradient by the slit separation how the wavelength relates to the rydberg constant will be outline in theory section ii transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by the formula where n represent the initial energy state of the atom p represent the final energy state of the atom and 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant for this experiment the balmer series will be use because it be in the visible part of the spectrum and can measure the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer t be observe use a spectrometer in this series p=2 which mean that the will drop down from the n th to the second energy level and the difference in energy will give off a photon of a specific wavelength the value of n can be determine by look at the measure value of the wavelength this be due to the planck-einstein relation which state that 𝐸 ℎ𝑓 or 𝐸 ℎ 𝑐 𝜆 where e be the difference in energy h be planck 's constant f be the frequency and c be the speed of light in a vacuum from this we can see that the difference in energy be inversely proportional to the wavelength and therefore the small difference in energy from n=3 to p=2 will correspond to the big wavelength use the measure value of the wavelength and the correspond value of n the rydberg constant can be calculate use the rydberg formula the first step be to set up the spectrometer so it be properly align and focus this be imperative for accurate and precise measurement the eyepiece be focus so that an object around 5 metre away be focus on the cross wire the telescope camera lens and eyepiece be align with the axis of the collimator and a sodium lamp be switch on and position close behind the slit a sodium lamp be use for the set up because it can be switch on for longer than hydrogen and allows for all set-up measurement to be make the focus of the collimator be adjust so that a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire the reading of the vernier scale be take so a `` 0° `` angle be note a see in table 1. the telescope be move through 90° and a mirror be insert in the diffraction grate holder the grate table be turn back until a reflect image of the slit in the mirror be see through the eyepiece which meant that the grate surface be at 45° to the incident beam from the collimator this angle be note the grate table be then move again through precisely 45° so it be accurately set at a new `` 0° `` normal incidence this angle will be use a the zero point for all measurement the mirror be replace with a diffraction grate and the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp finally the spectral line be observe through the telescope to ensure the spectrometer be set up correctly two different diffraction grate be use to observe the spectral line in the preliminary measurement one be approximately 78.8 line per mm and the other be 300 line per mm it be see that the different order line be much more disperse in the 300 line per mm a see in figure 4 and be of high intensity meaning that individual spectral line be much clearer and more distinct from other line when use the 300 line per mm grate this grate be kept in the holder and be use for the rest of the experiment another observation be that there be only three colour red aqua and blue that be clear enough to measure and that spectral line with order great than two be extremely difficult to measure therefore data be take for these three colour with order m=-2 to m=2 in addition the zero th order spectral line be in the same position for each colour so one measurement be sufficient for all colour intermittently an array of unusual colour be see through the eyepiece cause by desk lamp switch on and off around the room a a result the spectrometer be shield from external light use black card and the hydrogen lamp be move closer to the slit the centre of each spectral line for the three colour from m=-2 to m=2 be measure by each lab partner to reduce human error and to give a value for the statistical `` 0° `` angle 168° 44 `` 90° `` angle 78° 44 `` 45° `` angle 340° 58 new `` 0° `` angle 169° 04 e=hf e=hf uncertainty however a big source of be the width of the spectral line because 𝜃 could lie anywhere within that width accord to the bohr model spectral line should not have thickness because the value for energy be discrete however due to various effect broadening of spectral line occur effect such a natural broadening pressure broadening and opacity broadening can all increase the line thickness but the most considerable broadening in the visible spectrum be due to thermal doppler broadening 1 this be when hydrogen gas be hot so atom move with different velocity and therefore have different frequency due to the doppler shift this then result in a wider range of frequency and broadens the spectral line the only way to reduce this would be to cool hydrogen gas to very low temperature which be not possible for this experiment consequently the start and end of each spectral line be also measure and average to find the uncertainty of the angle a graph of sin 𝜃 against m be plot for the three colour red aqua and blue the width of the spectral line be measure to be 0.3° 1s.f so the uncertainty in the angle be ±0.2° 1s.f the uncertainty in the gradient be calculate by plot a graph of maximum gradient and minimum gradient for each colour and then calculate half of the difference between them this be carry through to the error in wavelength where the fractional error of the gradient and the slit separation would have be add in quadrature however error in the slit separation if any would be extremely small a the slit separation be approximately 3 × 10 −6 so this error be deem negligible therefore the fractional error of the gradient be simply multiply by the wavelength to obtain the uncertainty in the wavelength compare these value to the know value a see in figure 6 they be fairly accurate and within the range of the uncertainty this show that the correct error be account for this be far discus in the latter part of this section see a the wavelength for red be the large and the wavelength for blue be the small it can be infer from the planck-einstein relation that for red n=3 for aqua n=4 and for blue n=5 substitute this into the rydberg formula the follow result be achieve table 3. result for the rydberg constant for red aqua and blue spectral line and the calculate average rydberg constant the error in the rydberg constant for each colour be calculate use the derivative of the rydberg formula multiply by the error of the wavelength the follow formula be use where 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ be the error in the rydberg constant and 𝜎 𝜆 be the error in the wavelength the fractional error of the rydberg constant for the three colour be then add in quadrature to obtain the error for the average rydberg constant therefore the final value for the rydberg constant be 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f this differs from the know value of 10973731.6 m -1 which be approximately 100000 m -1 less than the value found in this experiment the know value be within the uncertainty meaning that the error be account for the difference be most likely due to the wrong angle of the spectral line be measure a only the midpoint of a range of angle be note down however the gradient wavelength red 0.196±0.002 653±7nm aqua 0.145±0.002 482±7nm blue 0.129±0.002 430±7nm difference could also be due to human error when reading the angle off the vernier scale the angle could be interpret differently by separate people because where the vernier scale aligns with the main scale can be difficult to see also the aqua blue colour at high order become very faint and be much harder to place at the crosswire which may have result in slightly erroneous measurement this result have a percentage error of 2.7 which be very high see the equipment use be extremely precise the value of this error come from the measure value of the width of the spectral line which be 0.3° this width could not be decrease a it be due to local condition around the element which be uncontrollable with the available resource therefore this be the best precision possible to improve more advanced technology could be use to decrease the spectral line broadness and find more precise value for wavelength and the rydberg constant the fact that all three value for the rydberg constant be high than the know value suggests a systematic error this could have be due to several effect some more likely than others least likely would be spectrometer misalignment and defocus because the setup and preliminary check be do carefully and rigorously however a calibration error may have be overlook there may have be an error in the diffraction grate such a too little or too many line however this be also unlikely a they be of professional quality the lamp position and background light do affect the experiment initially but solution to these problem be quickly found the solution may have be inadequate but the position of spectral line would not have be affected by this greatly most likely be temperature air pressure and humidity which may have shift frequency and make them large meaning the centre of the spectral line measure may have give a small wavelength and therefore a large rydberg constant overall the aim of the experiment be to calculate the value of the rydberg constant the method use involve measure the angle of hydrogen spectral line and calculate the wavelength by use path difference and phase difference formula and plot a graph from this the rydberg constant be calculate use the rydberg formula and the constant be found to be 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f this value be accurate but not very precise when compare to the know value of 10973731.6 m -1 the lack of precision be cause by the broadness of the spectral line which increase the uncertainty and may have cause systematic error to improve more consideration can be take to reduce the thickness of the spectral line and well evaluation of potential systematic error can be make overall the experiment calculate the rydberg constant accurately because the know value be within the range of the measure value and successfully demonstrate many aspect of spectroscopy\"\n"," \"the rydberg constant rh be measure use a grate spectrometer to determine the wavelength of different colour on the hydrogen emission spectrum these colour be use with the transition in energy level they

the study of emission spectrum be greatly simplify with hydrogenic nucleus hydrogen consist of only one proton and one electron analyse this most simple emission spectrum with an instrument capable of high precision the grate spectrometer allows very accurate empirical determination the wavelength of each colour fringe be found from the follow equation where d represent the slit separation m the

'blue will refer to transition 4 → 2 and 'dark blue/purple will refer to transition 5 → 2 a show in figure 1. light from a lamp be aim through a single slit before be collimate through a lens/collimator the light be then disperse through the grate before be refocus through the camera to the eyepiece the eyepiece could then be rotate to observe the position of different fringe the angle through which the light be bent and thus the position of each fringe depend on the width of the slit in the grate related in equation 2. for the repeatability of result and proper calibration the follow apparatus set-up procedure be follow the eyepiece and the crosshair be align and focus on an object around 5m away to eliminate parallax between the image and crosshair the telescope compose of the camera lens and eyepiece be angle so that it be parallel with the collimator the collimator focus be then alter to give an image of maximum clarity the telescope be then rotate through exactly 90° a measure on the angular scale the grate be place in it holder on the turntable of the spectrometer and adjust so that the collimate light pas through it the grate use be 78.8 line per mm the turntable be then rotate until a reflect image of the entrance slit be directly behind the crosshair give an angle of exactly 45° which be record before the turntable be rotate through exactly 45° thus set to 0° rotate in either direction from this zero reference allow angular position of fringe to be determine with rotation in opposite direction have opposite sign define one direction a positive meant reading could take both side of zero give more data with which to plot a graph thus reduce uncertainty in the gradient of each graph the fringe number and colour with it associate angular displacement be record in degree and arc minute for each fringe these value be then convert to radian before a graph of sin θ m against m be plot for each colour give gradient a λ d a d represent the distance between slit which be the inverse of line density of the grate the wavelength of the fringe could be calculate use equation 4 r h can then be found from equation 2 it be clear that a graph of sin θ m against fringe order m should show a linear relationship both red and blue plot show this after plot the blue result figure 4 it be notice that all point have a similar gradient but there be a step in value between the m=0 and m=1 fringe this imply incorrect label of fringe number by change point m=1,2 to point m=2,3 respectively the far more concordant graph be plot show in figure 5. the difference become even more apparent on plot the residual of the original and correct plot a in figure 6. the variance of the correct residual be 7 time small than that of the uncorrected plot 2.81×10 −5 v 1.97×10 −4 strongly improve quality of the line of best fit and the final result fig 6 residual for both blue plot calculate by subtract y coordinate of each point from the position of the line of best fit at that same point from the gradient of these figure the wavelength of red fringe be calculate a 661 ± 8 nm consistent with table i and the blue wavelength be calculate a 510 ± 20 nm meaning the accepted value be narrowly outside the range of experimental uncertainty the value of r h be determine a 1.09±0.01 ×10 7 m −1 use the calculate red wavelength and 1.05 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 use the calculate blue wavelength give a final value of 1.07 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 meaning the accepted value of 1.10×10 7 m −1 1 be within range of the experimental error of the calculate result a major shortcoming of this study be an insufficient number of result for dark blue/purple fringe allow only two value for r h to be found this difficulty be probably due to the closeness of first order fringe simply masking/blurring the position of individual fringe this mean that there be so much overlap between fringe it be hard to identify where one fringe end and another begin a way to reduce this effect in the future would be to use a grate with a great line density reduce slit separation d. from equation 2 it be see that would increase the value of sin θ m for each give fringe which for an angle 90°would also be an increase in θ m with each colour spread out by a different angle due to different wavelength this would mean less fringe overlap and well fringe identification a large assumption in the result be the allocation of error the manufacturer-stated uncertainty of the grate spectrometer be impressively small a little a three part in ten thousand 8 the uncertainty in the fringe position be in fact much great than this a the position of the centre of a give fringe be subject to the judgement of the equipment operator this be because the fringe be not a precisely locate extremely small line but a bright section of differ intensity thus error associate with fringe angle be far great than the minimum uncertainty of the spectrometer for the purpose of error bar on our result a modest estimate be use this be found by measure the width of a large fringe a the centre must be contain within the full width of the fringe a large fringe be chosen a use a small fringe could have be an underestimate for large fringe whereas use a large fringe give an overestimate for small fringe it be more responsible to use the overestimate this be quote a the error for every fringe ±0.6° give ±0.01 for uncertainty in sin θ m although this be n't an accurate way of assign uncertainty time constraint do not allow u to take a reading for every fringe thus more advanced error analysis be not available to u it be also large enough to encompass aforementioned error such a that associate with the spectrometer itself and the discrepancy between r h and r ∞ a more suitable way of assign error in the future would involve take two value for each fringe the small and great angle at which the fringe can be see the mean of which give the value to be record this give a more appropriate value for each fringe and particularly for small fringe should reduce uncertainty give a more accurate determination of r h it be worth mention that the value for r h a calculate use only the red fringe be both more accurate and precise than the final value average both the blue and red value with error combine in quadrature this show how remarkably less accurate the blue fringe be than the red this may due to an observational error in result confusion of colour a show in figure 1 the purple/dark blue and light blue fringe appear much more similar than either do with the red consequently it may be true that one or more of the 'blue point in figure 5 belong on a different graph in the future clearly identify colour at the start of the experiment could reduce uncertainty in the result by provide a whole extra set of purple/dark blue data and reduce variance from line of best fit in blue result this could be do by calculate the theoretical angle at which a fringe of each colour would be see use data in table i with equation 2. the telescope could then be adjust to this position and the colour at/nearest this point identify a that colour from table i for future reading all these improvement rely on more time for completion of the experiment a set-up of the equipment take up a large portion of the available time improve the efficiency of set up the equipment would allow more reading to be take increase accuracy in determine value of r h the aim of the experiment be to find an accurate value for the rydberg constant by analysis of the hydrogen emission spectrum use a grate spectrometer upon calculation of the wavelength of two different set of colour fringe and comparison to the balmer series two value for r h be found use the balmer equation vary degree of accuracy and approximately determine error limited reliability however the final result be both accurate and precise with the accepted value 1.10 × 10 7 m −1 within the range of uncertainty of the empirical value 1.07 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 in the case of this experiment be repeat a few simple improvement described in this report should be implement include a well

spectral series the balmer series corresponds to electron transition happen from high energy level down to the second quantum level the transition wavelength of the balmer series be in the visible spectrum 2 the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ be a fundamental constant in the rydberg formula which be a mathematical formula use to predict the transitional wavelength of an atom 3 the rydberg formula be important in the development of quantum mechanic 𝑅 ∞ be important because it be an auxiliary constant which can be represent a a product of other fundamental constant 4 a spectrometer be an instrument use to study the emission and absorption of light by different atomic nucleus it u a prism or diffraction grate to disperse a beam of light into a line spectrum 1 the different colour of light be diffract at different angle on either side of the zero maximum order which be the position in the centre where all the colour of light be in a parallel beam each line corresponds to a separate energy

the error present in the experiment use approximation this include the correction for spectrometer misalignment the lamp position grate period background light and fringe width the hydrogen atom emits four line alpha beta gamma and delta in the visible region of the spectrum in 1885 balmer developed a mathematical relationship call the balmer series to represent the wavelength of these line where r

the rydberg constant and n and p be the principle quantum number and can be represent by any integer 6 p 2 corresponds to the balmer series for a hydrogen atom in 1916 niels bohr introduce the atomic hydrogen model in this model he postulate that an electron be held in a stable circular orbit around the nucleus by an electric force 𝐹 𝐸 give by coulomb 's law where e be the magnitude of the charge

describes electron a tiny particle with a definite trajectory and radius other limitation include be unable to predict the relative intensity of the spectral line and explain the zeeman effect 8 in this experiment 𝑅 ∞ be calculate use equation 2 by measure the wavelength of the balmer series of hydrogen the measurement of the transition wavelength of the balmer series of hydrogen be make use a pasco student spectrometer the setup of the apparatus be show in figure 1. there be three main component of the spectrometer the collimator the diffraction grate and the telescope figure 2 be a schematic diagram which illustrates the work principle of the spectrometer light from the hydrogen lamp enters the collimator through the narrow collimator slit which be locate at the focal point of the collimator lens the light be focus into a narrow parallel beam allow it to strike the diffraction grate at normal incidence a grate be a large number n of equally space slit which have a slit separation d. the diffraction grate work by diffract light equally on both side of the normal at an angle 𝜃. constructive interference occurs when the path difference between neighbour ray be an integer multiple m of the wavelength λ. therefore the path difference can be write a where m be call the order of diffraction equation 13 be know a the grate equation different colour of light be diffract at different angle when the telescope be focus at infinity parallel light ray of a specific colour will enter the telescope and form an image of a slit at the crosshair which be the focal point of the objective lens of the telescope 1 9 a magnify image be view use the eyepiece 2 the arm of the telescope can be rotate to view the various slit of different colour the diffraction angle can be measure use the vernier scale the experimental apparatus be set up carefully to ensure the collimator diffraction grate and telescope be in a straight line to get accurate result and to reduce the uncertainty due to the misalignment of the spectrometer a sodium vapour lamp be use to set up the apparatus the eyepiece be focus on the crosswire and the telescope be place parallel to the axis of the collimator the sodium lamp be place close to the collimator slit and the telescope be adjust until the image of the lamp could be see clearly the angle be read off the vernier scale and this position be set a the origin the telescope arm be then rotate by 90 degree the grate be rotate and adjust until a sharp image of the reflect light could be see through the telescope which meant that the grate be at 45 degree to the telescope the grate be then rotate 45 degree so that it be parallel to the collimator and the camera be rotate 90 degree back to the origin the diffraction grate be place on the grate table a 78.8 line per mm diffraction grate be use in this experiment 2 preliminary data be take by adjust the size of the collimator slit to get a balance between the intensity of the fringe the width of the fringe and the number of order which could be see the collimator slit size be make quite large to increase the number of diffraction order which could be see this result in the fringe have a large width size the hydrogen lamp be switch on and the crosshair be centre at the middle of the white slit which be take a the zeroth order the angle of this position be read off the vernier scale and record a ɵ zero the telescope arm be rotate on either side find a bright fringe the fringe on the right side of the zeroth order be determine to be the positive order and the fringe on the left side be the negative order a show in figure 3. the crosshair be align at the centre of fringe and the angle correspond to the position of the fringe ɵ m be record where m be the order of the fringe the value of 𝜃 be calculate use the equation figure 3. the vernier scale have an uncertainty of ±0.005 degree measurement of ɵ m be take thrice the average value and the standard error of the mean for ɵ m be calculate the telescope arm be rotate so that the crosshair be align on either edge of the fringe and the difference between the angle read off the vernier scale divide by two be take a the uncertainty due to the width of the fringe this be repeat for all the order include the zeroth order the standard error of the mean for ɵ m and the uncertainty due to the fringe width be compare and the big uncertainty be take a the uncertainty of ɵ m the spectrometer be misalign by 2 degree and a few measurement of the position of the first order be take this be do to estimate the uncertainty in 𝜃 cause by the misalignment of the spectrometer the hydrogen lamp be move far away from the collimator lens and the position of the positive first-order be measure the difference between this value measure and ɵ m where m 1 be take a an approximation of the uncertainty in 𝜃 due to the lamp position the experiment be do in a dark room to reduce the uncertainty due to background light the three line which be visible balmer alpha beta and gamma be see a the colour red blue and violet respectively measurement of up to five positive and negative order be take for the red and blue spectral line of the balmer series of hydrogen however the intensity of the purple fringe be not strong enough and only 2 negative order and 4 positive order could be see only three of the four balmer line of hydrogen be visible these be balmer alpha balmer beta and balmer gamma with the wavelength 649 ± 14 nm 486 ± 3 nm and 433 ± 3 nm respectively the fourth line be very dim and no appropriate measurement of it could be take the value of the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ be calculate to be 1.09 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m -1 the line on the 78.8 line per mm diffraction grate be not exactly symmetrical lead to some of the fringe be distort and misalign therefore an approximate value of d with an uncertainty be calculate from another experiment do to calculate the fraunhofer line the angle of the na fraunhofer line be obtain use the same spectrometer and diffraction grate the value of d be then calculate use equation 13 by plot a graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against m and use the gradient to find the value of d by multiply the gradient with the value of λ which be take a 589.3nm the experimental estimate of the value of d along with it uncertainty be use for the calculation in this experiment so that a more accurate value of the transition wavelength of the balmer series and 𝑅 ∞ could be calculate the value of d for the 78.8 line per mm diffraction grate which be calculate use the grate equation be found to be 1.27 ± 0.02 × 10 -5 m. graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against diffraction order m be plot to calculate the transition wavelength of the balmer series of hydrogen these be show in figure 4. the gradient of the graph for the plot of the red blue and violet spectral line and their respective wavelength be show in table 1. the wavelength of the balmer line be calculate use equation 13 by multiply the gradient with d. the value of d use be 1.27 ± 0.02 × 10 -5 m. 1. the value of the gradient of the graph the wavelength and their respective uncertainty the transition wavelength of the balmer series found be compare to the accepted value which be 656.28 nm 486.13 nm and 434.05 nm respectively 10 the accepted value lie within the range of value found the value of λ obtain for the balmer series be very accurate a they lie within one standard deviation of the accepted value the positive order fringe have strong intensity which result in the positive angle have a low uncertainty and high weight in the calculation of λ for the balmer line the number of negative and positive order take for each visible balmer line be five however some order be not visible such a m= -5 for red very few order be visible for balmer gamma which be see a a violet colour many of the violet fringe be dim and the position could not be determine accurately therefore the position of the fringe be take a approximation which result in a high uncertainty for the value of 𝜃. only two negative order fringe be visible for balmer gamma however the number of positive order slit which could be see be up to m 5. the size of the collimator slit be make to be quite large to increase the intensity of the fringe visible so they could be see clearly and to allow measurement of up to five positive and negative order to be take however this result in a large fringe width the fringe could no longer be approximate a slit due to the large fringe width and the position of the centre of the slit have to be approximate the light from the other experiment which be be conduct in the room might have also affected the value of 𝜃 calculate the uncertainty due to this be estimate and write a the uncertainty due to background light the sum of the uncertainty due to the fringe width background light spectrometer misalignment and lamp position be use a the total uncertainty for the value of 𝜃. the uncertainty of the vernier scale be not include a it be very small and be consider to be negligible the value of 𝑅 ∞ be calculate by plot where 𝑝 2. the negative gradient be the value of 𝑅 ∞ the gradient of the plot in figure 5 be -1.085 ± 0.041 × 10 7 m -1 the value of 𝑅 ∞ which be the negative gradient be found to be 1.09 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m -1 accurate to 3 s.f the error present in the experiment be list in table 2. table 2 show how each individual error affect the value of 𝑅 ∞ calculate the fringe width cause the high uncertainty in the calculation of the wavelength of the balmer line of hydrogen and 𝑅 ∞ therefore for future experiment the hydrogen lamp should be allow to cool for longer period of time between measurement so that the intensity of the visible fringe increase and the position of the fringe can be take more accurately a strong intensity hydrogen lamp should also be use so that the collimator slit size can be reduce and therefore the uncertainty due to the fringe width the experiment should also be conduct in a completely dark room to reduce the uncertainty due to the background light another suggestion for a more accurate measurement of 𝑅 ∞ would be to use a computer-aided diffraction grate spectrometer 1 the aim of the experiment be to measure the hydrogen balmer series and to calculate the value of the rydberg constant r∞ use a diffraction grate spectrometer three line of the balmer series balmer alpha beta and gamma be observe however the fourth line which have a wavelength of 410 nm could not be see 𝑅 ∞ be calculate by measure the transition wavelength of the hydrogen atomic spectrum by use the grate equation the value of 𝑅 ∞ be found to be 1.09 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m -1 accurate to 3 significant figure the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ which be 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 lie within the range of value the experiment be accurate in measure the value of 𝑅 ∞ a the value found in the experiment lie within one standard deviation of the accepted value the experiment be quite precise have a total uncertainty of 3.7 even though the total value include correction for the systematic error present these systematic error include the spectrometer misalignment the lamp position grate period fringe width and background light\"\n"," \"a hydrogen lamp be use to determine the rydberg constant which be have a commonly accepted value of 1.09678x10 7 m -1 .this be do use a grate spectrometer where the diffraction grate which be use have 78.8 line per millimetre the calibration of the spectrometer be do use a sodium lamp but a hydrogen lamp be use when collect data i calculate the rydberg constant to be 9.846x10 6 ± 5.14x10 -2 m -1 when an excite electron in an atom transition from a high energy level to a low energy level the change in energy be emit a a photon of specific wavelength which be give by e=hf 1 where h be planck 's constant f be the frequency of the photon and e be the energy of the photon a diffraction grate diffracts light when it pas through and the relationship between the wavelength λ distance between the slit d and the angle of diffraction θ be give by dsinθ=nλ when electron in hydrogen transition they wavelength be give by where -r ꚙ be the rydberg constant and n and p be the initial and final energy level respectively 1 when a hydrogen lamp be use three colour be visible -red purple and blue and these represent transition from n=3,4,5 to p=2 1 measurement of multiple order be take on both side of the zero order and this be use to find a wavelength for each colour use equation 2 before take any measurement use the grate spectrometer it first have to be align and focus this be do use a sodium lamp when a lamp be require we first ensure that there be no parallax between the image and cross hair by focus the eyepiece and camera lens then the telescope be align to the normal by first find the reflect image of the entrance slit after place the diffraction in the holder then the telescope be move by 45 degree and the angle be note a this be normal incidence and where the zero order should be finally the height of the image be adjust use the grate screw to ensure the image be at the right height for measurement and be not tilt which would affect the reading the setup can be see in figure 1 below figure 1 the figure above show the basic setup of the grate spectrometer where light come in from the source to the left the hydrogen lamp in this experiment the light pas through the collimator and then through the diffraction grate where it diffracts and the spectral line can be see through the telescope rotate the telescope clockwise show the negative order spectral line and the positive order line can be see by rotate the telescope anti-clockwise collimator telescope positive order after note down the zero order angle the hydrogen lamp be use to obtain the first set of reading we decide that reading on both side of the zero order would be take to reduce the uncertainty in the experiment one set of positive and negative order measurement for one colour would be take by me and then the lamp would be allow to cool the second set of reading for the same colour would be take by my partner after the lamp be consider cool enough for use this process be use to obtain measurement for all three colour this ensure that any systematic error or bias when reading the scale due to a single person reading the scale would not carry over in the analysis of the result and into the final conclusion if the hydrogen lamp be switch on for long period of time it produce very blurry line to prevent this from affect measurement the lamp be switch off periodically and allow to cool when take measurement of the different colour and their respective order the centre of these band be difficult to determine and can easily produce large uncertainty this meant that our method of determine the angle have to be change and so we chose to select the edge of the band closest to zero order and use this a our reference point for each colour and order the angle that be collect in the measurement for each order and colour be then subtract from the zero order angle for each respective measurement and this angle be θ for each different order which be then substitute into equation 2 where d be 1/78800 the diffraction grate have 78.8 line per mm so d be 1/lines per m this result in multiple wavelength for each colour red purple and blue so the average be take for each colour and this be the wavelength use to produce the final graph use equation 3 a graph of 1/wavelength be plot against 1/n 2 -1/p 2 and this be show in figure 2. the graph have a gradient of -9.846x10 6 ± 5.14x10 -2 and the intercept be 1.513x10 5 ± 1.583x10 -7 from this we can deduce the rydberg constant r ꚙ to be 9.846x10 6 m -1 this be different from the commonly accepted value of 1.09678x10 7 m -1 and it could be due to multiple reason one reason could be that the measurement of the angle be not perfect and that there be inaccurate reading due to human error another possible cause could be the wrong alignment and focus of the grate spectrometer which could result in reading that be far from accurate a final cause for the discrepancy could be that due to the slightly blur line in the purple spectral line the edge be not a definitive a it be for the other colour and this could likely affect our reading and the error could propagate when calculate the line of best fit the aim of this experiment be to find the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp this be do by allow the light from the hydrogen lamp to pa through a grate spectrometer and the spectral line be observe and the figure 2 the above graph show the correlation between wavelength and energy level transition the gradient of this graph represent the rydberg constant which be found to be -9.846x10 6 ± 5.14x10 -2 and the intercept be 1.513x10 5 ± 1.583x10 -7 angle measure so that a graph can be drawn and this can enable u to calculate the rydberg constant this experiment have many error which be not account for or prevent which produce some rather inaccurate result however our result calculate the rydberg constant to be 9.846x10 6 m -1\"\n"," \"this lab report go through the process and find of an experiment carry out to calculate the rydberg constant r∞ use a grate spectrometer our result give a value of 1.089×10 7 ±82490m −1 thus the true value 10,973,731.6 m −1 fall just outside the estimate margin of error the experimental process involves set up a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp in order to determine the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission spectrum in this experiment wavelength value for the red and blue spectral line be calculate each of these value be then combine with the knowledge of the balmer series and use in rydberg 's equation to get two separate value for r∞ one for each colour these value be then average to give the final value for r∞ t he rydberg constant r ∞ be a constant that appear in rydberg 's equation which predicts the wavelength of spectral light a a result of electron move between energy level in an atom when an element 's gaseous state be heat atom will absorb energy result in electron be excite and move from low energy state to high one when these electron de-excite back down to low energy level they release photon of specific energy correspond to the atom 's energy level because of this each element have a distinct spectral fingerprint this discovery form the basis of the study of spectroscopy this lab report describes an experiment which u a diffraction grate spectrometer to measure r ∞ the experiment first involves carefully set up the collimator grate and eyepiece so that the slit image be focus precisely at the cross wire inside the telescope once this be do the eyepiece be turn through various angle to look for spectral line the angle at which the spectral line occur be measure use a vernier scale built into the spectrometer table the angle and the order associate with each of the colour line be then record and compile to produce a dataset which can be graph in python a sin θ vs. order m for each colour the gradient of each graph be equal to λ d where d be the slit separation of the grate thus the value of λ can be obtain by multiply the value of the gradient by d. this value for λ be then substitute into rydberg 's equation to calculate r ∞ for that colour these value of r ∞ can then be average to obtain a final value for r ∞ the rydberg constant a mention in section i appear in rydberg 's equation which relates the wavelength of spectral line λ to the integer energy level of the initial and final energy state of the atom n and p respectively r ∞ be calculate by work out the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission spectrum and substitute the value into rydberg 's equation to understand how the emission spectrum for hydrogen be produce we must consider an important piece of apparatus for the experimentthe hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be essentially a long tube with two electrode on each end fill with hydrogen gas when a large potential difference be apply between the two electrode electron from the circuit be accelerate through the gas from one electrode to the other a the electron flow through the tube some of them may collide with atomic electron in the hydrogen gas 1 to understand the physic of what happens at this stage we can use the bohr model of the atom in the bohr model electron travel in circular orbit around the nucleus the energy of these orbit be proportional to the electron 's distance from the nucleus -the far the electron the high the energy most importantly the model state that the only stable orbit allow for the electron be those in which the electron 's angular momentum be an integer multiple h. thus electron can only orbit at discrete distance from the nucleus -orbits be quantize these quantize orbit be more commonly know a energy level and they be specific to each element 2 fig 1. the bohr model of the hydrogen atom show the electron tranisions represent the lymer blamer and paschen series now when an accelerate circuit electron with enough energy collides with the atomic electron in the energy level the atomic electron will absorb energy equal to that of the energy difference between two energy level this will excite the electron to that high energy level the excite electron will then de-excite back down to a low energy level and in the process emit a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the two energy level here be the key point -as each element have specific energy level only certain wavelength of light can be produce for each element more specifically only light of wavelength hc e where e be the energy difference between the two energy level will be emit from the lamp these specific frequency of light make up the emission spectrum for the element in the case of the hydrogen lamp the light emit from the lamp be only compose of frequency correspond to hydrogen 's emission spectrum however one of the key part of the experiment involves actually work out what the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission spectrum be in order to do this we need to use another key bit of apparatus -a diffraction grate use this we need to find a formula which relates the wavelength of the line to other feature of the apparatus such a the angle through which the telescope be turn this equation can be derive in the follow manner a diffraction grate can be thought of a a large number n of equally space narrow slit with slit separation d. for light of wavelength λ a principal maximum occurs when the phase difference between the two ray be an integer multiple m of 2π from fig 1. we can see that the path difference between two light ray be d sin θ thus where m be know a the order number thus if we gain a set in 1885 swiss physicist johann balmer deduce by trial and error that the wavelength of light spectrum emit by hydrogen atom follow the relationship where r be a constant which be now know a the rydberg constant r ∞ 3 however balmer suggest that this relationship could be generalise and it take swedish physicist johannes rydberg in 1889 to find the general formula now know a rydberg 's formula where n p for the hydrogen atom p 2 corresponds to the balmer series other series have also be calculate such a the ultraviolet lyman series for p 1 and the infrared paschen series for p 3 however these be less important for this experiment a none of these series produce visible emission line for the balmer hydrogen series there be 4 main emission line the red line h α corresponds to n 3 the turquoise/green line h β corresponds to n 4 the blue line h γ corresponds to n 5 and the purple/indigo line h δ corresponds to n 6 4 fig 3. the line spectrum for hydrogen depend on which colour line be see the appropriate value of n and p 2 should be use in rydberg 's equation this can then be combine with correspond value of λ to calculate r ∞ the setup for this experiment be imperative to it overall success and accuracy so we a take a lot of time to make sure the apparatus be prepared correctly fig 4. show the set up use for this experiment first we need to focus the telescope eyepiece and camera lens the telescope be turn such that it point at a pencil case roughly 5-10 metre away with an unobstructed view without the diffraction grate in place on the table the focus be do in two stage first the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire which be a `` × `` locate inside the telescope by slide the eyepiece in and out until the cross wire be a dark and sharp a possible next the actual camera lens be focus this involve adjust the focus knob on the side of the telescope until the distant pencil case be in sharp focus however just do this will not achieve the correct focus because parallax have n't be consider the way we eliminate parallax be by make use of the cross wire we look through the telescope so we could see both the focus image of the cross wire and the other spectrometer by move our head left and right we saw that the cross wire and the spectrometer move back and forth in sync i.e one do n't move faster than the other this told u that the whole telescope be fully focus and that there be no parallax between the image and the cross wire now that the telescope be fully focus the focus knob on the telescope be not move for the remainder of the experiment after this we need to focus the collimator first the telescope be roughly align with the collimator at this point in a usual spectrometry experiment the light would be turn off an the focus would be test use a hydrogen lamp source however the manufacturer of the lamp recommend that the hydrogen lamp should be switch of every 30 second to prevent the lamp overheat see a the focus of the collimator take considerably longer than 30 second just for this part of the experiment a sodium lamp be use in it place the advantage of use a sodium lamp be that it could be kept switch on all the time the lamp be place close behind the collimator and without change the focus on the camera lens the focus knob on the collimator be adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire a with the previous part the next part of the setup involve align the diffraction grate with the collimator such that the grate be normal to the collimator first we use the previous setup in which the telescope and collimator be align and the telescope be focus on the sodium lamp we then lock the spectrometer table so the table ca n't move and take an angle reading use the verier angle scale due to the fact that the vernier scale on the spectrometer be very small we use a magnify glass to read all our measurement this particular magnify glass use have a bonus feature of double a a torch which make it possible to see the scale in the dark the measurement take be 221 • 38 next we subtract 90 • from this value and move the telescope to that exact value of 131 • 38 then we lock the telescope in place and unlocked the table so that the grate be free to rotate independently of the telescope and collimator afterwards the table be turn until the slit image be see through the telescope which indicate that the grate be roughly at 45 • to both the telescope and collimator to get the image exactly focus on the cross wire we make use of the slow motion drive a knob that move the table very slowly and precisely to make very small adjustment so that the image fell exactly on the cross wire once this be achieve we take a reading at this point of 80 • and add the 45 • back that that the grate be at an angle of 125 • now that grate be normal to the collimator the table be lock and not change for the remainder of the experiment the sodium lamp be then replace with the hydrogen lamp and the remainder of the experiment could begin we start by try to identify colour we saw in the emission spectrum have already study the emission spectrum for hydrogen we knew that there be 4 possible colour red turquoise blue and purple for this experiment the most visible and abundant colour be red and blue we in fact do n't see any turquoise or purple line at all to start with we focus the cross wire on the central maximum or 0th order line which be measure to be at 125 • then start with the red emission line we turn the telescope to the right until our cross wire focus on it 's first red line use the vernier scale we then record the angle measurement use the magnify glass for that line and name it the 1st order maximum m=1 the angle measurement data be then add to a table of order m and angle on the vernier scale θ next we continued to move the telescope to the right until we saw the next red line m 2 and again take the angle reading and add it to the table we continued this process by turn the telescope to the right until we could see no more we then turn the telescope back to the central maximum and repeat this process for by move the telescope to the left in this case we simply call the first line we saw m -1 and the second line m -2 and so on with negative integer this process be then repeat for the blue line and a set of data be obtain relate the scale reading on the vernier scale to the order of the maximum for both the red and blue spectrum line in order to work out lambda for both the red and blue line we need to make two graph of sinθ v m. however the θ in this case be should not be the reading on the vernier scale but should be the angle of the spectral line relative to the central line thus for each reading of θ on the scale we have to take away 125 • to obtain the correct set of value θ co then we could work out sinθ co and plot this against the order number m. one option would be to plot this data by hand however a the range of angle gain be small roughly 20 • for each colour and because we take the measurement to 4 decimal place we decide to plot the graph on python use the sp.polyfit function we have 3 main advantage over draw by hand the function ensures that we can draw a perfect least square line regression line it allows u to perfectly work out the gradient of this line again something we would add error into when find dy and dx and it also automatically work out error bar and gradient value this would prove extremely useful when do uncertainty calculation once the data have be compile and the graph be draw on python we could read off the gradient value for each of the two colour each of the gradient value be then multiply by the slit separation d. the number of line per unit length state on the diffraction grate be 80 slit per millimetre however the diffraction grate in fact u an old definition in imperial unit of 2001 line per inch this can therefore be approximate a 78.8 line per millimetre thus the slit separation d 1.269 × 10 −5 for each colour we then use the appropriate value of n and p from the balmer series the balmer series state that the red line come from transition of electron from the 3rd to the 2nd energy level -thus n 3 for red spectral line by the same reason n 5 for blue spectral line by definition the balmer series be for when p 2 thus p 2 for both colour finally the value of n p and λ be plug into the rydberg equation and a value of r ∞ be obtain for each colour both value be then average to get a final value for r ∞ the final result obtain forr ∞ from this experiment be 1.089 × 10 7 ± 82490m −1 therefore the standard accepted value of 10,973,731.6m −1 lie just outside the margin of error a table of the data represent the result for the red emission line angle be show in table i and the result for the blue emission line angle be show in table ii table iii show all final result that have be derive use the method discus in section iv θ co represent the correct angle explain in section iv graph of both these set of data be show in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the error calculate in table iii be easy to calculate and merely involve use the standard error combine rule however the procedure in calculate the initial error begin when align the diffraction grate when the telescope be first align with collimator with the cross wire focus on the central image an angle reading of 221 • 38 be take however there be an error of ±0.5 on this reading due to this be half of the small measurable interval on the scale thus when the telescope be then turn through 90 • the new angle which the telescope be at be 131 • 38 ±0.5 next the diffraction grate be focus exactly at 45 • to both the telescope and the collimator again by make use of the cross wire then an angle reading of 80 • be take use the vernier scale again once more this reading include an error of ±0.5 thus when the diffraction grate be turn back there be yet again the same error for the same reason therefore the diffraction grate be normal to the collimator with an error of ±1 this mean that the error for any singular reading be ±1.5 a it include the add error of the grate calibration but also the ±0.5 error of any reading take at an angle θ co to the central fringe the uncertainty in λ be directly calculate in python by use the function matplotlib and scipy we be able to directly read off the uncertainty for both wavelength σ λr 2.42nm for the red line and σ λb 6.66nm for the blue line for each colour an associate rydberg constant value could be obtained.the error be calculate in the form k λ 2 × σ λ where k be equal to λ be the wavelength of the colour and σ λ be the uncertainty in λ. finally the two value of r ∞ be average and the uncertainty be add in quadrature and halve to obtain the uncertainty in r ∞ give above in this report we present the result of an experiment to determine rydberg 's constant r ∞ by study the spectral line of hydrogen the data be finally compile to determine the value of r ∞ a 1.089 × 10 7 ± 82490m −1 unfortunately the true value of 10,973,731.6 m −1 be just outside the error of margin for this result suggest that the experiment could have be improve one aspect that could have improve the overall accuracy be carry out the same procedure for the aqua and purple spectral line however we be not able to clearly identify line from these colour this may have be due to the fact that the hydrogen lamp be kept on for too long if this experiment be to be carry out again we would make sure that the lamp be turn off every 30 second to allow the lamp to remain cool another possibility it that the error of ±1.5 for the angle reading be indeed too low due to the small size of the vernier scale and the of take reading use a large magnify glass in the dark it be possible that the error on the angle be more on the order of ±5\"\n"," \"in this experiment we use a grate spectrometer to obtain data on the visible emission spectrum of hydrogen to deduce the rydberg constant this require the balmer transition wavelength of the different frequency of light in the emission spectrum which be obtain use the grate equation from each value obtain from the different frequency of light in the spectrum we obtain a mean experimental value of 11080000 ± 30000 m −1 to 4 sf we far proceed to quantify the source of error and identify the systematic error result in the 0.97 difference from the true value error analysis give u a revise value of 10960000 ± 40000. t his experiment relies on spectroscopy -a powerful `` noninvasive `` technique a spectrometer be an instrument which be use to study the spectrum of light from a source -light from the emission spectrum of a hydrogen atom in this case a spectrometer produce a collimate beam of light use a lens or a mirror disperse it with a grate which be then focus and view with an eyepiece a hydrogen lamp be use to electrically excite hydrogen atom to produce a spectrum the spectrometer be then use to measure the angular position of each order maximum relative to the central maximum fiducial three repeat be carry out to obtain a large set of measurement on do so the grate equation be use to plot a graph whose gradient be use to obtain the wavelength of light for each order maximum the balmer series for hydrogen be then use to obtain the rydberg constant for each colour of maximum obtain the setup of the experiment accommodates many source of systematic error which will be recognise and account for in this report to produce a revise value for the rydberg constant the grate use to diffract the light emit by the excite hydrogen atom consists of a large number of very narrow slit each slit be separate by a distance d. a principal maximum for light of wavelength λ occurs when an integer multiple m of 2π be the phase difference between neighbour ray of light a can be see from figure 1 the path difference equal d sin θ. hence fig 1 this figure be a schematic representation of a spectrometer the collimate lens make the light from the source passing through the narrow slit parallel this light travel perpendicular to the grate which be diffract and focus onto the cross-hair by the camera a camera allows for a magnify image to be view through the eyepiece the inset show the path difference d sin θ. cite from 1 and therefore where m be the order number of the maximum a an example for n 4 slit the fringe pattern show in figure 2 occurs when n slit be illuminate the first minimum occurs at a phase angle the resolve power of the spectrometer be essential a we can identify the minimum difference in wavelength such that two spectral line can be distinguish clearly we can find this by consider the fact that minimum in a certain diffraction fig 2 the diffraction pattern see when n 4 show the principal minimum and maximum cite from 1 pattern occur at the same position a the maximum in a different pattern this can be see in figure 3 where light have a second wavelength λ 2 λ − ∆λ produce it m th principal maximum at a slightly different angle θ 2 where d sin θ 2 mλ 2 a minimum will occur at angle θ if by substitute for d sin θ use equation 5 and 6 the difference in wavelength ∆λ λ−λ 2 where ∆λ λ. consequently where λ ∆λ be the resolve power r. this mean that the small difference in wavelength ∆λ which can be distinguish at a wavelength λ can be found halfway between two equal spectral line the intensity be approximately 20 less than the peak equation 8 represent the separation at which this occurs and thus the two line be distinguishable from each other in this experiment we use a 300 line per mm grate which mean n be large and hence ∆λ be small which mean the spectrometer can resolve spectral line to a very small difference in wavelength the rydberg formula for the transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by where r ∞ be the rydberg constant and n and p be integer represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the hydrogen atom respectively the accurately measure value of the rydberg constant r ∞ be 10973731.6 m −1 r ∞ can be express in term of fundamental constant a where α be the fine structure constant m e the mass of the electron c the speed of light and h planck 's constant α can be express a where h be the reduce planck constant e be the charge of an electron and 0 the permittivity of free space note that α be dimensionless where 1/α ∼ 134.036. the balmer series be the series of spectral line emit by an excite hydrogen atom in the visible spectrum and be give by equation 9 with the value of p 2 and n 3 4 5 .. this be for the atom drop from the n th energy level to the second i.e p 2 energy level figure 4 show this for n 3 4 with p 2. this cause a photon of frequency in the visible spectrum to be give off by use a colour chart and equation 9 it be possible to calculate the expect value of λ and identify the colour of light expect to be observe in the spectrum reference 1 and 2 be use to explain the theory the spectrometer need careful adjustment and set up before it could be use a schematic representation of the spectrometer be show in figure 1. we adjust the eyepiece by observe the emission spectrum of sodium atom use a sodium lamp such that the image be at a convenient view distance we use a sodium lamp for adjustment instead of a hydrogen lamp because leave the hydrogen lamp for too long cause weak transition from molecular hydrogen to be observe but most importantly the hydrogen line grow weaker and dimmer in time and become difficult to observe the camera lens be focus by bring a distant object into focus -in our case we focus on a lamp-post on the street we do this so that there be no parallax between the cross hair and the image the telescope be then align with the axis of the collimator the sodium lamp be place close to the slit and the focus of the collimator be adjust to produce a sharp image of the slit at the cross hair we set the cross hair to an `` x `` rather than a `` `` a this make it easy to focus it centre on the centre of a maximum thereby achieve a more accurate measurement of the angular displacement it be very important to understand what each clamp screw and slow motion drive do a turn the wrong one could disrupt the whole setup the rotate telescope scale read from 0 − 360 • the scale be read relative to a zero fiducial reading on the vernier scale which be fix to the rotate table base the vernier scale read in arcminute or sixtieth of a degree the telescope be then move through precisely 90 • and clamped into position a mirror be put into the grate holder and the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit be see in the eyepiece do this ensures that the incident beam from the collimator be 45 • to the mirror surface this be confirm by now replace the mirror with the 300 line per mm grate many orange sodium spectral line be observe but line the median line with the crosshair ensures that the grate surface be 45 • to the beam the grate surface be fragile and hence great care be take not to touch it the screw under the grate table be use to set the height of the slit image the aperture be decrease to obtain a solid vertical spectral line the grate drive be use to set the grate such that the slit image be precisely at the cross hair note the reading on both the scale a an initial reading the grate be then rotate precisely through 45 • this ensures the grate be accurately set and the beam be normal to it surface the spectral line be observe through the telescope and be note to be above the plane define by the cross hair this occur because the grate ruling be not parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope to correct this a diffract image of the slit at a large angle of diffraction be observe the appropriate grate adjustment screw be use to rotate the grate in the plane of it surface to low the image it be essential to only rotate the grate in the plane of it surface to ensure that the incident beam be still normal to it surface we could now proceed with the experiment to use the spectrometer to make accurate repeatable measurement the sodium lamp be now replace with the hydrogen lamp the main scale reading combine with the vernier scale reading give the total angle the vernier scale reading be obtain by observe which vernier ruling line up with a ruling on the fix scale the angular displacement of the central pink maximum relative to the 0 • mark be record this be the fiducial relative to which θ for each order maximum m be measure both positive and negative order maximum be observe and three repeat be obtain on have collect the data a python program be write which plot sin θ against order m. accord to equation 3 the gradient of the line of best fit obtain equal λ d therefore where d 10 −3 /300 this give λ for each of the 3 colour -blue cyan and red observe in the spectrum also know a h-γ h-β and h-α respectively the value obtain be show in table i to 4 significant figure a this be the accuracy of θ measure by the spectrometer blue/h-γ 430.0 ± 1.8 nm cyan/h-β 483.2 ± 2.1 nm red/h-α 646.9 ± 4.7 nm table i wavelength of the three observe spectral colour consequently equation 9 can be use to obtain r ∞ from each value of wavelength a the value for the rydberg constant obtain from different colour be show in table ii the mean experimental value for r ∞ and it uncertainty be calculate to be r ∞ 11 080 000 ± 30 000 m −1 14 a see in figure 6 the relationship between order m and sin θ for all three value of λ follow a linear relationship this result agrees with what be predict by equation 3 however the balmer series include other prominent line a see in figure 5 -several close to ultravoilet and hence not clearly visible but one in the visible spectrum with λ 410 nm which be not see this may mean that the hydrogen atom be not excite enough to produce this line or that it be too dark to be see perhaps a well lamp and a darker room would allow for this spectral line to be observe the value for λ obtain from each gradient yield a minimal uncertainty a be see in table i -the large percentage uncertainty be 0.72 for red light d have negligible uncertainty which implies that the uncertainty in the value of λ be only dependent on the uncertainty in the gradient of the line of best fit from equation 12 the uncertainty in the gradient be dependent on the consistency and accuracy of our measurement for θ. a the spectrometer be a very accurate instrument capable of a precision of under three part in ten thousand 1 the error do not originate from the limitation of the setup but be systematic far n and p be constant and hence the systematic error in r ∞ originates from that in λ. our value for r ∞ a give in equation 14 differ by 0.97 from the true value far an error of 0.31 on the mean be very small and do not include the true value this suggests the presence of a small systematic error there be several potential source of systematic error parallax be the major source of systematic error a we have to use a magnify glass to identify the position where the vernier ruling coincide with the fix scale ruling from various view angle the ruling be very close to each other the process even more difficult we estimate the error in θ due to this difficulty a 2 arcminute and parallax a 1 arcminute to the vernier reading -a total error of 3 arcminute these error be include in the previous calculation but i believe parallax would have add an error of 0.2 • to our central maximum fiducial reading if this be account for the modify python code produce the revise value of r ∞ r ∞ 10 960 000 ± 40 000 m −1 15 a can be see in equation 15 the revise r ∞ and it error include the true value it now differs from the true value by 0.1 the zero error on the scale be non existent however a the experiment be perform on two separate day this meant that we have to use the instrument a be set-up by the group precede u there may have be a change in the spectrometer use thus ever so slightly affect measurement even though we re-configured the entire instrument additionally we have to re-configure the spectrometer a the wrong clamp screw be turn which meant that the scale be not fix and our setup be disrupt when the telescope be move this may have cause the telescope to be slightly mis-aligned with the collimator while measure θ the table that the spectrometer sits on would move slightly which would be re-adjusted this would slightly affect lamp position even though we have marked the fix position of the lamp relative to the table this could potentially add some error far not focus the cross-hair on the exact centre of the spectral line may have also cause a very slight error in θ in the order of less than 1 arcminute -negligible background light from the computer and lamp be use by the other group perform the experiment would sometimes be see through the telescope which make focus the cross-hair difficultperhaps add an error in the order of less than 1 arcminute a well although negligible if all these source of systematic error be account for by re-visiting the experiment and quantify the error a with parallax the value for r ∞ achieve would be even closer to the true value reduce the percentage difference to small than even 0.1 while reduce the error on it v. conclusion in this report we aim to calculate the rydberg constant by use a spectrometer we measure the angular displacement of each order maximum the grate equation be use to calculate the wavelength of the spectral line observe eventually the balmer series for hydrogen be use to obtain a value for the rydberg constant our initial value r ∞ 11080000 ± 30000 m −1 differ by 0.97 from the true value after accounting for the source of systematic error in the experiment with the major source be parallax the revise value r ∞ 10960000 ± 40000 m −1 differ only by 0.1 and include the true value within the error far source of error which would decrease the percentage difference even more be also suggest this indicates that the experiment be a success in obtain an accurate value for r ∞ to improve the experiment far we would complete the entire experiment in one day instead -thus eliminate the effect of a change of set-up furthermore take additional repeat would only reduce the error on the value this experiment highlight the need for error analysis and how to account for systematic error the experience gain in python error propagation will be useful for future experiment\"\n"," \"this paper discus the method use to outline an experiment to determine a value for rydberg 's constant use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer to determine the wavelength of the various spectral line we take data for the two most visible spectral line red and blue and calculate a value for rydberg 's constant from both we obtain a final value of 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 despite the experimental method we use have low systematic and random error due to the high resolution of the grate spectrometer use we believe the final result 's error be mainly due to the fact that only the red and blue spectral line be use this be because they be the only two spectral line we could take accurate and precise data for he rydberg constant be an important constant link the wavelength of several element spectrum with their atomic structure and be originally introduce by johannes robert rydberg 1854-1919 when he publish his find in 1890 on the emission spectrum of certain element 1 originally of empirical nature the rydberg constant be use in an equation that attempt to find some sort of order in the line of emission spectrum of the element when precise measurement of the wavelength of the emission spectrum of the element be carry out it soon become clear that some of the line fell into pattern the line would start out initially space out and start to crowd together these pattern be call 'spectral series and a the different line in the series can be label n n+1 n+2 and so forth the correspond wavelength label a 𝜆n physicist begin to explore and try and find the mathematical relationship between 𝜆n and n. rydberg analytically found a solution the problem with the equation 𝑛 𝑁 0 where n be the wavenumber 1/𝜆 where 𝜆 be the wavelength n0 be rydberg 's constant first calculate to be 109721.6cm -1 and m and p be integer that be specific to the member of the series 1 rydberg found that his equation fit the balmer series the spectral series for the emission spectrum of hydrogen use p 2 and m ≥ 3. this equation provide an accurate representation for many spectral series of different element but be conceive purely through observation and calculation the scientific theory to support it come more than 20 year later when bohr use the idea that the frequency of the photon emit by an atom be directly proportional to the difference in energy state which give m and p meaning the initial and final energy state 2 the rydberg constant could now be express a where r be the rydberg constant with an accepted measure value of 10973731.6m -1 me the mass of the electron c the speed of light h plank 's constant and 𝛼 the fine structure constant which can be far express by the follow equation where e be the charge of an electron 𝜖0 be the permittivity of free space and h be the reduce planck constant in our experiment we observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen with a grate spectrometer in order to find a value for rydberg 's constant a grate spectrometer be necessary so we could take multiple reading and measure the wavelength of different member of the balmer series although due to experimental condition only the first two red and blue be clearly visible enough to take consistent record the diffraction grate be simply a large number n of narrow slit all an equal d away from each other 3 the path difference between neighbour ray from a diffraction grate be 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 and so where m be the order number of the diffraction pattern this show that a d and 𝜆 be constant 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 and the order number should be directly proportional we use this fact by measure the angle at successive order number and graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against the order number to yield a straight line with gradient equal to 𝜆/d in this experiment we use a diffraction grate with 78.8 line per millimeter which mean d be 0.127mm use the grate spectrometer a show in fig 1 require setup and calibration of the three section of the equipment firstly we have to adjust the camera so it would be in focus with collimate light we do this by point determine rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp t the camera at an object on the other side of the laboratory room about 30m away a the object be sufficiently far enough away that the light ray come from it will be collimate themselves now that the camera be calibrate for collimate light we adjust the collimator by rotate the camera back in line with the collimator and use a sodium lamp we use sodium lamp a a substitute for hydrogen lamp a they do not heat up a easily and we would have to turn off the hydrogen lamp every few minute which would disrupt the calibration we adjust the focus ring on the collimator until the slit through which the light be come through be in focus with the diffraction grate now in place we now align the camera with the grate in order to align them we use the vernier scale which could measure the angle at a resolution of 1 arcminute all angle measurement have a very small uncertainty of ±1 arcminute a we have a magnify glass and take careful measurement each time finally we adjust the orientation of the grate by adjust the screw on the platform that held it this be key a it ensures that the distance between adjacent slit be d a if it have be rotate the distance would actually be dcosθ where θ be the angle between the horizontal plane and the bottom of the grate we ensure that the angle be minimize by use the camera and diffraction grate themselves by rotate and slowly sweep the camera through the various order we observe the spectral line gradually get high due to the grate 's orientation we adjust the orientation to minimize this effect and stop when the effect be not noticeable the grate spectrometer be now ready to be use we swap the sodium lamp for a hydrogen lamp and adjust the slit width on the collimator to find a balance between allow enough light through to be able to see the spectral line of high order but not too much that the line would be out of focus we begin measure the angle of the camera whenever the crosshair align with a spectral line for successive order number we decide to adjust the orientation of the crosshair so that the line be at a 45° angle this make it considerably easy to estimate the position of a spectral line we believe this be due to the four line act a a reference to compare the position of the spectral line to whereas if the crosshair be rotate vertically so the orientation have that of a '+ sign the horizontal line do not help u at all in closing down on a spectral line we measure and record once again with a resolution of 1 arcminute the angle for ±3 order include the zeroth order of the diffraction pattern of the blue and red spectral line in order to determine their wavelength although there be other colour present they be too faint to get consistent reliable result with a large enough range the result for the angle of the various order of the red and blue spectral line be show in table 1 the result show a clear trend of a roughly 3° interval between red order and a roughly 2° interval between blue order this be consistent with what we expect a red light have a large wavelength than blue light from equation 4 we can see that sinθ be proportional to the wavelength of the light and with a range roughly twenty to thirty degree we know that θ will be roughly proportional with sinθ θ will increase with sinθ we plot a scatterplot of our result of sinθ against the order and calculate the line of best fit by use the scipy polyfit function weight the point all equally a we saw no anomaly and plot the line use the scipy poly1d function the line of best fit be show in fig 2 the different gradient clearly show the different wavelength for red and blue light note that sinθ do not equal 0 at the zeroth order a we decide to keep the start angle consistent with our result and not make everything relative to a zeroth order of 0° fig 3 show our result relative to 0° at the zeroth order to show the result from the grate spectrometer where 'red angle and 'blue angle be the angle for the red spectral line and blue spectral line respectively we originally record the result start at order 0 and work our way into the positive order first we checked the zeroth order again to have the same reference point for the negative order but do not record a mean average a they be the same for both the red and blue spectral line the result show a clear trend of a roughly 3 interval between red order and a roughly 2 interval between blue order a grate spectrometer fig 1 a diagram to show the grate spectrometer that we use in the experiment divide into three main part the collimator the prism table that house the grate and the telescope or camera that contain the eyepiece for u to observe the spectral line through 4 the most noticeable difference would be that the line of best fit now have a positive gradient and they both cross exactly at the zeroth order which be not the case before there be a 7 arcminute difference between the two a our final result for calculate rydberg 's constant be dependent on the gradient of the straight line the fact that they perfectly cross be not important and it be merely a translation of the two line however change the start point so that the angle be 0° at the zeroth order be important a the different value of sinθ will be different at this range most notably there be value of sinθ which be positive but a the sin curve do not have a constant gradient different start point will yield different gradient for our line of best fit this be key a it will affect our final value when calculate rydberg 's constant and so we decide to stay true to our result use equation 4 a the equation of our line of best fit we use 𝜆/d be the gradient of the two straight line we calculate the wavelength of the two spectral line to be 6.16 × 10 −7 𝑚 ± 0.10 × 10 −7 𝑚 ±1.62 for red light and 4.41 × 10 −7 𝑚 ± 0.09 × 10 −7 𝑚 ±2.04 for blue light we calculate the error in the gradient of the straight line use the covariant matrix generate from the sp.polyfit function we then calculate the rydberg constant use equation 1 and use p a 2 and m a 3 and 4 for red and blue light respectively we calculate the rydberg constant to be 10733268.1292m -1 use the red wavelength and 11106867.2335m -1 use the blue wavelength we found that the mean average for the rydberg constant be 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 despite measure the angle for the diffract spectral line to a high degree of accuracy and precision use the vernier scale with a resolution of 1 arcminute we believe that the fact that we only manage to use two spectral line red and blue meant that ultimately our final result have a high standard deviation and therefore error have we be able to see other spectral line and record data for them we would have be able to greatly reduce our standard deviation in our final result overall throughout the experiment we believe we kept the experimental error low due to our careful experimental technique however we be not able to take multiple repeat due to time constraint which could have help to reduce random error and increase the accuracy of our final result but not by much a we encounter no anomaly and all of the data point be within the straight best fit line we have calculate the error bar use the bad case scenario of ±0.5° on all of our angle a the exact position of the spectral line of high order be harder to discern have only seven data point be not ideal either a this increase the uncertainty and error of the gradient of the straight line although increase the number of data point would prove difficult due to the fact that any order above three become increasingly difficult to make out and this would then increase the overall uncertainty for each value of the angle the aim of this experiment be to determine the value for rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer with a 78.8 line/mm grate and a hydrogen lamp use a hydrogen lamp allow u to calculate rydberg 's constant use the balmer series by measure the angle for the various order of red and blue spectral line we obtain a final experimental value for the rydberg constant of 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 and decide the large source of error be due to the fact that we only use two different spectral line which give a high standard deviation for our final result we believe this error could be reduce by change the light condition such that the other spectral line can be see and attempt to take data for high order of the diffract line graph of result fig 2 a scatterplot and straight line of best fit for both the red and blue spectral line although there be no anomaly the 0 order for the red and blue spectral line do differ slightly but be within each other give the error bar graph of result with 0 at order zero fig 3 the same result yield a slightly different scatterplot and line of best fit note that this time both line cross exactly at the origin a they have be make to do so\"\n","

after the swedish physicist johannes rydberg who do work on the hydrogen spectrum 1 the rydberg constant be very significant in atomic physic owe to it connection to the fundamental physical constant m c e h and ε 0 these constant be define in section ii.ii a diffraction grate be a flat sheet of glass or metal rule with straight slit with equal distance between them the diffraction grate of the grate spectrometer have slit which be n -1 m apart where n be the number of slit per metre when two ray emerge from the slit interfere then there be a maximum i.e constructive interference when their phase difference be 2πn where n 1 2 3 … where be the wavelength of the light through the diffraction grate the path difference be s n θ hence where n be the order number of the maximum in the interference pattern n 1 be for the two maximum on either side closest to the principal maximum n 2 be for the two second-closest maximum and so on θ be the angular displacement of the order maximum from the principal maximum and d n -1 of the diffraction grate therefore the final formula be by rearrange equation 1 the formula be equation 2 show that if d be know and θ and n be determine experimentally use the grate spectrometer then a graph of s n θ on the y-axis and n on the x-axis can be plot the gradient of this graph multiply by d would give the wavelength of the monochromatic light 2 ii.ii the rydberg equation and emission spectrum the rydberg equation `` be a theoretical prediction of the wavelength found in the emission line spectrum of hydrogen atom `` 1 these wavelength be give by the formula where be the wavelength of the photon emit from the electron transition or absorbed if the electron start out at the low energy level instead of the high onefor an absorption spectrum r be the rydberg constant and n and p be the principal quantum number of the initial and final energy level of the electron respectively for an emission line spectrum the principal quantum number be the number give to each orbit the small orbit have principal quantum number 1 the next orbit have number 2 and so on in ascend order of size see fig 1 3 figure 1 electron orbit with the principal quantum number and the balmer electron transition 4 the rydberg constant r ∞ can be express by the physical fundamental constant where m be the mass of the electron e be the charge of the electron ε 0 be the permittivity of free space h be planck 's constant a c be the speed of light in a vacuum 1 if p 2 and n be set to the integer from 3 to 7 in equation 3 then the subsequent wavelength calculate make up the balmer series of the spectral line for atomic hydrogen see fig 1 which represent all the electron transition down to orbit 2. the calculate wavelength be part of the visible spectrum and one spectral line wavelength be in the ultraviolet region 1 iii the experimental method in order to measure the angular displacement of spectral line from a hydrogen lamp at the first the grate spectrometer need to be set up and calibrate see fig 2 for final grate spectrometer setup for the setup instead of use a hydrogen lamp a sodium lamp be use because a hydrogen lamp get hot fairly quickly so it be n't suitable for setup because set up the spectrometer take about an hour and fifteen minute 2 at first the eyepiece be focus on the crosswire and then the camera lens be focus such that a distant object be focus on the cross wire for the second part the distant object be a tree the grate spectrometer be take to be point out of the window 2 afterwards the telescope be turn to be align with the axis of the collimator the collimator focus be adjust to get a sharp image of the crosswire 2 then the telescope be move through 90° and a diffraction grate d 1/ 3x10 5 m be place in the holder then the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the entrance slit be see this align with the cross hair such that the image through the eyepiece be a cross shape with a vertical orange line through the middle which be the spectral emission line of the sodium vapour this indicate that the grate surface be at 45° to the axis of the collimator then the telescope be turn through 90° again so that it be in line with the axis of the collimator and the diffraction grate be turn so that it surface be normal to the axis 2 figure 2 the final setup of the grate spectrometer the problem encounter here be that the spectral line have a thickness also some difficulty be encounter when adjust the telescope position so the cross hair intersection would be in the middle of it thus this be a source of error however my lab partner and i decide that the thickness of the line be n't thick enough for the error to not be negligible the spectral line have a thickness because energy level be n't infinitely sharp due to hyperfine splittingthe zeeman effect splitting of spectral line due to a b-field there be magnetic object around the apparatus in the room such a metal paperclip and other apparatus with magnetic metal component but their effect be very subtle a hyperfine splitting be n't observe in addition the negligible error be justified also because the temperature in the room be quite standard and do n't affect the hydrogen gas to the extent that we could n't ignore it so thermal doppler broadening do n't affect our subsequent measurement either 2 5 after the setup we interpret the spectral line in the eyepiece to be the central maximum of the diffraction pattern because the telescope be align with the axis of the collimator ideally the central maximum should have zero angular displacement from the axis of the collimator and the slit image in the eyepiece be the closest to the central maximum with almost zero angular displacement from the central maximum 2 iii.ii determine the rydberg constant after set up the spectrometer to take accurate measurement of angular displacement of spectral emission line the sodium lamp be replace with the hydrogen lamp during the course of the experiment although we be told that the lamp should be turn off every 10 minute for about 15-20 minute it be kept on for the entirety of the experiment a it be advise that instead the lamp should be turn off when the spectral line start flicker which do n't happen when align with the principal axis of the collimator the scale on the spectrometer read 80.40 ± 0.05° and this angle be decide to be the reference angle for the n th order maximum 0.05° 3 minute of arc be decide to be the absolute uncertainty for each angle measurement for the follow reason \\uf0b7 decide where the measurement mark line up be quite difficult because the scale be small and while try to read it \\uf0b7 i be in an awkward position because the other component of the spectrometer get in my way \\uf0b7 we decide that get the measurement wrong by more than 3 minute of arc be highly unlikely \\uf0b7 the room be dark and a magnify glass with a light be require to be use to read the scale and even then the scale be difficult to read \\uf0b7 parallax error be not likely because the scale be very close together and it be test that my position when reading the scale do n't affect it o it be test by me reading the 80.4° reading from different position and a far a i could tell the measurement do n't change when look through the eyepiece the observation be that there be 3 different colour and hence 3 different wavelength of light these be red pinkish light blue almost turquoise and violet almost purple the order from the central maximum be that red be first and then light blue and then violet on both side of the central maximum we be expect to see four line because accord to the balmer series and the rydberg equation see section ii.ii we therefore believe that the 4 th spectral line be too close to the ultraviolet region for u to see or just in that region equation 1 be for monochromatic light and there be 3 different wavelength show so the result for n and θ be collect separately for each colour and 3 different table and graph be plot for each colour in order to take measurement for each wavelength the telescope start out at the central maximum and then be turn until the cross hair intersection align with the middle of the nth order spectral line this be do on both side of the principal maximum and go up to n 3. it could n't go far because the intensity become too low especially for the violet wavelength where we could n't take measurement for n 3 on both side due to that reason in addition the spectrometer be set up next to a wall so the telescope be n't able to go far on one side of the principal maximum only because the wall be block it apart from the uncertainty in the angular displacement of the maximum there be n't any other uncertainty for any other quantity in equation 1. from the 3 graph the gradient multiply by d give 3 different wavelength the long for red and the shortest for violet these result be then use in equation 3 with n 3 for red n 4 for light blue and n 5 for violet for the red and light blue wavelength 6 reading of θ be take in total go up to n 3 for each side for the violet wavelength only 4 reading be take up to n 2. hence the uncertainty in r ∞ calculate from violet light be expect to be large than the other two graph 1 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for red light the graph for red light see graph 1 be compute by python to have the equation 5 the gradient of the graph be multiply by d to give the wavelength of the red light which turn out to be 659.33 ± 7.03 nm see equation 2 graph 2 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for light blue light in the same way for light blue light see graph 2 the equation of the graph be 6 hence by use the same method a for the red light see equation 2 the wavelength of the light blue spectral line be determine to be 491.33 ± 6.20 nm graph 3 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for violet light for violet light python compute the equation of the graph to be 7 the result wavelength be 433.66 ± 13.40 nm the absolute uncertainty for violet light be great than the uncertainty for red and light blue light a expect because it have two less reading in addition the error bar be show to be visibly large for violet light a show by compare graph 1 2 and 3. the error on the wavelength σ be calculate use the follow method where σ be the absolute uncertainty in the gradient compute by python use σ θ 3 minute of arc use these wavelength and equation 3 the rydberg constant determine from each wavelength be the follow \\uf0b7 for red light r ∞ 10 920 176.54 ± 116 545.04 m -1 the uncertainty here be 1.07 \\uf0b7 for light blue light r ∞ 10 854 890.47 ± 136 975.80 m -1 the uncertainty here be 1.26 \\uf0b7 for violet light r ∞ 10 988 733.21 ± 339 386.68 m -1 the uncertainty here be 3.09 about 3 time the uncertainty for blue and red which be expect a mention before therefore the final value of the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10 921 266.74 ± 197 635.84 m -1 the result uncertainty be calculate to be 1.81 use equation 4 the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10 980 368.06 m -1 and this theoretical result be within the experimental result 's range the difference between the theoretical and the experimental value be determine to be 0.54 to summarise in this experiment i set up a grate spectrometer in order to take accurate measurement of the angular displacement of n th order maximum from the 0 th order maximum i do this for 3 different wavelength which be 3 spectral line correspond to 3 different electron transition to energy level 2 in hydrogen use my data i determine my experimental value of the rydberg constant and compare it to the value of r ∞ i calculate use equation 4 use know value see appendix 2 one improvement on my experimental method would be to repeat the measurement i make a i only record one measurement for each wavelength and for each order then i would 've be able to improve the precision of my result and hence the error bar on graph 1 2 and 3 would 've be small i would 've be able to achieve well overall accuracy in the experiment a possible source of error that i do n't take into account be the diffraction grate although it be write on the grate frame that n 300 line per mm i do n't find out whether that claim be actually true or not also by look at the grate spectrometer setup fig 2 it can be see that clamp be use to hold the diffraction grate which could 've bent it and therefore affected the result other factor which i could 've take into account to improve my result be thing such a spectrometer misalignment because even after try to align the spectrometer the slit image in the eyepiece be n't completely vertical air pressure might also affect the hydrogen atom in the hydrogen discharge lamp in addition the rydberg formula itself which be a result of the bohr model of hydrogen be n't completely accurate and have it limitation the bohr model assumes that the nucleus of the hydrogen have infinite mass hence the notation r ∞ and that the proton be stationary in reality both the proton and the electron rotate around their common centre of mass see figure 3 6 `` it turn out that this motion can be take into account by not use the electron 's rest mass in equation 4 but instead the reduce mass of the proton and the electron to get more accurate result `` for my experiment i could 've use the reduce mass of the system bibliography 1 freedman r et al\"\n"," \"the rydberg constant be found to be r∞

eventually they collide with a neutral atom which transfer electron to the cation when the electron be transfer it fall from high energy level to low one in the hydrogen atom thus emit a photon to conserve energy a it potential energy decrease note these lamp be fundamentally different to incandescent lamp where a whole nearly continuous spectrum of light be emit the wavelength λ of the photon emit in the hydrogen gas-discharge lamp be give by the equation 1 originally posit by johannes rydberg where p be the initial principle quantum number and q be the final principle quantum number thus the rydberg constant may be found if λ p and q be know the rydberg constant can be interpret a the high wavenumber of a photon possible emit from an electron decrease it energy level in hydrogen by take p 1 and q ∞ the light from the lamp may be pas through a lens to collimate the light before be disperse by a diffraction grate if we assume the grate slit width be small compare with the wavelength we can assume the light will diffract uniformly this allows each slit to act a a secondary source the light from each secondary source will then interfere with light from other secondary source in this case an interference pattern will be produce in which the angle θ at which each order maximum appear be give by equation 2 where n be the order of the maximum and d be the slit space 5 use a diffraction grate reduces the intensity of the light between the maximum and so increase the resolve power of the apparatus the point where line of light appear in the pattern be point where the

these be the wavelength that be measure during the experiment the balmer series be particularly useful in astronomy a hydrogen be the most common element in the universe the doppler shift of a star 's

use a vernier scale with even high resolution although the resolution be already very good o verall the experiment be very successful the initial goal of calculate the rydberg constant be achieve with extremely low uncertainty of 1.67 largely due to the use of the vernier scale and diffraction grate the value of the rydberg constant that we found be r ∞ 1.080 ± 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 which be very close to and within our uncertainty of the codata accepted value of r ∞ 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 if the experiment be to be repeat a darker room and brighter hydrogen lamp could be use in order to improve the

dimensionless m e the electron mass kg c the speed of light m/s and h plank 's constant kg m 2 s −1 and due to this relation strict confines on the value of r ∞ can be use to restrict the value of

difference and order number the graph suggests that there be linear relationship between sine of angle and order number for red light the gradient of the graph obtain by the computer be 5.3446×10 table 2 show 11 set of angle and correspond order for the green light a graph be obtain from those data by use computer show in fig 4 fig 4 linear relationship between sin of angle difference and order number for green spectral line the graph suggests that there be linear relationship between sine of angle and order number for green light the gradient of the graph obtain by the computer be 3.906×10 ± 1.139×10 o the wavelength calculate from the gradient be 4.96×10 s m. the uncertainty of the wave length of red light be 1.139×10 o × 2 st.t ×10 o 1.45×10 t hence the wavelength of red light be 4.96×10 s ± 1.45×10 t m. from the research the green light the electron transition from 4 th to 2 nd energy level so the uncertainty of 𝑅 be a a result the rydberg constant for the green light be 10800000 ± 314000 𝑚 2 the mean value of rydberg constant be the percentage uncertainty of the rydberg constant be 8.3 which be quite small there be some main cause of the error in the experiment the spectrometer itself have error such a the vernier scale be not evenly distribute and the telescope may not be align perfectly a well the line of spectrum have width and the edge be not clear so we could not determine the angle precisely the eye be not perpendicular to the plane of vernier scale also make the reading have uncertainty this experiment be design to measure the spectrum of hydrogen and deduce the value of rydberg constant by use spectrometer to measure the wavelength in balmer series directly the angle be measure to obtain the wavelength of the light by use diffraction then the rydberg constant be calculate from the rydberg formula only two wavelength be measure in the experiment in the case n=3 and 4. our result of rydberg constant be 10700000±990000𝑚 2 which have a reasonable uncertainty around 8 this result contain the predict value of rydberg constant which be 10973731.6 𝑚 2 although this result be not bad but we still found many systematic and random error in the experiment the main systemic error be that the spectral line have width which make the reading not accurate relative motion between transition atom and detector and the sensitivity of the equipment may cause this problem in the experiment the appearance of unexpected belt of light cause by the unwanted light in the laboratory also make the experiment inaccurate put a cover over the spectrometer may solve this problem there be also some random error in the experiment when we turn the telescope the pan of vernier scale may slide slightly a mention before eye may be not perpendicular to the vernier scale which also cause the reading inaccurate during the observation we do not see the violet light because of lack of intensity of the hydrogen lamp in order to get the result of the violet light a high energy hydrogen lamp should be use\"\n"," \"the rydberg constant r∞ relates the wavelength of light emit by an excite hydrogen atom and the correspond energy level when a hydrogen atom be excite it then de-excites to the ground state emit a photon the energy and therefore the wavelength of this photon be dependent on the discrete energy level the atom be excite to initially a spectrometer with a 300 line per mm grate be use to measure the wavelength of light produce by a hydrogen lamp our value for the rydberg constant be 1.1025×10 7 ± 2.5×10 4 m −1 the 0.22 error be small thus show that our experiment produce a precise value however the accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10,973,731.6 m −1 which do n't lie within our error range thus our value be not accurate t he aim of this experiment be to show how the grate spectrometer can be use to determine a precise and accurate value of the rydberg constant which this report will detail the rydberg constant relates the discrete wavelength of light that can be emit from an excite atom to the correspond energy level the atom have transition between these wavelength be discrete because the energy level to which the atom can transition to be quantise i.e they take specific value this be outline in section ii we use a hydrogen lamp a a source of excite hydrogen atom and shone the light through the spectrometer to produce the hydrogen emission spectrum the angle each spectral line make with the central maximum be measure and thus the wavelength be determine for each colour of light the spectrometer be utilised because it be capable of precise measurement with a potential minimum uncertainty of three part in ten thousand this be because it u a vernier scale which be accurate to 1 arcminute this allows for precise alignment when set up the spectrometer far detailed in section iii and also precise measurement a a result we be able to reduce the uncertainty in our value to 0.22 which be small when white light pas through a diffraction grate an interference pattern be produce where a series of repeat rainbow continuous spectrum be observe 1 the angle that each order maximum make with the zeroth order maximum be dependent on the wavelength of the light hence the series of continuous spectrum i.e the 'breaking up of the light because the light emit by the hydrogen lamp be compose of discrete wavelength the spectrum observe will have line instead of a continuum we use the spectrometer to measure the aforementioned angle and then equation 1 be use to calculate the correspond wavelength 2 where m be the m th order maximum λ be the wavelength in metre d be adjacent slit space in the grate in metre and sin θ be the sine of the angle from the central maximum each order be observe when a hydrogen atom be excite it electron transition to high energy level these level be quantise because the electron require a specific amount of energy to transition when the hydrogen atom de-excites the electron cascade through these energy level and the energy lose be emit a a photon equation 2shows how the energy of this photon be dependent on the difference between energy level where e photon be photon energy in joule e n m be atomic energy level in joule where n m h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light in vacuo and λ be wavelength in metre 3 equation 3 be the rydberg equation where λ be wavelength in metre r ∞ be the rydberg constant in m −1 and n be the energy level 4 the spectral line observe be within the visible range know a the balmer series where in this equation p 2 and in equation 2 m 2. this mean the atom be transition from n ≥ 3 to n 2. red light be observe when n 3 blue when n 4 and violet when n 5. there be several important component in the spectrometer namely the slit and collimator diffraction grate and the telescope a see in figure 1. the latter two be both move fig 1 a schematic diagram of the grate spectrometer show the main component the light source be a hydrogen lamp and the diffraction grate be 300 line mm −1 5 part whose movement can be finely adjust and measure relative to a rotate angular vernier scale it design allows for these part to be fully fix in position or to be move a require in the alignment process the spectrometer utilises a vernier scale precise to 1 arcminute or 1 60 th of a degree the light passing through the collimator must be at normal incidence to the diffraction grate therefore the alignment of the diffraction grate and telescope be vital to take precise measurement the telescope and eyepiece instrument have a crosshair which be use a a reference point to align the telescope with the centre of each spectral line the crosshair therefore have to be in focus when view an image to do this careful adjustment of the eyepiece be make furthermore the telescope must be focus such that a clear image of the spectrum be visible this be achieve by focus the telescope such that a distant object be clearly visible to precisely align the move part firstly the telescope be align such that an image of the central maximum be in line with the crosshair thus ensure the light be enter the telescope at 180 ± 1 20 ° by fix one part of the vernier scale the telescope be rotate through 90 ± 1 60 ° this angle be measure by note the initial reading on the vernier scale and move to a position 90 ± 1 60 °clockwise from this the diffraction grate holder be then rotate to a position such that a reflect image be at normal incidence to the telescope i.e 45 ± 1 20 ° to the light exit the collimator whilst the telescope be fix the grate be rotate back through 45± 1 60 ° so it be at normal incidence to the light exit the collimator this alignment be measure in the same way a the telescope finally the grate be fix in this position and the telescope be unfixed allow it to move to make the reading all error on these value will be justified in section iv after the spectrometer be correctly align the 300 line mm −1 diffraction grate be place into it holder a 300 line mm −1 be use a oppose to one with few line e.g the 80 line mm −1 also available because it produce a large angle of diffraction thus reduce the percentage error on each angle measurement a narrow slit be use to reduce the width of each spectral line and the collimator to straighten the beam meaning the whole beam be at normal incidence to the grate the telescope be then move into a position where the crosshair be align with the centre of the central maximum the width of the central maximum n 0 be measure to account for the uncertainty on this measurement this process be repeat for each observe colour measure the angle the n th order maximum occur for red and blue 3 ≥ n ≥ -3 and for violet 2 ≥ n ≥ -2 along with the width of each spectral line measure in arcminute because visual interpretation have an effect on view the spectral line two measurement be make for each order to reduce this uncertainty the experiment be perform in a darken room such that there be no effect on the measurement from background light which would otherwise reduce the clarity of the spectral pattern when take measurement we identify three main source of contribute error these be glare and parallax when take measurement on the metal vernier scale uncertainty when align the crosshair with the middle of each spectral line and uncertainty a a result of visual interpretation the precision of the vernier scale would usually be ± 1 120 ° because it small increment be 1 60 ° however because of the low-light condition a magnify glass and torch be use to read the scale the glare of this light on the metal make the scale difficult to read the size of the magnify glass meant that it be too big for the spectrometer meaning measurement use the vernier scale be take at a distance and at an angle to the scale to account for this we have use an increase uncertainty of ± 1 60 ° the width of the central maximum be measure to be 1 20 ° hence the large error bar for m 0 in figure 2 and the width of every other spectral line be 1 60 ° a mention in the method section we take two set of reading for every measurement to account for the error associate with visual interpretation these reading be average and the error be fig 2 a python graph show sin θ against m for each observe wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum iii therefore σ/ √ 2 where σ be the standard deviation therefore the aforementioned error regard the parallax width of the spectral line and standard deviation of the mean be add in quadrature for each measurement of θ. thereafter the error on sin θ be calculate and subsequently plot a error bar on figure 2. to reduce the effect background light would have on the clarity of the spectrum the room be fully black out with the exception of desk lamp this therefore reduce the uncertainty associate with visual interpretation by make the observe spectrum clearer however high order spectral line be still less distinct i.e when m ≥ ±2 this be down to an issue with our setup where despite our best effort not all of the light from the lamp be passing into the collimator this cause light to enter the telescope when it be at large angle from the normal of the grate subsequently reduce the clarity of the spectrum at these high order furthermore use the accepted value of the rydberg constant and set n 6 the resultant wavelength be within the visible range with a wavelength ∼ 410 nm however this be not observe in our spectrum this be most likely due to the issue i have just outline in conjunction with the inconvenience that some group have desk lamp turn on whilst we be take measurement the red and blue spectral line be the clearest and the violet line be only see when m ≤ ±2 this suggests that this error affected small wavelength hence the overall absence of the light correspond to n 6 and m ±3 for n 5. our value for the rydberg constant be 1.1025×10 7 ± 2.5×10 4 m −1 figure 3 show value of the wavelength calculate use data obtain from figure 2 and equation 1. the correspond value of the rydberg constant be calculate from equation 3 use these wavelength the uncertainty on the wavelength be the error on the gradient in figure 2 divide by d. the uncertainty on the rydberg constant be calculate from equation 3 use the aforementioned error the overall uncertainty on our value of r ∞ be the three error add in quadrature the percentage error for our value be 0.22 which be small thus demonstrate the overall precision of our experiment the accepted value of r ∞ be 10,973,731.6 m −1 this be just below the low bound for our value which be 11,000,000 m −1 although it be close to this low bound be ∼ 26,000 m −1 below it this therefore mean that our experiment do not produce an accurate value this be likely due to a systematic error the value of the wavelength correspond to n 3 4 5 calculate use the accepted value of r ∞ and equation 3 our value be all small this therefore explains why our value for r ∞ be big than the accepted value because equation 3 u λ −1 i believe the systematic error have most likely be cause by damage to the diffraction grate cause it to have a small slit space this would produce small value of λ from equation 1. the percentage difference between the value be 0.57 0.52 0.44 respectively the error on these percentage be negligible these value be similar which show that it be a systematic error rather than a random one the purpose of this experiment be to determine an accurate and precise value for the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer our value be 1.1025×10 7 ± 2.5×10 4 m −1 this mean we be successful in determine a precise value because the percentage error for our value be low at 0.22 however we be unsuccessful in determine an accurate one a more precise value could 've be obtain by use a spectrometer with a high degree of precision along with a clearer scale e.g a digital one to reduce glare furthermore by take more measurement in addition have the hydrogen lamp be design in a well way such to reduce it aperture and the experiment have be conduct in isolation the effect of background light would have be nil lastly the diffraction grate use should 've be checked for damage or a brand new one should 've be use to avoid any chance of damage nullify the systematic error this have on our experiment\"\n"," 'in this experiment we use spectrometry technique to find the value of the rydberg constant we first set up our spectrometer and we measure the spectrum of hydrogen by passing the light of a hydrogen lamb through a diffraction grate we then measure the scatter angle of some visible light then we could deduce the wavelength of these light with the formula for interference with diffraction grate and use the equation for transition wavelength in hydrogen to obtain 𝑹 ∞ 𝟏𝟎𝟖𝟏𝟒𝟎𝟎𝟎 ± 𝟓𝟏𝟎𝟎𝟎𝒎 −𝟏 his report discus an experiment to obtain a value for the rydberg constant the rydberg constant relates energy level change of an electron in a hydrogen atom to the wavelength of the light emit a there be certain energy level in the hydrogen atom the hydrogen atom can only emit electromagnetic radiation of certain wavelength thus the rydberg constant can relate energy emit and energy level change in a hydrogen atom in this experiment we be only investigate electromagnetic radiation that be within the visible spectrum for a hydrogen atom the visible light emit will be in the balmer series which will simplify the whole experiment a show in the theory part in this experiment we determine wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emit from the hydrogen lamb by passing them through a diffraction grate thus idea about interference through a grate need to be consider at bright fringe of a wavelength of electromagnetic radiation the phase difference be always an integer multiple of 2𝜋 while at a dark fringe the phase difference be always odd integer multiple of 𝜋. assume the view distance of the observer be large enough the ray will be parallel and we can deduce that the path difference between 2 ray ∆𝑙 ∆𝑙 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 from diagram 1 below where d be the slit separation and 𝜃 be the angle of the 2 ray from the horizontal phase difference ∆𝜑 be related to path difference ∆𝑙 a suggest by the equation below where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation with the above equation we could deduce that the angle at which bright fringe appear be give by 𝑛𝜆 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 eq 2 where d be the slit separation we could use this equation to deduce the wavelength of visible light from the hydrogen lamb a hydrogen atom can only emit electromagnetic radiation of certain wavelength due to the fix energy level for electron in the atom wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation be determine by the transition of the electron between these energy level the transition wavelength be give by the formula below where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 𝜆 be the transition wavelength n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level in this experiment we be only observe the light within the visible spectrum and this reduces the difficulty to distinguish what electron jump correspond to which light a visible light be in the balmer series and this series correspond to wavelength cause by electron jump find the rydberg constant with spectroscopy t 2 from nth energy level to the second energy level p=2 we start off by set up the spectrometer a the diagram 2. we focus the camera lens onto a distant object without use grate and view it at the eyepiece to check there be no parallax between the image and the cross wire a parallax will cause huge error in our measurement we then use a sodium lamp instead of hydrogen a our light source because the hydrogen lamp may die if it open for a long period we then find the angle at where the central maximum be find this angle simplify the experiment a we can use the angle difference between the nth maximum and the central maximum to determine the wavelength use equation 2 we use the spectrometer set up a diagram 2 to measure angle where bright fringe appear for visible light 1 and 2. for both color we take the angle at center of the bright fringe a the measurement and this cause uncertainty a it be impossible to determine the exact location of the center for each fringe we use the 78.8 line per mm grate in this experiment a it produce pattern with reasonable separation between fringe and high number of fringe across the 180 degree view angle we measure from -3th order to 2th order for each color a more data will reduce the random error of the result to reduce the error far me and my lab partner measure these angle independently with the location of bright fringe of color 1 and 2 we can plot sin∆𝜃 against n where ∆𝜃 be the angle difference between the angle measure and the angle where central maximum be and n be the order a sin∆𝜃 and n follow a linear relationship the slope of the graph will be 𝜆 𝑑 we could obtain the value of 𝜆 by measure the slope of the graph we can use the value of 𝜆 in equation 3 a we already know p=2 for visible light and we assign value of n to color 1 and 2 by the method of trial and error we know we will find the correct value for n when the two value of 𝑅 ∞ calculate from the n value of color 1 and 2 be similar and close to the accepted value 10973731.6. with the correct value of n we could obtain the value of the rydberg constant by rearrange ∆𝜃 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒 n order ∆𝜃 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒 -3 6.17 -2 4.17 -1 2.17 0 0.17 1 -1.83 2 -3.83 the reference angle at the 0 th order bright fringe be 172°10′ ± 0.2° we could obtain the value of ∆𝜗 by the follow equation where 𝜃 be the measurement from the spectrometer and 𝜃 𝑅𝐸𝐹 be the reference angle at the 0 th order bright fringe we estimate the random error of the measurement by take measurement independently between lab partner and we find that there be around 0.2° difference for every measurement we make we think this error arise from the fact that it be impossible to locate the center of the bright fringe accurately a some of the fringe have low intensity and they be blur this uncertainty propagates to ∆𝜃 all ∆𝜃 measurement will have a 0.4° uncertainty with the table above we plot sin∆𝜃 against n a show below in this graph the slope will be − 𝜆 𝑑 a i assign positive 𝑠𝑖𝑛∆𝜃 value for negative n. we can rearrange and obtain value for 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 use some computational line fitting technique we can obtain the follow value for 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 where 𝜆 1 =663±1 nm and 𝜆 2 442 ± 1 nm we can then deduce the value for the rydberg constant use equation 3 a we have make observation on two visible light we can reduce the random error for the result of rydberg constant by take the average of value derive from the two wavelength 𝑅 ∞ 10810000±50000 𝑚 −1 a we know 𝑅 ∞ only depend on wavelength when n be fix from equation 3 we could work out that the follow relationship with this equation we could obtain ℴ 𝑅 ∞ =50000 the aim of this experiment be to find the rydberg constant in this experiment we use a spectrometer with a grate to determine the wavelength of light emit from a hydrogen lamb and we work out the rydberg constant use equation 3 i think we have obtain some reasonably good measurement in this experiment which lead to a very close result to the accepted value however we spend too much time refining our data and we lack the time to estimate systematic error of the experiment such a misalignment of the spectrometer and lamp position etc i think we could improve this experiment by make more estimation about systematic error after this experiment i become more experienced at use the spectrometer and gain more insight about how spectroscopy can be use in different field of physic'\n"," \"can be consider accurate furthermore a the percentage uncertainty be very low 0.432 we can also say that there be a relatively high precision by this method the rydberg constant r∞ be hugely important in atomic physic and help to relate transition wavelength λt to the energy level which the electron have transition from with the equation where n and p be integer which represent the initial and final state of the atom when the rydberg constant be first establish it be do so empirically in order to make sense of the rydberg equation when apply to a hydrogen spectrum however it have since be show that it can be calculate from more fundamental constant far validate the value this feature be also why the rydberg be so useful it be one of the most precisely know constant so it be very useful when utilized in equation 1 for instance use the rydberg equation transition wavelength can be determine with a very low uncertainty to get such a precise value i have use a grate spectrometer a spectrometer essentially creates a collimate beam of light which be then disperse use a 78.8 mm -1 diffraction grate the spectrum can then be observe use an eyepiece and angle can be record through a vernier scale a long a the spectrometer be correctly calibrate i would hope to achieve very precise result to do this i will have to take measure to reduce the uncertainty of human judgement in part of the method this will be achieve by repeat reading from two or more people or by incorporate digital equipment into the method e.g camera to read vernier scale ii theory spectroscopy be the study and analysis of a spectrum of light the grate spectrometer i have use u the phenomenon of diffraction to separate the collimate light beam into it spectrum this occurs a the individual wavelength of light which sum together to form the beam diffract by different amount the angle of diffraction θ can be link to the wavelength λ by the equation where n be the order of the maximum and d be the space between each slit in the diffraction grate we use a slit space of 1.269x10 -5 m a this produce good spectral pattern for analysis maximum appear during diffraction due to the superposition of wave front at a maximum the path difference between the two wave must be an integer number of wavelength determine the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk a previously mention and show by equation 1 the rydberg constant demonstrates the wavelength of the photon which be emitted/absorbed when there be a change in energy within the atom this due to the discrete energy level which exist within an atom and be explain use the bohr model of the atom figure 1 show some of the more common transition within the hydrogen atom the balmer series in hydrogen be the transition which result in visible photon wavelength contrastingly the lyman series exist in the ultraviolet range and the paschen series in the infrared range bohr also help to show the rydberg constant can not just be found empirically but can also be express use fundamental constant by where α be the fine structure constant me be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be planck 's constant 4 by substitute in the equation for the fine structure constant we have an even more fundamental equation with where e be the charge of an electron and εo be the permittivity of free space iii method to carry out precise measurement it be imperative that the grate spectrometer be correctly calibrate the spectrometer must be in focus and free of parallax so we focus the eyepiece onto the cross hair which be in the middle of the telescope and we could then focus the camera lens onto an image at approximately ten metre away so that the parallel light ray would be in focus when they pa through the camera lens at this point it be important that the lamp be ready to be use and must be place a closely to the slit a possible whilst be completely on view to the slit this be so that the only light come through the eyepiece be from the lamp with the maximum intensity available we ensure the camera collimator and eyepiece be parallel and we change the focus of the collimator so that the slit gap be in focus in the eyepiece from this point it be important that we do not change the focus on any part of the spectrometer a we would then have to repeat the entire process we then place the diffraction grate in to it holder make sure we do not touch the surface and that it be completely vertical we use 78.8mm -1 diffraction grate with this value be determine by the manufacturer from this point we rotate the telescope 90° secure in into position with a screw and proceed to rotate the grate until the entrance of the slit be reflect into the eyepiece approximately 45° we do not need to adjust the height of the image a it be in a good position however we could have do this by use the plate screw if require we record the angle on the vernier scale and continued to rotate the grate through exactly 45° so that the plate be at a 0° incidence we be now happy that the spectrometer be calibrate however we move the telescope around to observe some of the spectral line to confirm that they be be show and be vertical when calibrate correctly and with enough repeat the spectrometer will produce uncertainty of approximately ±0.2nm in order to reduce the effect of human judgement increase this uncertainty we place the camera from a smart phone in a set position to take picture of the vernier scale when an angle need to be measure this reduces uncertainty a it stop the error in reading from an arcminute scale the uncertainty from reading off the scale be reduce from ±1/12° to approximately ±1/120° a sodium lamp be use to collect some preliminary data during the prelimina1y investigation the optimal size of the slit space be dete1mined which would remain constant throughout the experiment and we also decide that the 78.smm-1 be the grate which produce the clearest pattern so that would also remain constant throughout the experiment we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp and begin to record data a see from the balmer series there be 4 main transition which result in visible photon and we will observe 3 transition and take angle measurement for each we be observe red blue and purple band for each colour band we observe the zero order and record the next two maximum on the positive and negative side we would record the order with it correspond angle from the vernier scale when take these reading there be an uncertainty in the width of the band that you be observe to minimize this unce1iainty we each take a reading from both edge of the band and take an average to get a well estimate of where the centre of the band be to finiher decrease the unce1iainty we then take take an average of our own individual measurement use equation 2 we could plot a graph of sin0 a a function of the order of the maximum in this case 0 be the angle from the zero-order maximum this give u a precise estimate of the wavelength of each transition we then use equation 1 to plot the transition wavelength against the transition energy level to detennine the rydberg constant when take measurement for 0 it be very imp01iant that there be no background source of light so the experiment be canied out in a blacked-out room with small desk lamp background light could interfere with the spectrum and reduce the intensity of the spectrum in the eyepiece this would increase the unce1iainty in our measurement other factor which must also remain constant be the humidity and air pressure in the environment ignore negligible fluctuation these be involunta1ily kept constant moreover during the experiment we encounter an issue with the hydrogen lamp they can only be use for time span of around fifteen minute before they overheat and stop work we have one hydrogen lamp break when we be near the end of the experiment despite be the same model from the same manufacturer we still expect to have different result from the new lamp this could be take a a major source of error to dete1mine the rydberg constant we first have to have accurate estimate of the transition wavelength of the emission band we be observe from figure 3 you can see that each band follow a linear relationship which pas through the origin the gradient at each point be equivalent to the transmission wavelength divide by the slit space use this data we compute the wavelength of each band the wavelength of the red band be 622.6 ± 0.7 nm the blue band be 493.3 ± 0.6 nm and the purple band have a wavelength of 444.0 ± 0.9 mn when compru ed to the balmer series these wavelength agree with the actual transition wavelength so they can be consider accurnte the main enors that arose in the wavelength be the enors from measure the diffraction angle of each band which manifest itself in the value of sin0 the calibration of the spectrnmeter be a cause of systematic error even tl1ough the spectrometer be calibrate carefully it be largely do by eye so we can expect a small yet non-negligible constant enor throughout the result i estimate this to be approximately ±0.3nm another major source of systematic euor be the change of the hydrogen lamp midway through our experiment a previously mention the model be the same however they can not be expect to perf01m in the same way i take this to be a systematic enor which be only prevalent in the data record after the change from when the lamp change the relationship still seem to follow a consistent b'end with no real sign of fluctuation fmthe1more a the lamp be the same model and be manufacture at a similar time i have take tl1e e1rnr to be negligible random enors have also be consider despite reading from a camera there be still random enor in reading from the vernier scale i approximate this to be ±0.18nm by observe the small change of angle which could be dete1mined and use equation 2 to check the change in wavelength additionally background source of light do become a sligl1t issue and we do find slight drop in intensity at point which create more unce1iainty when take reading when this occuned we ensmed that the background light be remove and we remeasured the value to get an eitor from a measurement of wavelength we add the eitors in quadrature to get a set eitor of ±0.35nm for every measurement this then have to be add in quadrature to the enor which occmted due to the width of the band of light this be the individual main somce of eitor and it account on average to 50 of each eitor on the wavelength on figme 3 there be no euor bar show a they be so small that they affected the clarity of the data point therefore i remove them we then analyse the wavelength of the emission band use equation 1 the gradient of the graph show in figme 3 be equal to the rydberg constant use the gradient and tl1e eitors which have be estimate practically the value of the rydberg constant be 1094599 ± 15872 m• 1 this show a percentage uncertainty of 0.145 and a percentage euor from the actual rydberg constant 10973739.6m-1 of 0.253 this mean that the actual value of the rydberg constant do not lie in the range of nnceitainty these enors be somced from the e1rnrs in the reciprocal of the wavelength a there be no eitors in the x direction on figme 3. the e1tors here be equivalent to the percentage enors from dete1mining the wavelength for confumation i analyse the graph in figure 3 statistically use a co-variance matrix function which can be found in the scipy module in python this result in a rydberg constant of 1094599 ± 47287 m• 1 from tlus there be now a 0.432 uncertainty so the actual value do now lie in the range of unce1iainty this show that the statistical variation be indeed great than the practical unceitainties that i estimate so i chose to use the statistical unce1tainty in my final value due to this we can say that the experiment be more accurate than initially thought a the expect value be in the coitect range from my experimental value contrnstingly the experiment be not a precise a initially calculate because the percentage uncertainty do in fact increase when statistical method be use this be cause by the random enor in estimate the centre of the enussion band because it be accountable for over 50 of the total enor when the wavelength be compute it be the large source of eitor so it have the most affect when add in quadratm•e v. conclusion the goal of the experiment be to determine a precise and accurate measurement of the rydberg constant we be observe the spectrum from a hydrogen lamp to identify and analyse the balmer series to compute the rydberg constant from it a grate spectrometer be use to diffract the collimate light beam and the angle of diffraction of the maximum be analyse my final value of the rydberg constant be 1094599 ± 47287 m -1 which result in a 0.253 error from the true value with our equipment and skill level i believe we make an accurate and very precise measurement of the rydberg constant this be due to the percentage uncertainty and our error be very small consider human judgement be require in the experiment you can usually rely on human error be in the 2-3 area 5 at least whereas our error be 10 time small than this expect value due to this our value can be consider accurate in order to improve this experiment i would consider a more modern approach to the grate spectrometer a spectrometer which can be programmed to optimise itself in term of grate type and slit size and can identify where maximum exactly lie this would virtually remove all random error from the method make the experimental value much more precise\"\n"," \"the wavelength of visible light emit from the balmer

si unit 1 use a pasco model sp-9268 student spectrometer 2 common in most undergraduate physic laboratory the rydberg constant be calculate to within 0.24 of the accepted value 3 consideration of systematic error be vital in this experiment and be the limit factor in the accuracy of the measurement by reduce the systematic error a much a possible a measurement of r ∞ to within less than 0.5 be comfortably achievable with this spectrometer in 1913 niels bohr postulate that an electron can move in stable approximately circular orbit without emit radiation or lose energy 4 the energy of a photon e photon a radiation light be emit be give by where e i and e f denote the initial and final energy of the photon a it emits radiation and fall to a low energy level the final energy level that the photon fall to determines what spectral series be observe during this experiment the wavelength of light due to electron transition in hydrogen atom be measure from a high energy level to the second level n 2 if each energy level be label n 1 n 2 n 3 and so on then the electron transition for a hydrogen atom be call the lyman series 5 n 1 the balmer series 6 n 2 the paschen series 6 n 3 and the brackett series 7 n 4 these transition be show in fig 1 transition to high energy level have also be observe though the spectral line become fainter a the likelihood of a transition to an energy level great than n 6 be quite uncommon electron transition in the balmer series that fall to n 2 emit radiation in the visible spectrum use a hydrogen lamp and the spectrometer the wavelength

level if we compare the relative mass of a proton 8 m proton 1.67 × 10 −27 kg to that of an electron 9 m e 9.11×10 −31 kg then it a reasonable assumption that m proton m e the mass of a proton be ≈ 1840 time that of an electron use this assumption and bohr 's postulate we can equate the electrical force f e and the centripetal force f c act on an electron where 0 be the permittivity of free space r n be the orbital radius around the n th shell and v n be the speed of the electron 's orbit all in si unit all other symbol carry the same meaning a define in equation 1 these two force can be equate since the electron and proton have opposite charge with the electron orbit the proton and the assumption that no other force act the radius of the electron 's orbit and it speed be give by and respectively bohr far postulate that 'the angular momentum of the electron round the nucleus in a stationary state of the system be equal to an entire multiple of a universal value independent of the charge on the nucleus 4 in fig 2 the electron can be see in yellow emit radiation a it transition from n 3 to n 2 this be a balmer series spectral line and occurs in the visible spectrum bohr go on to show that the angular momentum of an electron be a quantise integer multiple of h 2π 4 we can therefore write where n ∈ z now rewrite the expression for r n and v n a and equate to equation 4 and 5 respectively we find that and for a hydrogen atom in it ground state the most likely position of the electron occurs at n 1. this be know a the bohr radius r bohr 10 apply the principle of conservation of energy allows the sum of the kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p to be write a a constant e t conservation of energy tell u that substitute the expression for r n and v n from equation 9 and 10 into equation 11 use the familiar and yield the energy of radiation emit a an electron fall from it initial excite energy state n i to a low final state n f give by equation 2 can be express a the speed of light c wavelength of light λ and frequency f be related by for light travel in a vacuum use the planck-einstein relation 11 that the energy of an emit photon of light be related to it frequency by where h be the planck constant equation 15 can be rearrange 12 to where r ∞ m e e 4 8 0 2 ch 3 m −1 19 to determine a value for the rydberg constant the wavelength of light along with it uncertainty be measure during the experiment electron transition of the balmer series be observe in particular transition from n 3 to n 2 and from n 4 to n 2 use equation 18 and the value of r ∞ quote in the laboratory manual 13 r ∞ 10 973 731.6m −1 wavelength of λ red 656nm and λ blue 486nm should correspond to these two transition respectively these wavelength value be calculate use the currently accepted value of r ∞ so that the two colour of light red and blue be know before start the experimental work when a wave of wavelength λ pas through a small slit the wave be diffract and spread out in a circular path if there be multiple slit of separation distance d such a on a diffraction grate then lot of circular wavefront be form a the wave diffracts through numerous slit these wavefront interfere result in constructive and destructive interference for constructive interference two wave must superpose at a maximum so they be in-phase the path difference between two adjacent slit be λ and so a righttriangle can be construct a in fig 3 such that due to the sinusoidal nature of wave successive minimum and maximum will occur a the wavefront progress maximum be observe for any integer number of λ though the intensity of successive maximum will decrease a the diffraction increase we find therefore that where m ∈ z and be call the order number a student pasco model sp-9268 spectrometer 2 be use to calculate the wavelength of red and blue light emit from a hydrogen lamp a excite electron transition from n 4 and n 3 to the second energy level n 2 equation 21 be use to measure the angle θ at which maximum be observe for order number m ±1 ±2 and ±3 far order number be not visible a the intensity of light at m ≥ 4 be too low to record accurate measurement a graph of sin θ against order number m be plot for the red and blue light value of λ red and λ blue be then calculate by where d the number of slit per unit length be know value of r ∞ with their associate error be then calculate from equation 18 ensure that the telescope be clearly focus so that well define line of interference could be observe the hydrogen lamp be place near the collimator slit the width of the slit be adjust until the red and blue line be clearly visible and focus the direction of travel of the light be show by black arrow in fig 4 a transmission diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre be use to cause diffraction of the light and for the wavelength to be measure 21 allows for the wavelength to then be calculate adapt from 11 a label set-up of the apparatus use in the experiment be show in fig 5 the telescope be firstly focus on a distant object at the other side of the laboratory minor adjustment to the lens be make to ensure that it be exactly in focus use the focus knob on the top of the telescope for the initial set-up of the apparatus a sodium lamp be use to align the lens this be to eliminate the risk of the hydrogen lamp overheat the sodium lamp be place very close to the collimator slit and the power supply be switch on the telescope be point at the slit and a sharp focus image of the light be observe the angle of rotation of the telescope be note from the vernier scale at this point it be then rotate through 90 • a mirror be place in the grate holder and the grate table be rotate through 45 • so that the slit be reflect and visible from the telescope 's eyepiece the telescope be then return to it original position and a diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre be insert into the grate holder at this point well define blue and red slit could be see through the eyepiece to improve the accuracy of measurement fig 5 a label image of the experimental set up most part of the spectrometer be visible on the image though a few can not be see the slit adjustment be locate to the left of the collimator focus knob and be use to narrow or widen the slit of light from the lamp at the end of the telescope not visible be the eyepiece with cross-hair alignment the cross-hairs can be rotate and be position in such a way to produce an x shape a oppose to a '+ on the underside of the telescope be an adjustment knob use to make small alteration to the focus of the telescope when reading numerical value from the vernier scale a hand held magnify glass be use to reduce the likelihood of misread the scale occasionally use the magnify glass be not very effective if for example the table rotation handle align exactly over the vernier scale in such situation a mobile phone camera be use to capture the scale at an appropriate zoom to reduce the possibility of random error one person take all the reading from the vernier scale whilst the other control the alignment of the telescope a parallax error also have to be consider when take reading from the vernier scale this error be minimise by position the magnify glass/mobile phone directly above the scale and take reading from this position the resolution of the vernier scale on this grate spectrometer be 1arcminute and so an error of ±1arcminute when reading the scale be reasonable it would not be justified to claim an error of ±0.5arcminutes due to the parallax error which can not entirely be ignore when rotate the telescope to the position of each spectral emission line the physical thickness of these line have to be consider since each diffract beam have a physical width over which the wavelength of light remains the same the beam be measure in two place the angle of rotation of the telescope for each spectral line be measure on the left side and the right side of the beam denote by θ lef t and θ right respectively the cross in fig 6 show where the telescope be align to take these reading the error associate with the width of each beam be add in quadrature to the error from reading the vernier scale the error for the width of the fig 6 a graphic of a diffract beam of blue light be observe through the telescope the telescope 's angle of rotation be record at the two x 's and the mean of the two value take reading of θ lef t and θ right have an uncertainty of ±1arcminute though the width of the beam be significantly large than this beam be give by and varied for each beam the variation be likely due to the increase faintness of high order beam and the uncontrollable background light due to other group in the laboratory in general the width of the beam appear to increase a the order number increase in magnitude this be likely due to the great diffraction and decrease in intensity of the light where more background light be present the beam become more difficult to accurately observe this be reflect in the individual error associate with each of the beam also notable be the large width error for the measurement of blue light compare to red for almost all the measurement the blue beam appear fainter and with more fade edge make the exact position of θ lef t and θ right harder to decipher fig 7 show the variation in beam width for red and blue light for order number −2 ≤ m ≤ 2. these value be all much great than the ±1arcminute error due to reading the vernier scale and so dominate when add in quadrature there be little correlation in the data though the error for blue light be consistently high than that for red light except for one reading when plot sin θ against m to determine the wavelength of the red and blue light the mean value be use this method be use to determine the position of each beam since align the cross-hairs with the centre of the slit be much more subjective and introduces a great random error place the cross-hair exactly on the boundary of the slit result in less random error and tell u the width of the beam when the angle at both side be measure fig 7 a graph of the width of the diffract red and blue beam use a diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre colour accordingly over five order number from equation 21 a plot of sin θ against order number m will yield a straight line of gradient λ d two diffraction grate be available during this experiment one with 80 line per millimetre the other with 300 line per millimetre preliminary experimental data show that use the grate with 300 line per millimetre be much more beneficial for this experiment the sharpness and clarity of the diffract beam increase a the number of slit per unit length increase this meant that it be easy to align the telescope with the left and right side of each beam since the side be more define the space between each beam be on average ≈ 9 • when use the 300line grate compare to ≈ 22 • apart for the 80-line grate a consequence of this space be the number of diffract beam that could be observe beam of order m 2 be not at all visible when the 80-line grate be use however when use the 300-line grate third order beam be visible for red light a θ widtherror of around 25arcminutes be measure for the beam when use the 80-line grate during the experiment only the 300-line grate be use to produce the diffract beam this kept the θ widtherror to a minimum and allow for the maximum number of diffract beam to be observe and their position measure 21 and contains error bar for the angle measure at each diffract beam there be no error along the horizontal axis since the order number be unambiguous and could clearly be count from start at the zeroth order beam the zeroth order beam be identify a be a different colour to all the other beam it position be such that the red and blue light appear in the same place and so a purple colour beam be see error along the vertical axis be dependent upon the vary error θ widtherror define by equation 23 a well a the constant error of ±1arcminute due to take reading from the vernier scale the red line of the graph represent the plot of red light and the blue line represent blue light a red diffract beam of order m −3 could be observe through the telescope though blue light of this order could not be the intensity of the red diffract beam appear great than that of the blue light and perhaps explains why red light of this order could be see but blue not though this be purely speculative fig 8 a graph of sin θ against order number m for red and blue light use a diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre the red line represent the data collect from measurement of red light and the blue line represent the blue light data the dimensionless gradient of the red line be 0.195 ± 0.002 and the gradient of the blue line be 0.16 ± 0.02. from the gradient of the two line show in fig 8 the wavelength of red and blue light be calculate use equation 22 where d 1 3×10 5 m they be found to be λ red 650 ± 7nm and λ blue 530 ± 70nm the large error in λ blue be predominantly due to the uncertainty in the width of the diffract beam and be previously discus in detail use equation 18 two value of the rydberg constant can be calculate use the value and uncertainty of λ red and λ blue these be r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 use the measure wavelength of red light and r ∞ 1.0 ± 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 use the wavelength of blue light these value vary from the accepted value of r ∞ by 1.1 and 9.7 respectively a show in fig 8 the relative error due to the width of each beam be much large than the ±1arcminute error due to reading the vernier scale this be the main cause of uncertainty during the experiment spectrometer misalignment could have introduce a systematic error into the experiment though the risk of this be greatly reduce by practise the alignment multiple time before take measurement the spectrometer be set-up in a well-lit room on a sturdy grate table show in fig 5 the likelihood of misalignment be low so it be a reasonable assumption to treat this error a negligible in comparison to other source a significant source of error that be reflect in the error bar of fig 8 be the position of the hydrogen lamp the lamp be position a close to the collimator slit a possible to ensure that the great intensity of light could be observe through the telescope during preliminary test the lamp be place at a distance 20 ± 1 cm away from the collimator slit and the diffract beam observe the beam be noticeably fainter and their boundary not a well define this result in a much large θ widtherror and so the lamp be place a close to the collimator slit a possible during the experiment for measurement of the blue diffract beam the θ widtherror be generally large than the measurement for red light this may be due to the position of the lamp since it be move between reading of the red and blue diffract beam it be possible that the hydrogen lamp be place slightly off centre and so the boundary of the beam for the blue light be less well define this possible mispositioning could also explain why no third order blue beam could be see since the intensity of light able to pa through the collimator slit be less this systematic error affect the uncertainty in the telescope 's angle θ when measure each of the beam and so be account for in the vertical error bar of fig 8 consider the average difference in the error θ widtherror for the red and blue light the mispositioning of the lamp likely increase the error in the blue light data by ≈ 6arcminutes due to the mispositioning the distance of the hydrogen lamp from the collimator slit be great for the measurement of the blue light compare to red when the hydrogen lamp be place away from the collimator slit not only light from the lamp enters through the slit background light played a part in the uncertainty of the boundary of each of the beam and so this source of error be amplify by the mispositioning of the lamp when measure the blue wavelength during the experiment the laboratory light be switch off though desk light be turn on this result in some light pollution to minimise the effect of this background light the spectrometer and lamp be cover by a coat when reading be be take although this eliminate most of the background light not all of it be block since the result of the background light be an increase uncertainty in the exact boundary of the diffract beam this error be again reflect in the vertical error bar of fig 8 and account for an error of ≈ 4arcminutes for all the reading though inevitably varies for each reading defocus of the telescope could have introduce a small systematic error in the measurement a previously mention the spectrometer be set-up multiple time before data be collect and the telescope focus onto a small blue box at the other side of the laboratory since the image of the beam remain the same clarity throughout the experiment it be a reasonable assumption to treat this systematic error a negligible consider the relative uncertainty of the experimental value for the rydberg constant a weight average of the two can be establish the value of r ∞ calculate from λ red have an error ten time small that than of the value calculate from λ blue use this weight we find r ∞ 10 1.11×10 7 +1.0×10 7 11 ± 10 0.01×10 7 +0.1×10 7 which yield a final weight value of the constant r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 this result lie 0.24 from the accepted value and encompasses the accepted value within the error give measure the wavelength of red and blue light from their emission line in the balmer series from a hydrogen lamp allow for two value of the rydberg constant to be calculate these be r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 use the measure wavelength of red light and r ∞ 1.0 ± 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 use the wavelength of blue light the value lie either side of the accepted value and combine give a weight experimental average of the rydberg constant a r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 effective use of the student pasco model sp-9268 spectrometer to measure the wavelength of light enable a final value of the rydberg constant to be calculate to within 0.24 of the accepted value careful consideration of error and their propagation be crucial in ensure that an accurate result could be calculate the technique use to minimise error such a practise the set-up and alignment of the spectrometer cover the apparatus to block out background light and position the hydrogen lamp such that the intensity of the diffract beam be a large a possible be successful in keep the error relativity low poor experimental technique when measure the wavelength of blue light lead to a large random error the misalignment of the hydrogen lamp and collimator slit result in an increase in background light and consequently a decrease in intensity of the diffract beam both consequently increase the overall uncertainty in the width of each beam and so the error be large to improve on the experimental technique use in this experiment more data should be take across a range of diffraction grate with more data the apparent background noise may be able to be separate and potentially completely remove from the error in the reading diffraction grate with slit space 300 line per millimetre may allow for high order beam to be observe and hence the uncertainty of the gradient in\"\n"," \"he rydberg constant be deduce by the relationship between the transition wavelength and the energy level of the initial and final state of atom when there be an atom drop down from an energy level to another a photon with a specific

initial state can be either of those 4 energy level electron drop between energy level will give off a photon with exact wavelength correspond to the n and p value suppose an electron drop from n=3 to p=2 it can be say that the electron will give off a photon with specific wavelength of 656nm fig 3. a representation of the energy level of electron in hydrogen with only the balmer series lay in the range of the visible spectrum and hence observable to human eye note that the balmer series be give by p=2 and n=3,4,5,6 this be say that electron drop from nth energy to the second p=2 energy level be give off a photon with the wavelength correspond to the n value 3 iii method first be to set up the grate spectrometer simply focus the telescope to a distance object make sure the x see through the telescope be very clear set up the hydrogen lamp and adjust the collimator so the x be on focus to the center of the strip of light through the slit adjust the angular scale and record the 'zero point for future reference place a total reflective mirror on the grate plate rotate the telescope 90 degree from the 'zero point and rotate the grate plate so that the reflection of light from the mirror show the x at the center of the strip of light lock the grate plate and rotate 45 degree back in the direction so that the collimator be parallel to the telescope and perpendicular to the grate plate with the diagram on the top show single strip from the continuous visible spectrum below so through the spectrometer there will be brighter strip of color visible in the continuous spectrum form by the grate define the center with no diffraction a order number 1 move to the left or right with increase integer number i.e m=1,2,3 etc 5 in order to calculate the transition wavelength measure the diffraction angle through the telescope relate to fig 5. rotate the telescope until the x be at the center of the brighter strip of light to record the angle repeat the process for different order number plot a graph of the sine of the diffraction angle against order number relate to equation 1 the transition wavelength can be found relate to the balmer series value of n can be determine and hence the value of the rydberg constant result 1 i have plot graph of sine of the diffraction angle against order number in python a the error be relatively small it can not be see on the graph the

the two result i get 𝑅 ⋈ 10900 ± 250 × 10 3 𝑚 −1 there can be improvement in determine the error in the diffraction angle by consider the width of the strip of light a it be difficult to get the x in the telescope exactly at the center it be worth measure the angle of diffraction of the width at both the left and right boundary of the strip the resolution of the spectrometer can contribute greatly to a systematic error the error in the measure instrument can be determine by do a test when the maximum of one diffraction pattern occurs at the same position a the maximum of another pattern the grate spectrometer be an extremely accurate measure apparatus allow angle measurement precise a arcminute by use the principle of the diffraction grate and the energy level of hydrogen a quite accurate value of the rydberg constant be calculate the hydrogen lamp be quite easily over-heated result in the use of multiple different hydrogen lamp within the measure process this potentially introduce more uncertainty and could be avoid with more care on the time of usage of the lamp the experiment could also be repeat several time in order to reduce the potential error in the process of observe the diffraction pattern there be many external light source come from the background result in extra light strip be introduce this increase the chance of measure the wrong light strip and could be reduce by cover the light source and block all the light come into the telescope\"\n"," \"this investigation involve the determination of rydberg 's constant by mean of use a grate spectrometer to measure the angular displacement of diffract spectral line from a hydrogen lamp first calculate the wavelength of these spectral line and then use the value of these wavelength to calculate value for the rydberg constant the determination by this method produce the accurate result of 1.10±0.04 ×10 7 m −1 1.09± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 thus it be conclude that the set of data from the red diffract spectral line produce the data with the least amount of experimental uncertainty when an electromagnetic emission be diffract whether it be from distant star or a sodium lamp the various wavelength of the emission be diffract at different angle this therefore produce a spectrum of all the wavelength present in the emission where the spectrum will be 'continuous for a solid emitter such a heat metal filament -containing a continuum of wavelength of vary intensity however in the case of electron in heat or electrically excite gas the excitement and follow relaxation of the electron between the discrete energy level of the gas atom cause the spectrum to contain only specific wavelength -those that relate to the size of the discrete energy gap that the electron transition over this be give by λ hc e where λ be the wavelength h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light and e be size of the discrete energy gap these be call 'emission line spectrum from the spectral pattern they produce when examine use a spectrometer a spectrometer produce this spectrum by collimate a thin sliver of light from the source use either a lens or mirror and then passing the re-sulting beam through either a grate to diffract it or a prism to refract it each wavelength in the beam will diffract or refract at a different angle thus produce a spectrum spectroscopy have be use for analysis in chemistry physic and astronomy all the way since the early 19th century when joseph von fraunhofer first use a diffraction grate to produce a spectrum of the sun 's visible light which appear a a continuous spectrum with thin dark gap in certain area these be later determine to be certain element in the sun 's corona absorb discrete wavelength of the sun 's radiation to excite their electron to high energy level thus reduce the intensity of the sun 's light at these wavelength -i.e the dark gap this investigation u a grate spectrometer the same concept a that originally developed by fraunhofer to measure the wavelength of spectral line in the balmer series emit by a hydrogen lamp these can then be use to deduce the rydberg constant a fundamental constant which relates the the spectral line of an emission spectrum to their wavelength niels bohr in his hypothesis for the model of an atom define the rydberg constant r ∞ in term of various fundamental physical constant where m e be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light h be planck 's constant and α be the fine structure constant -which be itself a combination of other fundamental constant maximum of an interference pattern occur when the phase difference between two ray be an integer multiple m of 2π the phase difference can also be express a the path difference of the two ray multiply by 2π λ where λ be the wavelength of the interfere ray 1 and since the path difference be just the slit separation d multiply by sinθ where θ be the angle of diffraction thus eliminate 2π here it can be see that sinθ be directly proportionate to m call the order number thus by measure the angle that the maximum appear at and know the slit separation of the diffraction grate the wavelength of the refract light can be determine the rydberg formula relates the transition wavelength λ of hydrogen to the integer n and p which represent the discrete energy level of the excite and relaxed state of the atom respectively the balmer series refers to the series of electron transition from an excite energy state of n 3 4 5 • • • ∞ to a relaxed state of p 2. the rydberg constant can then be calculate use the balmer transition wavelength value determine use the grate spectrometer the follow be a diagram of the path travel by the light in the spectrometer the emission from the source be pas through a narrow slit where a collimator convert the light into a parallel beam after then passing through the grate at normal incidence part of the diffract beam can be focus through a camera onto the center of a cross-hair x shape 1. the eyepiece lens be adjust to focus on the cross hair then the camera focus on a distant object -to imitate parallel light 2. the telescope be then set to be align with the axis of the collimator 0 • of angular displacement and the hydrogen lamp position in front of the slit so a to illuminate it 3. the focus of the collimator be adjust until the image of the slit on the cross hair be a sharp a possible and the telescope position so the slit be in alignment with the center of the cross hair 4. the grate be move through precisely 90 • and the grate place in the holder the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit be visible in the eyepiece -this indicates that the grate be at an angle of 45 • with the incident beam from the lamp and the telescope 5. the telescope be rotate through 45 • back to be in parallel with the incident beam on the grate 6. the angular displacement from this point to the diffract spectral line of red light be then record a a function of their order of magnitude the same be do for the set of diffract blue and violet spectral line from the linear regression analysis of the slope in figure 2 the standard error in the gradient of the slope be 0.000225 0.0012 0.00271 for the red blue and violet spectral line respectively these along with the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate can be use to calculate the overall error in the value obtain for the rydberg constant here be an example calculation for the 'red line set of data the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate be take a ±2 a state by the manufacturer thus d slope slope 0.000225 0.0522 0.00431 6 therefore the value determine for the rydberg constant via the 'red line data be 1.10 ± 0.02 × 10 7 m −1 the same process apply to the 'blue and 'violet data set give rydberg constant value of 1.10 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 1.09 ± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 these result be notably accurate the calculate error in each obtain value account for the difference between the calculate value and the real know value of 1.097 × 10 7 for the 'red set of data the error in the diffraction grate turn out to be the most significant source of uncertainty whereas for the 'blue and 'violet spectral line data the error in the slope be found to be high than the diffraction grate uncertainty these two data set have a high standard error could be due to a different hydrogen lamp be use for them a the first lamp blew while we be take data the hydrogen lamp be also move slightly during the measure of the blue line data which could have very slightly affected the path of the beam through the slit into the camera this could have be improve by use clamp to secure the lamp and spectrometer tightly to the worktop only duplicate reading be take for the angular displacement reading the precision of the data point could have be improve by increase this to at least 4 repeat measurement of the data set the three obtain value for the rydberg constant via this diffraction grate experiment be 1.10 ± 0.02 × 10 7 1.10 ± 0.04 × 10 7 and 1.09 ± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 this method have thus be an effective mean to determine the value of the rydberg constant a the widely accepted correct value of the constant 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 lie within the range each calculate value 's error margin in order to reduce the level of uncertainty in the future the experiment should be carry out with the hydrogen lamp and grate spectrometer clamped into place in order to prevent any off-balancing knock and another few set of reading would have be ideal to increase the reliability of the data gather\"\n"," 'in this paper i will present the method and result for an experiment with a grate spectrometer the purpose be to calculate a value of the rydberg constant by shin a hydrogen lamp through a grate spectrometer by measure the diffraction angle with the spectrometer the transition wavelength for hydrogen can be calculate with the wavelength and the transition level it be possible to calculate the rydberg constant and it uncertainty to get sufficient amount of statistical data we measure several transition from the balmer series from the transition 3→2 and 4→2 we get an average value for the rydberg constant 𝑹 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 a difference of 3.6 from the accepted value he motive for this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ from the balmer series for hydrogen the experimental method in the laboratory be base on a grate spectrometer use a hydrogen lamp a light source hot or electrically excite gas emit photon in which the emission be concentrate at a few well define wavelengths-called `` emission line spectrum `` our light source u hydrogen gas which by an electrical current through the gas excites photon at specific wavelength four of these wavelength be in the visible spectrum and can be measure with the spectrometer this device u a lens to produce a collimate beam of light make of several distinct wavelength which be disperse with a grate and split into it component wavelength with each separate wavelength head in different direction determine by the relationship the disperse light beam be then focus and view with an eyepiece in this way the various wavelength can be determine by measure the angle at which the light beam be disperse the balmer series for hydrogen represent a series of energy level for orbital electron when an electron make a transition from an initial state of high energy to a state of low energy the atom emits a photon of energy if we know the energy level and the correspond wavelength the rydberg constant can be calculate a diagram of the grate spectrometer use in this experiment be show in figure 1. the grate behaves like a multi-slit aperture with many closely space slit with a separation between adjacent slit of d. the light beam be diffract by the grate at an angle θ thus for neighbour light beam the path difference be d sin θ a show in the inset in fig 1 the light beam will interfere constructively only if the path difference be an integer number of wavelength where m be call the order number the ray from all slit will interfere constructively at the angle where m be an integer produce a principal maximum in that direction transition wavelength for hydrogen be give by the rydberg formula where n and p be integer which represent the energy level of the initial and final state for transition in the atom respectively 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant which have the accepted value 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 these transition be illustrate in fig 2. to set up the spectrometer we use a sodium lamp since it provide a stable light source without go warm the spectrometer use in the experiment consist of a collimator grate camera lens and eyepiece mount on a rotatable foundation a show in fig 3. the angle of the telescope camera lens and eyepiece relative to the collimator can be read with a vernier scale an illustration sketch of the spectrometer source http //spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys273/manual/diffract.html first we focus the eyepiece on the cross wire and the camera lens such that an object 10 m away be focus on the cross wire furthermore we align the telescope with the axis of the collimator with the sodium lamp close to the slit the collimator be focus on the slit to get the grate accurately parallel to the collimate beam the follow procedure be follow the telescope be rotate 90 deg and clamped in position place a grate with 78.8 line per mm in the holder turn the grate table until a reflect image of the entrance slit be see in the eyepiece with the vernier scale the grate be rotate 45 deg so that it be parallel to the collimate beam with the setup we could see 3 distinct spectral line for hydrogen with the red a the brightest light blue aqua slightly dimmer and violet not a bright since red and light blue be easy to measure accurately we focus on measure them in our experiment the slit width be measure to 0.07 deg at the 0 order for the red line we start from order -7 and move to order 5 reading the vernier scale at every order for the light blue line we measure order -9 -8 -7 0 3 4 5 and 6 since the measurement at the high order give more accurate reading and it save time the uncertainty of reading the vernier scale be estimate to 0.03 deg the data for the red emission line be show in fig 4. use the line fit we can calculate the wavelength with equation 1 obtain the wavelength 𝜆 694 ± 3 10 −9 𝑚. from the accepted value of the balmer series the transition 3→2 give red light at a wavelength 656 10 −9 𝑚. since this be the low energy level in the visible spectrum we can conclude that this be the transition we measure to calculate the rydberg constant we use our measure wavelength in equation 2 where n 3 and p 2. the result be the value 𝑅 ∞ 1.037 ± 0.014 10 7 𝑚 −1 the same procedure can be apply to the measurement of light blue aqua see fig 5 for data which yield the wavelength 𝜆 492 ± 0.2 10 −9 𝑚. from the accepted value of the balmer series the transition 4→2 give aqua light at a wavelength 486 10 −9 𝑚. this be very close to our measure value relative to the neighbour transition thus we can conclude that this be the transition we measure in the same manner the rydberg constant can be calculate but with n 4 and p 2. give the value 𝑅 ∞ 1.084 ± 0.014 10 7 𝑚 −1 combine the value we get the mean rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 with a percentage uncertainty of 1.9 the large error be from the measure value for the red emission line a potential source for this could stem from a difference in the setup since the red emission line be do in the first lab session and the aqua line in the second it be therefore possible that there be a difference in the setup such a the grate not be perfectly align for the aqua light we be able to measure order -9 and 6 which give a more accurate measurement of the wavelength furthermore there be a systematic error related to the reading of the vernier scale which have an estimate error of 0.03 deg in addition the light pollution in the laboratory mainly from other desk lamp make the reading harder another source of systematic error be the hydrogen lamp which contains small quantity of other material this effect be neglect a small since we do not see any other bright emission line the uncertainty can also be a result random error which can be reduce by take more measurement this be not do due to the long setup and time set of to the other part of the experiment the result of 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 be relative close to the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ 1.09737316 10 7 𝑚 −1 this suggests that our experiment agrees with the theory and the accepted value of the rydberg constant however there be a difference in the value and an associate uncertainty a review of the method of the experiment be therefore important in this experiment the set up have a substantial impact on how easy and accurate the measurement be we felt that our setup give well result in the second session where we measure the aqua light since we be able to see high order and get more consistent data this uncertainty could have be avoid by use the same setup but this be not possible due to time shortage in the first session on the same manner with more time we would be able to get more measurement which would reduce our random error furthermore a potential solution to minimize the systematic error be to use a ccd camera to find the principal maximum emission line and a magnetic sensor to measure the angle that the spectrometer be rotate at the aim of the experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant from the balmer series for hydrogen the experimental method be base on a grate spectrometer use a hydrogen lamp a light source through this method we obtain the result of 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 and a percentage uncertainty of 1.9 compare to the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ 1.09737316 10 7 𝑚 −1 our result be relative good at a percentage difference of 3.6 however the uncertainty of 1.9 could have be reduce by minimize our systematic error and reduce the random error by take more measurement some of the important factor with the experiment be the setup of the spectrometer and take consistently accurate measurement with the eyepiece and the vernier scale a potential solution to minimize this systematic error be to digitalize the measurement of the emission line and diffraction angle the spectrometer enables u to highly accurate measure spectrum and line of light it be widely use in science astrophysics and engineering and it find have help u explain the element of faraway object the gaseous layer of space and even the composition of the universe'\n"," \"the rydberg constant be calculate by observe the balmer series of hydrogen a hydrogen lamp be observe through a grate spectrometer upon which the wavelength of the colour observe be measure use which the rydberg constant could be calculate only the first 2 balmer line hα and hβ be intense enough to be observe and the rydberg constant be separately calculate for each with the hα line the rydberg constant be calculate to be 1.094×10 7 ± 0.2423 m -1 the theoretical value of 1.097×10 7 refer to 'theory section for derivation of theoretical value do not lie in the error range although the calculate value be off only

calculate produce when an electron transit from a high orbital to a low one in a hydrogen or a hydrogen like atom the rydberg constant be calculate theoretically use simultaneous equation of electrostatic attraction and the quantisation of the angular momentum of an electron the grate spectrometer be use in this experiment a grate spectrometer u a lens or mirror to form a collimate beam of light from a source and then disperse it with a grate it be use for produce spectral line from a light source and measure their intensity and wavelength hot or electrically excite gas emit spectrum concentrate at a few wavelength in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to observe a hydrogen lamp and calculate the wavelength of the spectral line observe for simplicity only the balmer series be analyse a they lie in the visible spectrum only two spectral line be observe the two line be red and blue with the red line be more intense hence we deduce that the red line be hα 3 to 2 and the blue line be hβ 4 to 2 a the former be more probable than the other and the remain balmer line be not intense enough to be observe a their transition be very improbable 1 use this data the rydberg constant can be calculate for each balmer line observe a grate be a large number of slit equally space separate by a distance d. light passing through a grate hence undergoes diffraction for a light of wavelength 𝜆 a principal maximum occurs when phase difference between two ray be an integral multiple n of 2π 2 in the case of 2 neighbour beam from the figure one see that the path difference be dsinө hence the spectrometer be use to measure different value sinө correspond to their respective value of n. the value of d depends on the grate use hence use the data from the spectrometer and equation a the wavelength of light can be calculate the grate constant n implies that there be n number of slit per unit length hence the distance between each slit be the inverse of the grate constant the wavelength can then be substitute into the rydberg formula state in the 'theory section and the rydberg constant can be calculate one must deduce the value of n and p for the various balmer line observe base on their relative intensity the improbability of a transition be proportional to how large the transition be hence reduce the intensity of light observe a the transition get high upon my lab partner and i take two individual reading for every fringe the maximum difference between our reading be 3 minute 0.05 degree hence error in the angle measurement be 0.05 degree the value of angle in degree be know to 4 significant digit hence all value will be write upto 4 significant digit with the error in angle ө be know we can calculate the error associate with sinө use the

which the wavelength of the balmer line observe be measure use which the rydberg constant could be estimate the experiment be a success in that the calculate value of rydberg constant be inaccurate only by 0.28 but the theoretical value do not lie in the error range of the calculate value this experiment be very useful and important because it taught u to use a spectrometer which be a very important instrument and have a wide number of u in various field it be also one of the most accurate instrument in the laboratory this experiment could be improve if the telescope have a high resolve power so the crosshair can be place more accurately by reduce ambient light the slit can be small in size thereby make measurement more accurate\"\n"," \"the rydberg constant symbol r∞ be measure use a grate spectrometer with a hydrogen lamp use a a source the wavelength of visible light emit by the hydrogen lamp be determine use simple diffraction grate theory which allow the value for r∞ to be determine use the rydberg formula for hydrogen specifically the formula pertain to the balmer series in hydrogen this result in a value of 11050000 ± 30000 m −1 which corresponds to a fractional uncertainty of about 3 part per thousand i n this experiment a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the emission spectrum of hydrogen be due to atom transition between atomic energy level and can be broken down into distinct spectral series one of which be the balmer series the balmer series pertains to transition to the 2nd energy level from high energy level and be of interest since it also involves emission of wavelength within the visible spectrum the wavelength in the balmer series be determine by examine the diffraction of the wavelength due to the grate then by use the rydberg formula which relates the wavelength of photon emit and the energy level involve in the transition a value for the rydberg constant can therefore be obtain for a diffraction grate where m be an integer call the order number λ be the wavelength of the light passing through the grate d be the slit separation and θ be the angle between the diffract ray and the grate 's normal vector in the bohr model of the atom electron orbit a positively charge nucleus where the electron can transition between stable circular orbit of different energy call energy level an atom can radiate energy in the form of a photon by an electron transition down from one energy level with energy to another with a low energy 1 p. 1318 for hydrogen-like atom which only have one electron the transition wavelength of the photon emit be give by the rydberg formula in the case of hydrogen and the balmer series z 2 and n 1 2 so equation 2 becomes the balmer formula where n 2 have be replace with n. the rydberg constant can be express a where α be the fine structure constant m e be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be planck 's constant use this result in a predict value for r ∞ of about 10973731.6 m −1 this value can be insert into equation 3 along with select value of n where n 2 and be an integer to predict what wavelength be emit in the balmer series and their colour table 1 above show these iii experimental method the grate spectrometer be set up a show in fig 1 and calibrate with a sodium lamp a the light source and a grate with a space of 2001 line per inch a sodium lamp be use for calibration instead of a hydrogen lamp since the calibration require that the light source be switch on continuously for a period of time which would cause the hydrogen lamp to overheat have it be use after calibration the sodium lamp be switch with a hydrogen lamp when first view the emission spectrum it be observe that the visible spectral line be red aqua and blue correspond to n 3 4 and 5 respectively in the balmer series violet line correspond to n 6 be visible but extremely faint therefore it be decide to collect data on only red aqua and blue line since it be thought that attempt to collect data on the violet line would be too time consume angle measurement be take one colour at a time begin with red then aqua and lastly blue since keep the hydrogen lamp for too long would cause it to overheat we take reading in time period 15 minute long and allow it to cool for 10 minute before take more reading the grate spectrometer be mount on a vernier scale which measure angle to the near arcminute or one-sixtieth of a degree the scale be very difficult to read so a magnify glass be use to assist in this the angle at the zeroth order/central maximum be measure for red line after which the telescope the camera and eyepiece would be turn until the next red line be encounter which then would be the angle at the first order maximum this would continue until no more red line would be visible at which point the telescope would be move back to the central maximum and the same process would be carry out in the other direction this time with the angle correspond a negative order this process would also be carry out for the aqua and blue line base on equation 1 it can be see that by plot sin θ against m for line of a certain colour where θ would be the difference between the angle at central maximum and the angle at a certain order m a linear graph would be obtain where it gradient would be equal to λ d this mean that the wavelength of the light can be determine by multiply the gradient by the slit separation d. figure 2 be a plot of sin θ against order m for red aqua and blue line the gradient with their associate error of these line be 0.05197 83 0.0385 27 and 0.03422 92 respectively multiply by slit separation d of about 1.27 × 10 −5 m −1 we obtain the wavelength λ red 660 ± 1 nm λ aqua 488 ± 3 nm λ blue 434 ± 1 nm compare these wavelength to the predict value in table 1 indicate that the red line in the balmer series very likely represent the transition of an electron from n 3 the aqua line from n 4 and the violet line from n 5. would result in a linear graph with a gradient of r ∞ the rydberg constant fig 3 λ and it gradient be equal to 11050000 ± 30000 m −1 therefore we have obtain the final value with uncertainty for the rydberg constant this represent a fractional uncertainty of 3 part per thousand in comparison with the 2014 codata recommend value of 10973731.568508 65 m −1 2 our obtain value be within 0.7 percent but the recommend value do not fall within the experimental error bound this likely indicates that some source of error have not be take into account it take a long time for the grate spectrometer to be calibrate which be hamper by the spectral line gradually move below or above the line of sight of the telescope a θ increase this implies that there be a slant in some part of the grate spectrometer a a result only six reading be able to be take for each colour if more reading be take the error obtain could have be less moreover some systematic error be likely to have be introduce a a result of this misalignment another potential source for error from within the apparatus be if the grate and collimator or the camera and eyepiece be not perfectly parallel to the other this would result in deviation of the angle measure thereby contribute to the error the absolute error use for θ in the error analysis be ±1 arcminute since the vernier scale have an absolute error of ±0.5 arcminute and θ represent the difference between two reading despite this when take a reading from the vernier scale it be often difficult to decide which point on the vernier scale aligns with the main scale so the absolute error be probably underestimated the air density may be important since air can cause light to refract although over a short distance a in the spectrometer any error it contributes should be negligible in this report we examine the balmer series for hydrogen and present an experimentally obtain value for the rydberg constant which be reasonably close to the accepted value despited that the fractional uncertainty of three part per thousand be ten time the theoretical precision of three part per ten thousand for a grate spectrometer which be partly due to misalignment of the spectrometer moreover the accepted value be n't within the error bound obtain far indication that there be source of error not take into account or otherwise underestimated this experiment could be improve if the alignment of the spectrometer be improve a well a by take more reading\"\n"," \"through method of spectroscopy we be able to calculate a value for the rydberg constant a constant that be use when calculate the wavelength of emit light from hydrogen atom and more specifically the wavelength from the balmer series the balmer series that we measure be the photon from electron that have de-excited from a high energy level to the second energy level of a hydrogen atom a a result our procedure be to use a hydrogen source and for the light to be diffract through a grate the light from the diffraction grate be then measure and for the wavelength to be calculate from their respective angle by calculate the wavelength of the light we be able to produce a value for the rydberg constant 1.69562 × 10 6 m -1 ± 3.13799 × 10 5 m -1 the true value of the rydberg constant however be 1.0973731568508 × 10 7 m -1 1 this constant be useful when investigate the bohr model 2 for atom and so provide a great initial investigation into the structure of atom at a more fundamental level n order to calculate a value for the rydberg constant we have to use a new technique to measure the wavelength of the emit light from the hydrogen source spectroscopy furthermore through this experiment we be able to look at the behaviour of light through a diffraction grate and how the component of the light emit be able to provide detail of the source and thus the structure of hydrogen atom to complete this experiment and to understand the implication of such an experiment the theoretical background must be understood since there be an equation relate the number of slit per unit length in the diffraction grate and the wavelength of the light through the grate the different wavelength be produce at vary angle additionally since there be an equation relate wavelength and the rydberg constant these measurement that we be able to take allow for this constant to be calculate we use a spectrometer for this experiment and by use a hydrogen lamp the correct measurement be take also due to the way in which the hydrogen lamp depletes so quickly the sodium lamp be use for the initial calibration this experiment involve use a vernier scale and so it be of vital importance to measure the value accurately especially when consider some of the value be of such a small value and difference the balmer series be of great importance to research and so understand this characteristic of light from a hydrogen source have implication on research be conduct at the moment the abundance of hydrogen within the universe also make this series vitally important when it come to the classification of star and other cosmological object 3 the nature of light allows for certain prediction to be make when light interacts with an obstacle and thus due to this predictability the characteristic of a light source can be measure the grate itself be compose of equally space slit of which there be a large number n and with each slit separate by a distance d. the light then pas through each slit for it then to interfere with light from other slit within the grate the way in which light interferes with other wave involves the phase difference 𝜙 of the light during it interaction with other wave this cause superposition between the wave and thus determines at which angle there be maximum and minimum this phase difference can then be show through these equation where 𝜆 be the wavelength of light emit from the source m be the order number and 𝜃 be the angle of the light from the normal to the diffraction grate consequently with vary wavelength be emit from the transition of electron to the second energy level the angle will vary and so the different wavelength can be detect to ensure however that each line could be detect consider a second wavelength λ. a a result a relationship between the two wavelength can be show through these two equation where δ𝜆 be the difference between the two wavelength 𝜆 and λ. the condition of this value for this equation be such that δ𝜆 ≪ 𝜆. therefore from this equation it reveals how the resolution of the image be dependent upon n the number of slit in the diffraction grate a a result of these equation we be able to show that through the method of spectroscopy it be possible to observe the different wavelength of light at vary angle from the normal to the diffraction grate these different wavelength be be emit from a hydrogen atom and can be related between the initial and final energy state of the atom this be due to the way in which the great the energy transition the shorter the wavelength this relationship be from these equation and definition where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 3 n be the initial state and p be the final state with both be integer α the fine structure constant 4 𝑚 𝑒 the mass of the electron h the planck 's constant e the charger of an electron and 𝜀 0 the permittivity of free space for the balmer series that we observe the final state be the hydrogen atom 's second energy state and so the value of p would be 2 in equation 2 be the x-axis from this the gradient can be calculate therefore to calculate a value for the rydberg constant it would be to calculate the gradient of the line produce from our data and thereby determine a value for the rydberg constant in order to complete this experiment the setup of the spectrometer must be complete so a to ensure that all the measurement take be accurate in addition due to the extreme sensitivity of the experiment and the small value that we dealt with the setup of this experiment be vital to the success of the experiment for this experiment it be important to get a many data point a possible so a to ensure that the value we end with be reliable and accurate also due to the way in which our setup be design the hydrogen lamp have a limited amount of usage to overcome this problem a sodium lamp be use to calibrate and setup the spectrometer due to the way in which the calibration only require the zeroth order from the diffraction grate which be the same regardless of the source use so a to focus the eyepiece that we use we focus the eyepiece on the cross wire this guaranteed that each measurement we take be from a precise point that could be see clearly by ourselves if it be to be a blur image of the cross wire it would be difficult to determine from which point we take the measurement and if we be n't able to take the measurement from the same point of the strip it would make each measurement unfairly measure when compare to the other measurement we take to then focus the lens of the eye piece we align the telescope of the spectrometer onto a distant object approximately 5 to 10 metre from the telescope this allows for a clear image to be see when measure the spectral line however such focus allows for a minimal parallax between the spectral line that we be measure and the cross wire within the telescope follow the previous process we have to ensure that the collimator within the spectrometer have be properly focus a a result by put the sodium lamp in front of slit and the telescope align with single spectral line produce since there 's no grate the collimator lens should be focus to make the image of the spectral line a clear and sharp image this allows for clear measurement of the spectral line to be take due to the ability of the cross wire to precisely line up with the centre of the spectral line to ensure that the spectrometer be setup correctly it be vital to ensure that certain screw of the spectrometer be left alone and thus make it easy for accurate measurement to be take and for the spectrometer to be secure in place 5 for the set up of the spectrometer we record the initial value of the telescope 's angle when with no grate a single spectral line be see and we then move the telescope through by 90 degree we then place the grate into the holder on the grate table and move the table round until we could see the reflection of the spectral line in the eyepiece of the telescope we then adjust the height of the table to allow for the whole spectral line to be see fully the value of the angle at this point be then record and we then move the grate table back through 45 degree for it to then be normal to the incident ray on the diffraction grate the spectrometer we use can be see in the image below 6 after use the sodium lamp for the calibration we use the hydrogen lamp so a to collect the appropriate data from the balmer series we also kept move the hydrogen lamp 's position in front of the slit to try and allow for a much light a possible thus make it easy for u to collect reading when collect the data we try to eliminate a much background light a possible to ensure that we be not see incorrect reading furthermore due to similar experiment with similar setup be conduct within close proximity of our own experiment we decide to ensure that we block each light with black card this be important because since the telescope would move round to detect the image 3.1 this be a photo of the spectrometer use in this experiment and a can be see at the centre of the image the grate table that held the grate table be place the screw underneath the grate table control the height of the table however a screw behind the telescope the right side 's eyepiece telescope allows for small movement to be take the slow motion drive the screw either side of each telescope focus the lens of their respective telescope and the screw underneath the telescope keep the scale in place spectral line it become important to block these other source of light that may have come into view for this experiment we measure the angle from the centre of the spectral line for each colour and we continued to move through the order until the intensity of the light be too dark to be able to determine it colour however it be important to try and measure a many different colour and consequently wavelength a possible from this the aim be to try and produce a more accurate gradient and then from this a well value for the rydberg constant furthermore after align the telescope but before we take our reading we have to turn off the hydrogen lamp to guarantee the lamp would n't deplete and thus allow for more reading to be take during our laboratory session the specific setup that we use to measure the order of the different wavelength can be see in the diagram below and use this setup a spectrometer can be use so a to collect accurate data for the experiment the data that we collect for each colour can be see in the figure below and with each of these data point have an associate error that be carry through in the final calculation we repeat measurement for the aqua because it appear at the time that we have carry out our measurement incorrectly the true value can be show below 7 from this data it show that the blue data we collect be inaccurate in term of it closeness to the actual value despite the error be extremely large this be due to the diagram 3.1 this be the diagram of the experimental setup that we use the first lens the ray interact with be from the collimator with the blue dot line act a the diffraction grate the second lens then act a the camera with the third eyepiece belonging to the eye piece from this setup we be able to measure the angle of the light from the diffraction grate error be small in term of each initial measurement however when carry through in term of the error of the end result a large error be produce this disparity may have be a a result of inaccurate measurement because when measure the angle we may have misalign the cross wire over the line and so incorrect measurement in addition since we complete these measurement in a separate session the calibration of the spectrometer may have be incorrect and thus cause the disparity between the value on the other hand the data we collect for the red and aqua spectral line be near real value and hence accurate measurement since the real value fell within the error of each data set the rydberg constant can therefore be calculate and be show in the graph below however when look at the graph it be clear to see that there be an anomaly the furthest left data point it be know that this be the anomalous data point because the line need to have a negative gradient this far emphasis the inaccuracy of the blue spectral line data and the need to have collect more data however more importantly to have the spectrometer correctly calibrate this be evident because if the anomalous data be remove the gradient would change and from this a value for the rydberg constant be found 𝑅 ∞ 9.891682 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 ± 3.69817 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 and this value be much closer to the real value and although it do not have the real value within the error bar it be significantly closer to the real value a a result have more data set for other wavelength would have produce a more accurate value of the rydberg constant the aim of this experiment be to gain a value for the rydberg constant which be achieve however unless you remove the anomaly from the data we collect an inaccurate value be produce additionally due to two data point have much well accuracy and precision it reveals how when conduct the second set of experiment for the blue spectral line the spectrometer be setup incorrectly this experiment also provide u with the ability to use and understand this new technique of spectroscopy this be important because it also provide the platform to conduct far experiment in the future when conduct far experiment in other area of physic the theory of this experiment give the background to this experiment and thus allow for certain measurement to be take to allow for characteristic of a hydrogen atom to be measure and understood this balmer series be still important to modern research and so to understand it origin be important the success of this experiment be limited however because due to the inaccuracy and disparity of some of the data point the rydberg constant 's value come out to be inaccurate in comparison to the desire value nonetheless if these data point be remove an accurate result would be found the failure of this experiment be in these inaccurate data point and so to improve certain step can be take to improve accuracy for example the error could have be calculate by measure either side of the spectral line and so the error be half the range of these two value and then the standard error be calculate from all the value we measure in addition we could have take more repeat thereby produce more reliable data and thus make it easy to find the correct value a darker environment could have be make and hence reduce disturbance from the background however the main improvement would be to have spent more time on the setup of the spectrometer this improvement guarantee that there be more accuracy for each data point a well a precision because it reduces the possibility of there be an original offset that then make all value measure incorrect this experiment allow u to achieve certain goal in term of data collection and accuracy however from this experiment we be able to see the way in which the rydberg constant relates to physical attribute in the hydrogen atom and a a result learn more about the bohr model of the atom and the implication this have within the structure of an atom\"\n"," \"the follow paper explores how an optical diffraction-grating spectrometer which investigate visible spectral line of the hydrogen balmer series be use to determine rydberg 's constant use the precise set-up equipment reliable measurement of spectral line for several order of diffraction be obtain both red and blue spectral line be independently measure and investigate to estimate a value of rydberg 's constant these value be then compare with the accepted theoretical value from quantum mechanic graphical and computational analysis be then use to determine the estimate value for rydberg 's constant the observe red and blue spectral line produce a value of 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 respectively when compare to the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 the respective percentage error produce for rydberg 's constant be 0.38 and 2.67 the importance of investigate the hydrogen balmer series and subsequently determine the rydberg constant to high precision be most relevant in astronomy this be partly because hydrogen be the most abundant element in the universe 1 thus when study celestial body such a star measurement can then be use to identify that specific hydrogen process such a that cause the hydrogen balmer series be take place the importance of this experiment therefore stem from be able to well understand sub-atomic process which we observe and use every day in physic the various spectrum which have be observe be what lead to the study of atomic physic and quantum mechanic 1 the experimental value obtain in this experiment can therefore be compare with the accepted theoretical value for rydberg 's constant hence this could check the validity of the accepted value and be use to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the experimental procedure hence this could lead to a method of find way to improve the accuracy and resolution obtain when take astronomical reading the various series create be due to emission and absorption process in atom which create sequence such a the balmer and lyman series in hydrogen these series result from electron in the hydrogen atom transition from high state of quantum number to stable quantum state n 2 and n 1 respectively 1 due to spontaneous emission these transition reduce the electron energy by discreate amount which cause monoenergetic photon to be emit with discreate wavelength the underlie physic process take place in this experiment be the emission of monoenergetic packet of light due to orbital electron transition which follow the hydrogen balmer series and diffraction here a hydrogen lamp act a the light source and a diffraction grate spectrometer be then use to diffract the light use these instrument the monochromatic wavelength of light emit in the hydrogen balmer series for different electron transition be found this allow u to estimate a value for the rydberg constant use the rydberg equation the hydrogen lamp emits light by heating the hydrogen gas 2 which cause hydrogen atom to become excite a an orbital electron transition to a high quantum state consequently the electron shortly spontaneously emits back to the original stable quantum state during this electronic transition a light photon of monochromatic wavelength be emit because of the transition between monoenergetic level use a spectrometer to determine rydberg 's constant by investigate the hydrogen balmer series these light wave of single wavelength then diffract through a diffraction grate to create an inte1ference pattern on a screen due to the superposition of diffract light wave the theo1y of these process be described far in section ii the rest of this repo1t will describe fuither the experimental and theoretical method use to detennine rydberg 's constant and then draw conclusion from those find the discreate energy of a photon spontaneously emit by a hydrogen atom in the balmer series be give by where his planck 's constant and f be the frequency of the photon emit in the balmer series this energy be lose by the hydrogen atom a an orbital electron in an excite quantum state spontaneously de-excites to quantum state n 2. thus the energy of the monoenergetic photon emit be equal to the energy difference between the two quantum state where e1 be the initial energy of the hydrogen atom and ei be the final energy the monochromatic wavelength of light emit by the hydrogen atom in the balmer series give by 3 where c be the speed of light in a vacuum can be found by equate i and 2 to obtain .. he/ ei-ei 4 balmer also developed a fo1mula in 1885 to measure the wavelength .. of the balmer series where n be integer 1 2 3 ... and c be the balmer constant rydberg generalize this in 1889 for the entire emission spectrnm of hydrogen a where r be the rydberg constant nf be the final quantum state and ni be the initial quantum state where nf= 2 for the hydrogen balmer series l when the monochromatic wavelength light wave reach the diffraction grate the interference pattern produce contain spectral line maximum position from where the wave constrnctively superpose and inte1fere the phase difference between successive maximum be therefore 2ijc thus d sin e ma 7 where d be the slit separation 0 be the angle of diffraction and m be the order of diffraction in the expe1iment equation 7 be use to find the s. ingle wavelength emit in the hydrogen balmer series for red ni 3 and blue ni 4 light then equation 6 be use to dete1mine the estimate value for rydberg 's constant the experimental method use be able to significantly reduce many systematic and random enors effect on the experiment which be obse1ved this result in obtain a precise and accurate methodology which be a reproducible and reliable method for estimate rydberg 's constant accurate technique include computational analysis be then use to obtain the estimate value for rydberg 's constant and their associate e1rnrs the diffraction grate space be dete1mined use the provide number of line per unit length from the manufacturer 2 this info1mation give an approximate value of 12.7 x 10-0 m for the slit separation a similar slit separation be need for this experiment to obse1ve many order of diffraction since the range of wavelength for electro-magnetic wave in the visible light region be approximately 390 nm -700 nm a pasco student spectrometer such a in figure 1 be use to diffract the monoenergetic light emit by the hydrogen lamp and to obse1ve the spectral emission line produce eyepiece 3 to show how a spectrometer work when light be incident on it from the slit and how it can be use to find the wavelength of the light 2 a show in figure 2 the spectrometer which be use have a collimator and slit which cause the incoming light photon from the hydrogen lamp to become a parallel beam then the grate be use to diffract accord to 7 the n01mal incidence beam into an interference pattern of spectral line which be finally focus and obse1ved a an image in the telescope which be compose of the camera and eyepiece 2 the spectrometer be set-up follow the instruction provide in the 'first year laborato1y manual 2017 -2018 2 key point in the methodology be a follow • we focus the eyepiece on the crosswire so that an image roughly 30 cm away could be optimally obse1ved with limited eye strain this reduce random enor a the specti•al line obse1ved be more well define through the eyepiece • then the camera lens be focus on a distant object roughly 10 m away where incoming light could be assume to be parallel so that there be no parallax enor between the cross wire and image this reduce the random e1rnr due to human obse1vation associate significantly • then we align the collimator and telescope turn on and place the hydrogen lamp in an optimal position to the collimator slit then focus the collimator to see the slit image more sharply • after we move the telescope through 90 degree and inse1t ed the grate into the holder this meant the collimator and eyepiece be pe1pendicular then turn the grate table until there be an image of the slit in the eyepiece this meant that the grate table be at 45 degree to the incident beam from the collimator this be because the incident light be be reflect off the grate • at this point in the set-up there be a significant systematic enor with the specti•ometer which may have be due to the manufacturer it be notice that the vernier scale reading do n't match the theoretically expect value by roughly a 10-degree offset this could n't be resolve but didn t have a bearing on the result obtain • finally the grate be position pe1pendicular to the incident light from the collimator which be align with the telescope this be do by rotate the grate by 45 degree a centi•al zero order fringe be see through the telescope when it be align with the collimator which indicate the spectrometer be align properly the vernier scale be use to accurately measure the angle of diffraction which the telescope obse1ved at maximum position at least 5 order of diffraction left and 1ight of the centi•al zeroth order fringe be use beyond which the line specti•a become less visible and bluned to dete1mine the angle of diffraction the measure angle at each order of diffraction be subti•acted from the measure angle at the centi•al fringe 8 where 0m be the angle measure by the vernier scale at each respective order of diffraction and 0c be the angle measure by the vernier scale at the centi•al zeroth order fringe this provide the necessary measurement need to dete1mine the wavelength of light emit from the hydrogen balmer series which be investigate use equation 7 and consequently estimate the value ofrydberg 's constant use equation 6 the effect of background light on the clru•ity of the spectral line obse1ved in the telescope be a systematic enor which be reduce in the experiment .. this be achieve by make the environment a dark a possible with baniers use to stop any light reflect towards the specti•ometer a these measure result in well-defined specti•al line it be assume that any systematic e1rnr from this source be neglible also another identify systematic enor be the width of specti•al line which if significantly wide would need to be measure use the vernier scale at each edge an average value could then be use in equation 8 to find the angle of diffraction however when this be do for the high order of diffraction use the measure angle on the vernier scale show that the width be too small for resolution of the vernier scale hence this systematic e1rnr be also ignore during the expe1iment a be assume to be neglible the lamp be also position relatively close to the collimator slit so that the intensity of the spectral line obse1ved in the eyepiece be more well define also the lamp be align with the collimator and grate so that the maximum amount of light would enter the collimator slit finally to reduce background light the inside of the hydrogen lamp have a black cover to stop any other light enter the collimate slit another systematic error encounter during the experiment be a spectrometer misalignment this be notice when the grate be position at 45 degree to the incident beam when the collimator slit and telescope be perpendicular to each other it be expect that the vernier scale would show 45 degree difference between both the collimator and telescope a the incident light be reflect off the grate however while these relative position in the spectrometer be correct the vernier scale read a value which be 3.90 degree off the expect theoretical value this may have be a problem with the manufacturer a another spectrometer of the same type show a similar misalignment when be set-up however a this be a systematic error which do n't affect the angle of diffraction when the spectrometer be set-up this have no bearing on the calculation of rydberg 's constant thus the systematic error involve be ignore the misalignment of the spectrometer have no affect on the measure angle of diffraction because when use equation 8 the measure position θ m and θ c be relative to only each other the main source of random error which be introduce in the experiment be when take measurement of the angle diffract by line spectrum use the vernier scale while the vernier scale be highly precise the main random error associate with the measure equipment be the resolution of the vernier scale which be estimate to be 0.05 degree this random error be estimate by judging how many division on the vernier scale appear to be also correct and then halve this range which be the estimate random error use for this the actual resolution in angle which the vernier scale can measure of 0.017 degree be not use for this estimation because of human error limit the resolution of the method far than the equipment use when visually observe the vernier scale it be apparent that there be no clear and correct mark to use thus it be estimate that 6 mark on the vernier scale appear to be the possible correct mark the estimate error of 0.05 degree be then found by calculate the angle cover by half of those division the other main random error associate with this method of measure be human error due to incorrectly reading the vernier scale poor judgment to approximate this random error two observer independently measure the angle of diffraction the mean value be calculate a the average of the two reading the standard error be then calculate and use a the associate estimate of this random error finally to estimate the combine random error associate with each angle of diffraction the approximate random error be add to get the combine estimate error associate with each angle measure on the vernier scale then a the angle of diffraction be calculate use equation 8 the estimate random error of each respective angle measure θ m and θ c be add in quadrature a equation 7 be use to find the wavelength of light emit a part of the hydrogen balmer series the value and associate error of sin θ for each order of diffraction be found the value be found by inputting the angle of diffraction to find the associate error the follow formula be use where φ be the estimate error of each respective angle of diffraction this approximation for the error be use because φ be relatively small thus could assume that around θ the curve approach linearity this meant that the error above and below the value of sin θ be the same also since the value of θ be relatively small a small angle approximation also support this method of approximate the associate error use equation 7 to find the wavelength of light emit from the hydrogen balmer series meant a graph of sin θ against m the order of diffraction be use the slit separation d multiply by the gradient of the graph would hence provide the wavelength computational analysis be use to create and analyze these graph for blue and red light a show in figure 3 4 5 and 6. figure 5. the graph use to find the wavelength of red light use equation 7 it be clear that the method use be highly precise due to the clear linear relationship exhibit and the small deviation of point to the line of best fit also method of reduce systematic error appear to have be successful a there be a relatively small y-intercept this method provide wavelength of 473 ± 10.2 nm and 659 ± 0.761 nm for the blue and red light respectively however when this be compare to the actual value of 486 nm and 656 nm respectively 4 the estimate result for blue and red light do n't include the expect value in their estimate error this indicate that the associate random error may have be underestimated and some source of error may not have be identify and include in the experimental calculation use equation 6 and error calculation provide from source 2 the estimate value and associate error of rydberg 's constant for red light where the orbital electron spontaneously emits the red light from initial quantum state n i 3 and blue light where the orbital electron spontaneously emits the blue light from initial quantum state n i 4 be calculate the estimate value and associate error of rydberg 's constant be 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 for red light and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 for blue light compare to the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 the respective percentage error produce for rydberg 's constant be 0.38 and 2.67 however a the estimate value for the wavelength of blue and red light do n't include the expect value the estimate value for rydberg 's constant also do n't include the theoretical value the aim of this experiment be to determine the rydberg constant through investigate the hydrogen balmer series use a grate spectrometer this be achieve by use a pasco student spectrometer and hydrogen lamp the optical spectrometer be use to measure the angle of diffraction for multiple order for the red and blue light emit a part of the hydrogen balmer series graphical and computational analysis be then use to attain precise estimate value for rydberg 's constant the experiment provide estimate value for rydberg 's constant of 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 for red light and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 for blue light this be compare to the accepted theoretical value of rydberg 's constant of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 with red and blue light produce respective percentage error for rydberg 's constant of 0.38 and 2.67 the experiment be able to successfully reduce the main source of systematic error a show by the observe spectral line which be well define the misalignment of the spectrometer by 3.90 degree however be a systematic error which could n't be resolve during the experiment also the measurement take be highly accurate with the vernier scale be use to obtain high resolution reading and reduce human error significantly however the experiment do n't obtain estimate result which include the theoretical value of rydberg 's constant this indicate that the estimation of random error be n't a accurate a possible this may have be due to underestimate the random error associate with reading the vernier scale or it equati on of l ine of best f i t 0.05194 x 0.005208 ■ may have be a significant source of random error which be n't take into consideration to improve the experiment an align spectrometer should be use to repeat the method a the vernier scale may have be unprecise which be perceive a be misalign in the experiment which would be a significant random error which could n't be test for also a more sophisticated experimental set-up could be use such a a computer-aided spectrophotometer to obtain more accurate result this could also allow other wavelength of light from the hydrogen balmer series to be investigate once the experimental method be refine this would provide a highly accurate and precise method of determine rydberg 's constant\"\n"," 'the uncertainty in the measurement of each angle be estimate simply by take several reading of each maximum and compare them to find a range the uncertainty use for each data point be then half the total range which be found to be 1/6 of a degree source of systematic error be mostly not possible for u to measure in the time available so for example we do not obtain enough measurement of maximum to both side of the centre to compare them and as how much error may be arise from slight asymmetry in the alignment of the spectrometer instead the result here be base on measurement just to one side of the centre and this error can not be quantify similarly other potential source of error such a atmospheric condition affect the optical property of the air and therefore alter the wavelength due to a potential change in the speed of light be not account for a these condition i.e humidity air pressure be not measure when the experiment be be carry out furthermore a other work be be do in the lab variation in background light could not be avoid meaning some data point may have underestimated uncertainty if background light be high when the measurement be take specifically to the setup we use the spectrometer be balance on a table which do not perfectly sit flat on the table we attempt to prevent it wobble while we make our measurement by place some paper under one of the leg but this do not seem to fully remedy the problem so it may have create some random error if it be not in exactly the same position for all the measurement the result we be able to obtain include only two wavelength of the balmer series a low wavelength be not visible with the set up use the two correspond to n value of 3 for the red light and 4 for the blue violet light which we assume to correspond to n=5 be visible only to the first maximum and so we be unable to gather enough data point to calculate a precise value for it wavelength and other colour be not visible at all a show in fig 2 and 3 the data fit extremely well to a linear relationship a predict by our model this allow u to calculate value for the wavelength of 6614762x10 -13 +/-7x10 -13 m for the red light and 47739x10 -11 +/-1x10 -11 m for the blue use 2 the mean value of the rydberg constant obtain from 3 be 11028400+/-100m -1 this do not agree with the accepted value of 10973731.6m -1 which would suggest that systematic error in the experiment have a significant impact however consider the individual value for the two different colour the red light give a value approximately 1 low than the accepted value while the blue light give one approximately 2 high rather than support the idea that it be cause by systematic error it instead implies that the problem be that random error be underestimated the most likely candidate for this phenomenon be the unstable table on which the spectrometer be balance mention in section iii it would explain why the two data set show very little error within themselves and yet the two data set both conflict with both one another and the accepted value it be possible that other source of error played their part such a background light and atmospheric condition however it seem less likely that these would have give such a clear divide between the two data set the unstable table would be more likely a the data set be take very close together give limited time for such a distinct change in humidity or pressure also background light fluctuate throughout the experiment with no chance of give such a distinct contrast in the two set of reading another contribution to the error in our result be likely not accounting for possible asymmetry in our set up by only measure to one side of the centre it be possible that if we have do so we would have notice the effect of the unstable table and have a chance of quantify the resultant error instead we be left with no way of state with any certainty whether this or another unidentified source of error lead to the issue in our final value use our method we be able to obtain a value for the rydberg constant which fell within 1 of the accepted value however a we underestimated the systematic error inherent in our set up our value conflict with the accepted value despite be so close in order to make it a useful measurement we would need to return to the experiment and thoroughly investigate and quantify the impact of all potential source of systematic error described in section iii once this be do it would be possible to both more confidently state which source of error cause the issue in this experiment and to repeat the experiment with well control and understand of these error to obtain a more accurate value of the rydberg constant another improvement that could likely give a significant increase in the accuracy and precision achievable would be if extra wavelength could be observe to increase the amount of data available this could be achieve either by change the source to one in which low wavelength be brighter and could be measure another possibility be to use other method of observation than the naked eye allow infra-red ultra violet or both to be observe in addition once again this would simply increase the amount of data available to use in calculation thereby reduce statistical error and give a more precise final value'\n"," \"electron in an atom undergo transition in between energy level in the atom when these transition be from a high energy state to a low state the excess energy be emit in the form of a photon of a certain wavelength for this experiment we use a hydrogen discharge lamp and a spectrometer the transition emit photon in the visible region of the spectrum be grouped together into the balmer series the wavelength of these spectral line can be measure by use a spectrometer to measure the angular position of the line and plot this position against the order of the spectral line the product of the slope of this plot and the slit separation give u the wavelength the initial and final energy level can be

consider light of wavelength λ. for this beam of light a principal maximum due to diffraction occurs when the phase difference between neighbour ray be an integer multiple m of 2π the path difference between neighbour ray can be calculate from the figure see figure 3 it come out a thus use equation 1 2 and 3 we get which mean here m be call the order number λ be the wavelength and d be the separation between two adjacent slit light of a give colour will be diffract at a specific angle for a give order all light ray of that colour will be parallel if the incident light ray be parallel light of a different colour be diffract at a different angle but it light ray will also be parallel accord to the theory quantum mechanic an electron bound to an atom can not have any value of energy rather it can only occupy certain state which correspond to certain energy level the formula define the energy level of a hydrogen atom be give by the equation e -e0/n 2 where e0 13.6 ev 1 ev 1.602×10 -19 joule and n 1,2,3… and so on the energy be express a a negative number because it take that much energy to unbind ionize the electron from the nucleus when an electron absorbs a photon it gain the energy of the photon because an electron bound to an atom can only have certain energy the electron can only absorb photon of certain energy if a photon have more energy than the binding energy of the electron then the photon will free the electron from the atom -ionizing it the electron once it have absorbed photon be now in an excite state an electron have a certain probability to drop from one excite state to a low i.e more negative energy level when an electron drop from a high level to a low level it shed the excess energy a positive amount by emit a photon the transition be classify into

experiment be start the spectrometer must first be calibrate the initial step consist of focus the eyepiece on the cross wire such that the set be free of eye strain best do with both eye open next the camera lens be focus such that a distant object be focus onto the cross wire now the telescope be align with the collimator see figure 5 for the next part of calibration a sodium-vapour lamp be use the wavelength of the lamp be know to be an average of two line and be precisely 589.3nm this lamp be then place in front of the slit of the spectrometer the telescope be move through 90° and clamped and a grate be put in the holder this diffraction grate be one that have 80 lines/mm line per millimetre the grate be adjust to see a reflect image of the slit meaning the grate be at 45° with respect to the collimator beam once the image be centre on the cross wire the reading of the scale be note and the grate be rotate through precisely 45 degree thus set it at normal incidence the height of the image can also be adjust use the adjustment screw to centre it on the cross wire the spectrometer be now calibrate and set up to take measurement with a precision of under 0.3 or about ±0.2 nm for yellow-orange light 8 the aim of this part of the experiment be to use the spectrometer to measure the wavelength use the grate equation eqn 4 consider the angular separation of fringe from the central fringe to be θ. then measure θ for different value of m both positive and negative with the sign indicate the side of displacement left or right the width of the slit of the spectrometer can be adjust vary the intensity and hence the width of the observe spectral line refer to table 1 for measure value for both red and purple spectral line note the slit of the spectrometer be use be misalign cause the spectral line to be cut horizontally this however do not affect the measure process or the obtain value a the spectrometer be very precise and the hydrogen lamp be an emitter of pure wavelength single value or discreet table 1 from eqn 4 the grate use be 78.8 line per mm or 2001 line per inch thus give a value for 'd which be then use to calculate the wavelength of the light this be do for 3 different transitions-namely red blue and violet show below be the plot for the violet spectral line refer to appendix 2 for red spectral line 's data the wavelength of the line be then calculate use the gradient slope of the plot the error in the gradient and the slit separation d the wavelength of the red spectral line be calculate to be 678.9 ± 46.8 𝑛𝑚 and that of the violet spectral line be 443 ± 2.1 𝑛𝑚 now that the wavelength have be calculate it can be use to determine that value of rydberg 's constant each transition emits a discreet wavelength in the visible spectrum a show below in table 2 from the table the value of 𝑛 𝑓 and 𝑛 𝑖 be use a 𝑛 1 and 𝑛 2 from eqn 5 now the value of rydberg 's constant can be calculate use eqn 5 rearrange eqn 5 every observe spectral line have a certain angular spread when observe through the spectrometer this spread can be minimise by narrow the slit of the instrument for most visible line the slit can be kept narrow enough so the error be immeasurable with this apparatus but a you pan farther out the line be blur and can not be view with a narrow slit in these case the angular spread of the line be measure and that be use a a measure of the uncertainty in the measurement of the position of the line the uncertainty in table 1 be these very angular spread since these be measure for the furthest line observe the error be the maximum possible for the precede line also thus this have be accepted a the maximum possible error in each colour in equation 8 m and d be know and so the uncertainty in λ be directly related to the uncertainty in the position the error in the value of rydberg 's constant be simply the error in the inverse wavelength a the value in table 2 be know with certainty thus the error 𝜎 𝜃 be for red 𝜎 𝜃 1'48 `` and violet 𝜎 𝜃 3′ the error calculate for the red spectral line be 46.8 𝑛𝑚 and that for the violet spectral line be 2.1 𝑛𝑚 fri nge order 'm use the value of wavelength 𝑛 𝑖 𝑛 𝑓 and the error calculate a above rydberg 's constant be calculate to be the value of rydberg 's constant obtain from the experiment for red and violet spectral line be 1.061 ± 0.073 x10 7 m −1 and 1.061 ± 0.01 𝑥 10 7 𝑚 −1 respectively although these value do not coincide with the accepted value of rydberg 's constant which be 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 their uncertainty cover this value this uncertainty however may arise from several source both random and systematic one of the main cause of a random error be the overheat of the hydrogen lamp which may alter the data and increase uncertainty the change in pressure of the gas in the discharge tube could also contribute to random error a the gas pressure be increase the spike become broader this 'pressure broadening be a direct consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle and stem from the fact that a the pressure increase the gas molecule undergo more and more collision thus reduce the average time for which a molecule can remain in a give electronic state the heisenberg principle implies that a the lifetime of give state decrease it energy becomes less and less well define the net result be that the characteristic emission wavelength be smeared-out into band 10 the more systematic error however arise mainly from misalignment or wrong calibration of the spectrometer the correct focus of the spectrometer telescope may also add to the error in measure the position of spectral line since the observation of spectral line depends on the light passing through the slit the position of the lamp in front of the slit can add to the uncertainty in position of the line if it be n't place precisely in front of the slit a mention previously the slit of the spectrometer be misalign cause break in the spectral line but a these break in the line be horizontal in nature it do not affect the measurement the above factor when estimate and include in the uncertainty provide a realistic estimate about the officially accepted value of rydberg 's constant the aim of this experiment be to determine the value of rydberg 's constant to a certain degree of precision and accuracy use a grate spectrometer a sodium-vapour lamp for calibration and a hydrogen discharge lamp to observe the spectral line the basic theory behind this experiment be derive from the principle and theory of diffraction atomic spectrum and the basic idea of quantum physic the chance of success be strong with this experiment a it u apparatus with a low margin for error since most of the data analysis be do on python error due to calculation and human error be minimise although there be n't many light must be shone on the few yet significant possibility of error in this experiment since the measure equipment consists of a spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp the main source of error be the relative position of the lamp slit and diffraction grate also since the position of the telescope and centre of the cross wire be do use our naked eye accuracy be very limited there be also the systematic error that arises from the spread of wavelength widen of the spectral line this error however can not be measure a beyond a point the cross wire be too thick to accurately measure the angular width of the spectral line improvement in term of accuracy can be make by use electronic detector instead of our naked eye although our eye be sensitive they be n't sensitive enough to observe the line when the slit be at it narrow position this be prominent when two different observer may detect vary spectral line to vary degree of accuracy perform this experiment help develop skill in take measurement whilst minimise the error in them it also display the various advantage and disadvantage of use such an

electron transfer this applies to all element not just hydrogen thus we can use it to predict the wavelength emit from any atom through any energy state transmission r\\uf0a5 can also be use therefore to determine the difference in energy state through which any electron in any atom may transfer give u the value for the energy state in that atom the theory of this behavior be described in more depth in section ii spectroscopy be use to enable the repeat observation of one beam emit from the lamp when set up correctly a spectrometer be capable of make very accurate and repeatable measurement so it be important to set it up very specifically the equipment we use consist of a collimator a diffraction grate and a telescope by passing it through a diffraction grate the light beam be split up meaning multiple order could be analyze to obtain multiple value for the wavelength a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm be employ to achieve this the beam be then pas through a telescope to enable observation far description of the work of the setup can be found in section iii to carry out the experiment we observe the emission of a hydrogen lamp a tube contain low-pressure hydrogen gas after excitation through heating or electrify for example the atom in the gas lose energy in the form of photon a an electron in an atom transfer to a low energy state it emits a photon of energy equal to the difference in energy of the two state in a sample of one element only energy level of specific value exist thus only transition of specific energy can occur the photoelectric effect then result in the production of photon of certain wavelength only spectrum produce by excite gas be observe a have emission at just a few wavelength create an 'emission line spectrum in hydrogen these 'lines be give the name the balmer series 1 in the laboratory we observe just two line of which the wavelength be give by 2 where λ be the wavelength of the light emit and n represent the initial and p the final state of the atom in the balmer series p=2 and n=3,4,5 ... the fact that only line of two different color be observe do not prove n=5 do not exist it be possible other wavelength of non-visible light be emit by the gas or that the atom be not excite enough for the electron to occupy state n=5 far experimentation would be need to confirm this in order to obtain multiple measurement of λ different order of the emission line spectrum be look at figure 1 illustrates how a diffraction grate disperses a beam the order of the beam m can in theory be any integer m and \\uf066 the angle between the 0 th order and the m th order be related by the equation grate be usually give by the manufacturer in term of n number of line per mm d be easily found by calculate n must be multiply by 10 3 first to find how many line there be per m so that d can be in unit m. in this calculation we assume the thickness of each line be negligible by measure the angle \\uf066 for several value of m and plot m against sin\\uf066 the gradient of the graph becomes d λ ⁄ after multiplication by d 1 λ ⁄ can be substitute into 1 the light from the hydrogen lamp be first to be pas through a narrow slit follow by a collimate lens to produce a very thin collimate beam and then pas through a diffraction grate the light then be to be collect by a telescope consist of a camera lens and an eyepiece a crosshair x be visible through the telescope eyepiece to help with alignment all measurement be take with the line on the centre of the crosshair figure 2 illustrates the path of the beam through the setup a choice of two grate be available in our laboratory on of 300 line per mm and one of 78.8 line per mm i originally decide to use the grate n=300 because i thought this would result in a small percentage error for d take the error would be \\uf0b10.05 line per mm however upon look through the eyepiece it be see that there be more visible order with the use of the n=78.8 grate so it be decide that we use this one in order to have the opportunity to obtain the maximum number of measurement so that \\uf071 could be varied the grate be mount on a rotate grate table or turntable and the telescope which be attach to the turntable could also be rotate the turntable have a vernier scale on it which show the angular position of the turntable and the telescope use this \\uf071 be measure these property be show in figure 3. the turntable be also utilized to accurately set up the spectroscopy equipment the grate have to be at precisely 90\\uf0b0 to the beam achieve this be challenge the vernier scale on the turntable have a resolution of a sixtieth of a degree so tiny movement in the position of the telescope and angle of the table could be make such movement be make roughly and then fine-tuned use fine adjustment screw before the telescope and turntable be clamped into place it be important not to leave the hydrogen lamp on for more than 10 minute so a not to damage it so it be temporarily replace with a sodium lamp whilst position adjustment be make firstly the telescope be position so the source could be see to be align with the crosshair at 0\\uf0b0 to the beam it be then rotate through exactly 90\\uf0b0 and a mirror insert into the clamp where the grate would later sit this be exactly what be demonstrate in figure 3. the rotate grate table be then adjust until the beam could be see through the eyepiece of the telescope meaning the mirror be at 45\\uf0b0 to the beam the turntable could then be rotate through 45\\uf0b0 in order for the mirror to be at 90\\uf0b0 to the beam at which point it be replace with the diffraction grate the slit space must remain a control variable so the same diffraction grate be use throughout the experiment keep d constant it be difficult to perceive the line through the eyepiece at the begin of the experiment due to background light to try to minimize this problem the main light be turn off in the laboratory with each desk have it own table lamp which be switch off during observation through the eyepiece light from other desk 's experiment still present a problem so a piece of black card with a collimator-shaped hole be cut out and stuck round the collimator with blu-tac this prove very effective in block out background light once set up the equipment be left clamped in position so only the telescope could be move this kept the turntable in a fix positon ensure the grate remain at the same angle to the beam and the 0 th order emission line remain in the same position the source be then switch back to a hydrogen lamp through the eyepiece we observe emission line spectrum of two different color one blue and one red we concentrate on the set separately to find two value for the rydberg constant r\\uf0a5b and r\\uf0a5r respectively blue be take first the crosshair be line up with the 0 th order line which be identifiable by the fact that it be both red and blue the reading on the vernier at 0 th order \\uf0710 be note and then the three repeat reading of \\uf071m be take one by each of my lab partner and i. this be do in order to spot with a view to remove any personal bias then an average be take to minimize variation in human judgement of the reading the measurement have to be take through a magnify glass a the scale be very small and the light low the range of m be restrict by the lack of accessibility to the eyepiece at large angle and also the time we have in the laboratory it be interest to note at this point that the blue line be separate by less angle than the red which illustrate the proportionality of sin\\uf066 to \\uf06c a predict in 2 since blue wavelength be shorter than red one after collection of the raw data average of the three repeat reading be take in order to find \\uf066 for each value of m \\uf0710 minus \\uf071m be calculate after the rearrangement of 2 m be plot against sin\\uf066 for both blue and red light a figure 4 and figure 5 respectively which be show below in python the of the line of best for of both graph be obtain the gradient of the blue light emission graph be found to be 25.642 \\uf0b10.650 and the red 19.173\\uf0b10.097 the gradient of the graph be equal to d λ ⁄ recall 3 d be calculate to be 1.269\\uf0b410 -5 m \\uf0b10.06 take the error in n to be \\uf0b10.05 line per mm the gradient of both graph be then divide by d to obtain value for 1 λ ⁄ 1 λ b ⁄ be found to be 2.021\\uf0b410 6 m -1 which be repeatable because this would give a blue wavelength \\uf06cb of 495nm the range of blue light be 450-495nm 3 and this figure be within the range 1 λ r ⁄ be also repeatable since it be calculate to be 1.511\\uf0b410 6 m -1 which give a red wavelength \\uf06cr of 662nm also within the accepted range for red light 620-750nm 3 it be give that the two balmer transition have initial state n=4 and n=3 and final state p=2 2 we can use the idea that the energy of a photon be proportional to the frequency of the photon therefore inversely proportional to it wavelength to decide which color light corresponds to which energy state transition from this we can deduce that the transition from n=4 to p=2 result in the blue emission because this be the large energy state transfer and blue light have the small wavelength by elimination the red light be a result of the transition from n=3 to p=2 these value for p and n be then fill into 1 to obtain r ∞ from observation of blue light r\\uf0a5b be found to be 1.078\\uf0b410 7 m -1 and from red r\\uf0a5r 1.088\\uf0b410 7 m -1 systematic error be then address the computer calculate uncertainty on the gradient and the percentage error in d be add in quadrature to give \\uf073b of \\uf0b10.027m -1 and \\uf073r of \\uf0b10.006m -1 the percentage error for r\\uf0a5r be small only \\uf0b10.51 whereas that of r\\uf0a5b be almost five time large \\uf0b12.5 one can see from the position of the data point relative to the line of best fit in figure 4 that this be due to the presence of more variation with blue light which lead to a great uncertainty in the gradient the gradient error at first seem large on paper there should not have be much variation in the experiment because there be not many outside factor which could affect the setup moreover the equipment have a very small resolution the vernier measure to a sixtieth of a degree meaning uncertainty in the take of the reading should have be small however the experiment be conduct in very poor light for reason mention in iii a. which result in difficulty with reading the vernier scale even with the use of a magnify glass we rely on human judgement to deduce where the scale line up exactly from the raw data you can see that my lab partner and i all thought the scale line up at slightly different reading this introduce random error the range of \\uf071 m be only about 9\\uf0b0 so any error in the vernier reading whilst small result in a percentage uncertainty which be large than one would automatically expect furthermore due to the calculation \\uf0710 minus \\uf071m any uncertainty the measurement for \\uf066 would be double that in also the set up of the spectrometer have to be do very precisely it be possible we do not take sufficient care in do this a result of this could be that the grate be not at exactly 90\\uf0b0 to the beam i be not sure how this would affect the scatter of the beam far investigation would be need to confirm if this could have be a source of error there be far error to consider in this experiment one of which be the fact that the line in the observe spectrum have width although we align the center of the crosshair with the line we do not account for the fact that the line have a width result in uncertainty in the position of the line and therefore in \\uf071m i do not have time in the laboratory to investigate the size and implication of this error so have not include it in \\uf073b or \\uf073r but would have do so if i have have more time the rydberg constant have the measure value 10,973,731.6m -1 2 let u compare this with our calculate value for r\\uf0a5 of 10,780,000m -1 \\uf0b1270,000 m -1 and 10,880,000 m -1 \\uf0b1270,000 m -1 firstly let u establish if our two figure be concurrent with each other take into account uncertainty the low r\\uf0a5r could be be 1.083\\uf0b410 7 m -1 and the high r\\uf0a5b could be be 1.105\\uf0b410 7 m -1 the two result be therefore in agreement with each other a they lie within each other 's range the measure value for r\\uf0a5 also lie within the range we calculate in the laboratory although it only lie within the range of the blue emission line the large r\\uf0a5r could be be 1.093\\uf0b410 7 m -1 r\\uf0a5r in contrast be closer to the measure value than r\\uf0a5b in the laboratory the rydberg constant have be determine to be in the range of 1.053\\uf0b410 7 m -1 to 1.105\\uf0b410 7 m -1 this be concurrent with the measure value of r\\uf0a5 which be 10,973,731.6m -1 technique involve spectroscopic equipment be employ to obtain this range overall this method work very well once in position the spectroscopy equipment be simple to use and enable u to make precise measurement also there be only three parameter to measure in this experiment \\uf071 0 \\uf071 m and n. this kept the magnitude of the systematic uncertainty low have we allow more time for the experiment we could have set up the spectrometer to a more exact standard which would have reduce the uncertainty on measurement take from the telescope it would also have be useful to use a vernier scale of large size to enable easy reading and therefore less error due to human judgement if the experiment have be conduct in a separate room the main light could have be switch on for the reading of the vernier again make the scale easy to read and reduce the error use a desk that be not situate adjacent to a wall therefore allow access to all angle of the telescope would have enable u to analyze more order of the emission line spectrum give u a figure for r\\uf0a5 closer to the true value alternatively a diffraction grate of small n could have be use cause the order to have small angle between them therefore more order would be see in the angle range permit by our setup and more value of m analyze\"\n"," 'use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer the rydberg constant be found to be 1.0766e7 ± 3.07e5 m•

1.097373 × 10 7 the percentage error be ≈ 1 however the accepted value lie outside our uncertainty the small uncertainty obtain be due to the small error in the diffraction angle 10 arcminute and negligible error in the diffraction grate space t he hydrogen lamp that we will be use be a thin discharge tube that contains gaseous hydrogen at low temperature apply a high potential difference across the tube excites electron of the hydrogen atom 1 so that they be elevate to a high energy state when the electron transition back down to a quantise level of low energy a photon be emit the

from quantise energy level n 3 4 5 ... to the energy level of principal quantum number n 2 4 we be observe the balmer line rather than other line from other hydrogen spectral series because the balmer line lie in the visible part of the spectrum in this experiment we will first use the grate spectrometer to measure the angle of diffraction that the colour blue green and red undergo in order to calculate their wavelength use the grate equation 5 from this a value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h can be obtain a it be know what transition be make by an electron in the hydrogen atom to emit each wavelength of light we be analyse study of the balmer series and therefore use of the rydberg constant have it application due to the abundance of hydrogen in the universe an example be in astronomy particularly in the classification of star base on their surface temperature the strength or weakness of spectral line like those in the balmer series can indicate temperature 6 we be calculate the rydberg constant because of it important role in the rydberg formula which describes the wavelength of light emit when an electron transition from a high energy energy shell to a low energy shell within the atom this formula be of great importance due to it application and due to it contribution to the development and evolution of the atomic model chemical element can only absorb and emit photon with quantise wavelength for many chemical element these wavelength be described by the rydberg formula where λ b be the wavelength of the emit light r ∞ be the rydberg constant and n i and n f be the energy level or principal quantum number of the orbitals occupy by the electron before and after it transition respectively for our hydrogen discharge lamp the result series of spectral line be call the balmer series 7 the balmer line be the result of the follow process firstly an electron in the hydrogen atom absorbs energy in this case supply from the apply voltage across the tube and accord to the bohr model of the atom the energy absorbed by an electron to transition to a high energy level in this experiment to n 3 4 or 5 must be a multiple of an amount of energy equal to hcr ∞ where h be plank 's constant and c be the speed of light in vacuo 2 and can not be any amount of energy secondly once the electron have absorbed a quantum of sufficient energy it then transition or `` quantum leap `` to a high more unstable orbital n i this be follow by a spontaneous transition to the more stable orbital of principal quantum number n f 2 emit energy equal to the difference in energy between the two energy level in the form of a photon 8 the process of an electron transition from an excite state to a low energy state and in the process emit a photon be call

use of the grate equation see equation 3 the wavelength of the aforementioned colour in the grate spectrometer set-up light from the hydrogen lamp first pas through a slit to make a point source of light the collimator lens make the light ray parallel so it can then be diffract through a grate the wave energy spread out behind the grate because the slit space d be comparable in size to the wavelength of visible light d 78.8 line per mm the wave that spread out interfere and the result be spectral line the zeroth order spectral line occur at a diffraction angle of zero degree the high the order spectral line the great the angle the light have be diffract through a telescope be move to locate the various order and focus the spectral line to make a measurement of the diffraction angle θ. if the difference in path to a point some distance away much great than d between two slit be an integer number m of wavelength λ the two wave will meet at that point in phase result in a maximum a region of constructive interference see in figure 1 9 the difference in path be also equal to d sin θ the constituent colour have different wavelength so each correspond maximum for each

the position of spectral line occur at angle of 2πm be m be call the order number and be an integer before measurement of the diffraction angle can be make the diffraction grate must be align with the collimator first the eyepiece be focus on the cross-hair to eliminate any eye-strain when view through it the camera lens be focus use the focus knob see fig 3 7 on a distant object so that the telescope be set up to receive parallel light since light passing through the collimator in the spectrometer will be become parallel a sharp image of the entrance slit attach to the collimator when view through the telescope be achieve by adjust the collimator focus and slit size such that an image of a thin slit be form at the cross-hair when the telescope be in line with the collimator the telescope be then move through precisely 90 • use the vernier scale so that it be perpendicular to the axis of the collimator and clamped in position use the telescope rotation lock screw a diffraction grate with slit space 78.8 line per mm be insert into the mount with ruling vertical like the entrance slit so that the order produce by the diffraction be horizontally align and therefore can be view with the telescope the entrance slit be then illuminate with a sodium lamp instead of hydrogen lamp because the hydrogen lamp can overheat and cease to emit light if left on for extend period of time and the grate and mount be then rotate by the spectrometer table until it reflect light from the collimator into the telescope 10 the slit image be then centre with the cross-hair and fine adjustment knob since the telescope and collimator be at 90 • the diffraction grate be therefore 45 • to the collimator and telescope the diffraction grate be then rotate precisely through 45 • use the vernier scale so that the plane of the diffraction grate be perpendicular to light from the collimator when switch on the hydrogen lamp with a potential difference of ∼ 5000v across it the prominent colour we could observe up to the 3 rd order be blue green and red background light from lamp in the room limited the number or order we could see a high order above 3 become too faint the diffraction angle θ be measure for order 0 to 3 by move the telescope so that the centre of the cross-hair reside on each appropriate spectral line the vernier scale on the spectrometer be accurate to 1 arc minute 7 show from above the way in which the telescope can be position to find the spectral line so that diffraction angle can be measure when the angle between the normal to the grate and the telescope be 0 • our vernier scale read 209 • and 29 arcminute we first record all the angle then subtract them from 209 • and 29 arcminute to correct for the systematic error the sine of the diffraction angle θ in radian be plot a a function of the order number m. the gradient be equal to sin θ/m and be equal to wavelength of the light divide by the slit space λ/d obtain by re-arranging the grate equation equation 3 the gradient multiply by the slit space d be equal to the wavelength of the observe balmer series colour λ b and the principal quantum number n i of the electron before the spontaneous emission be 5 4 and 3 for blue green and red respectively the value for r h be hence calculate for each wavelength by use equation 1. spectral line have some thickness and be not infinitely sharp therefore there be an uncertainty associate with the diffraction angle spectral line have this thickness because the atom emit the light be move relative to the observer and the energy level can not be define to exceedingly high or infinite precision due to heisenberg 's uncertainty principle see appendix b 13 the angle be measure to the left and right of the first order blue spectral line we measure this angle to be 10 arcminute the error in 1 d be assume to be negligible and the error in the diffraction angle be assume to be fix at 10 arcminute the error in the gradient be calculate by find the first entry in the covariance matrix for the data for each colour this be do in the computer program language python figure 5 -7 show the plot for each colour observe in the hydrogen balmer series use the correct angle where a reading of 209 • and 29 arcminute corresponds to 0 • between the normal to the diffraction grate and telescope the vertical error bar be very small for each plot a the spectral line be thin result in a small error in the diffraction angle another factor that contribute to small vertical error bar be the high accuracy of the vernier scale to the near 1 arcminute the plot for blue light result in the great error for r h an order of magnitude great than for green and red see table i a source of random error enter the experiment a the mark of the vernier scale be difficult to see and sometimes there be ambiguity a to which of the mark line up indicate the minute of arc the ambiguity if there be any be always with neighbour mark i estimate this error in diffraction angle to be 2 arcminute a the uncertainty be never more than two division to the left or to the right of the mark we chose to be line up add this to the uncertainty due to the assume thickness of the spectral line 10 arcminute the result error be 12 arcminute in the diffraction angle however because 2 arcminute be quite a small error in comparison to 10 arcminute the error in the gradient and error bar have not change noticeably when introduce an improve way of accounting for this random error which by definition change for each measurement be to note down after each reading which mark could also be line up then the angle record would be the mean of the angle half-way between the small and great angle because the ambiguity exist between neighbour mark and the uncertainty would be half the difference between the great and small potential diffraction angle there be no horizontal error bar because the principal maximum be discrete and countable table i below display the result use the gradient of figure 5 -7 and equation 3 to calculate the wavelength λ b table i also show the value of r h calculate use the rydberg formula equation 1 set n f 2 for each

value r h that be calculate with blue light the percentage error in the calculate value of r h for blue the error in our mean value for r h constitutes a possible variation in the mean of less than 1 ≈0.87 this error be small because the error in the diffraction angle measure be very small 12 arcminute include the estimate random error which be assume to be fix but may have change and no other error be consider a the error in the line per mm of the diffraction grate be assume to be negligible the percentage error in the mean r h be 1.42 however the accepted theoretical value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen lie outside our uncertainty a possible source of systematic error that may have contribute to the overall increase in our value for the mean r h may include incorrect calibration when align the diffraction grate this be unlikely to be the main source of error because the value for r h when use blue light be less than the accepted value this mean the primary source of error be likely to be random error the aim of the experiment be to calculate rydberg constant for hydrogen by take measurement of the hydrogen balmer series use a grate spectrometer to do this light from a hydrogen lamp be make parallel and pas through a diffraction grate each colour in the balmer series blue green and red diffract by different angle which be measure and the sine of the angle be plot a a function of the order of the spectral line we then calculate three value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each colour use the gradient of the plot our mean value for r h be 1.113000×10 7 ± 2.342×10 4 the mean differs by ≈ 1 of the actual accepted value 109737321.568508 which lie outside our uncertainty an improvement to our experiment would be to measure the diffraction angle to high order which would reduce the error in the gradient in order to achieve this we would have to perform the experiment in a darker room with no lamp so that high order for all colour be make visible a poor assumption be also make that the error in the diffraction angle be fix however an improvement would be to measure the thickness of each of the spectral line another improvement would be to measure diffraction angle spectral order go in the negative direction this would enable u to calculate more value for r h thus reduce the effect of random error appendix a derivation of the rydberg

tungsten filament can emit spectrum where the intensity varies a a function of wavelength this be know a a continuous spectrum hot and electrically excite gas produce emission line spectrum which be characterise by the appearance of slit of define wavelength on the spectrometer when current pas through a tube contain hydrogen gas the electron become excite and move to a high energy level when they return to their original energy state they emit a photon of correspond energy the spectrum of light can be analyse use a spectrometer which consists of three key instrument see figure iii.1 light from the source pas through the slit into the lens which collimates the light ray a diffraction grate be utilised to disperse the light into a spectrum this spectrum be then focus and align onto the crosshair by employ an eyepiece the apparatus be employ a it be precise with the scale be graduate in arcminute the difference in intensity of the spectral line in a spectrum can be use to determine the temperature of the gas whilst examine the line width can provide information regard the density of the gas a diffraction grate be comprise of many narrowly space parallel slit the separation between the centre of each slit be d. for light ray of wavelength λ minimum can be observe when the phase difference be an odd integer multiple of π e.g π 3π maximum occur when the phase difference be an even integer multiple of π e.g 2π 4π the phase difference be therefore where m be the order number the path difference can be write a dsinθ a show in figure iii.1 so the equation can be simplify to the phase angle of the first minimum can be calculate with the equation where n represent the number of slit the resolve power be the minimum distance between two point so that they can be distinguish the minimum of one diffraction pattern occurs at the same position a the maximum of a second diffraction pattern a show in the m th maximum occurs at an angle θ 2 so that the minimum angle be define a the intensity at the midpoint of two equal line be therefore 20 less than the intensity at the peak meaning that the two line be distinct from one another the formula for the wavelength of a photon emit from a hydrogen atom a an transition between energy state be where p be the final energy state and n be the initial energy state both of which be integer specifically for the balmer series in hydrogen p=2 and n=3,4,5 when an electron drop from energy level n to 2 it produce a photon of a specific wavelength in the visible spectrum the colour of light emit can be determine use equation ii.8 and a colour chart light from the source e.g a hydrogen lamp pas through the narrow slit whose width could be adjust depend on light intensity a the light ray pas through the collimator they become parallel the light then pas through the camera lens onto the crosshair where the image be magnify via the eyepiece the eyepiece be focus onto the cross wire at a view distance of 25cm so that eyestrain be reduce whilst take measurement the camera lens be align so that an object 10m away be focus onto the cross wire this ensure that parallax error be minimise the telescope be align with the centre line of the collimator and a sodium lamp be position with respect to the slit a sodium lamp be use in setup rather than a hydrogen lamp a the latter would overheat after short period of time and switch off the focus of the collimator be then adjust so that an image of the slit be align with the cross wire this be complete without adjust the camera focus the demonstrator recommend rotate the cross wire to form a × rather than a a this meant that slit be easily visible the slow-motion drive and clamp screw be tune and final adjustment be make to the camera and collimator the telescope be rotate 90 degree and clamped into position a 300-slit grate be place into the holder and a ruler be use to ensure it be vertical the grate table be rotate until the diffraction grate be at a 45-degree angle from the incident light ray an initial observation of the position of the slit 's reflect image in the telescope be make and the height of the image be alter via the adjustment screw beneath the grate table reading on both scale the main scale which be graduate in degree and the secondary scale which be graduate in arcminute be take and the grate be then move through 45 degree ensure that the eyepiece be situate at 0 degree to the incident light ray the telescope be reposition temporarily so approximate position of the spectral line could be note the telescope be then revolve so that diffract image of the slit could be observe for different order e.g -2 -1 0 1 2. the error record on the result for the setup of the sodium lamp be 0.5 degree and 1 arcminute these value be base on the scale 's precision the error also consider difference between experimenter 1 's and experimenter 2 's reading table 1 illustrates the initial measurement make when set up the sodium lamp the preliminary result for the setup of the experiment show in table i be not usable a the eyepiece be not focus on the same maximum this meant that the reference angle be not suitable for take result the uncertainty in the preliminary and final result be close to negligible a the percentage uncertainty be in the magnitude of 1 × 10 −3 for both the preliminary and final result a sodium lamp be substitute for a hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be switch off when not in use to prevent overheat final adjustment be make to the slit size before measurement be take to ensure optimum intensity and resolution preliminary result be then record for each transition wavelength θ be measure against both positive and negative order some data value in the table have be replace by n/a which signifies that the reference angle for that order could not be obtain this be primarily due to light pollution from other lamp meaning that it be difficult to identify fringe line a the order m increase from -2 to 2 the reference angle decrease equation ii.2 implies that if sin θ be plot against the order m it will produce a linear relationship table iv the data for the reference angle be an average of the two-data set produce by the experimenter the result be take between order -2 and 2 where the range of the angle for red be from 168.42º to 215.03º the range for blue be from 176.94º to 207.12º and the range for purple be from 175.06º to 208.09º the final measurement follow the same general relationship a the preliminary measurement however the decrease in the reference angle becomes more consistent diminish by approximately 12º for red 8º for blue and 8º for purple whereas in the preliminary investigation the reference angle decrease by vary amount the main source of uncertainty with the result be due to parallax error an attempt to resolve this be make by take reading when level with the scale another source of error be due to the thickness of the fringe consequently all measurement be take in the centre of the fringe random error arose a it be difficult to see the cross in the dark and so the fringe be not consistently align this be resolve by periodically turn on the lamp to check alignment other potential source of systematic error be air pressure humidity and occasional defocus of the telescope both air pressure and humidity remain roughly constant during the investigation hence it be unnecessary to account for these variable moreover the defocus of the telescope be temporary and so be not problematic a with the error in the setup of the sodium lamp the percentage uncertainty in the reference angle be very small in the order of 1 × 10 −3 the percentage error in the gradient be very small in the order of 1 × 10 −2 for red and 1 × 10 −3 for purple this be due to the small y error bar and the lack of anomalous point in figure i. however the error in the y-intercept be very large a the percentage error have a magnitude of 1 × 10 2 this be a the y-intercept be small whilst the absolute error have remain roughly constant however the percentage error in the yintercept be unimportant a it be not use in calculate the rydberg constant a 300-slit grate be use so d be equal to 3.33 × 10 −6 m. use equation ii.8 the value of d and the gradient the calculate rydberg constant be 10989388.37m −1 the error in this number can be calculate by use the equation where σ x be the error in the gradient of red 0.003. this produce a figure of 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 see algebraic manipulation for both value in lab book the primary aim of the investigation be to measure the spectrum of hydrogen and to obtain an accurate value for the rydberg constant the secondary aim be to obtain an error of magnitude of less than 1 × 10 −3 the method involve make observation of the spectral line through the telescope the value of the reference angle on both the main and secondary scale be note a graph be produce of sin θ against order m and a gradient be determine from this the rydberg constant be obtain the success of the investigation be determine a value of the rydberg constant within one thousandth of the accepted value and produce a graph with no observable anomaly and a percentage error less than one percent the main failure of the experiment be produce an error of magnitude 1 × 10 −2 which come into conflict with the secondary aim the key achievement of the experiment be obtain a strong positive correlation for the linear plot for figure i and produce strong data analysis consist of error in both the gradient and y-intercept one improvement to the experimental method would be monitoring the environmental factor such a humidity and air pressure\"\n"," \"the rydberg constant have connection with many fundamental constant like planck 's constant make it one of the most fundamental constant in atomic physic it first appear in 1890 a an empirical number when johannes rydberg a swedish physicist publish his result use his model of hydrogen atom niels bohr prove that the rydberg constant be not just a number but a fundamental constant since the rydberg constant can be measure very precisely and accurately it offer invaluable help in determine other basic constant the hydrogen bright red ha line be the first and most important spectral line in balmer series the balmer series be a series of emission spectral line of hydrogen result from electron transition from high energy level down to the energy level with principal quantum number equal to two the ha spectral line enable scientist over century by measure it wavelength to finally determine the rydberg constant the experiment for determine the rydberg constant involves the photoelectric effect described by albert einstein in 1905 and bohr 's model of the hydrogen atom introduce in 1913. bohr state that the electron move around the nucleus of an atom under the influence of the electrostatic force between the electron and the nucleus act a the centripetal force accord to bohr the electron can only move in an allow orbit a oppose to infinity of orbit in classical mechanic with total energy at the nth quantum state equal to the sum of kinetic

𝑒 be the electron charge and 𝑣 be the electron 's velocity the theory of the photoelectric effect state that light consists of small packet of energy call photon and the energy of each photon be proportional to it frequency the photoelectric effect be described by the follow equation the energy 𝐸 of a photon be give by where ℎ be the planck 's constant 𝑓 be the frequency of the photon c be the speed of light 𝜆 be the wavelength of the photon and 𝐸 𝑖 and 𝐸 𝑓 be the energy of the initial and final state of the atom respectively when an atom gain energy the electron move from a low energy level to a high one during excitation this excite state be not stable and the electron drop from a high energy level to a low one result in the emission of a photon whose energy be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial state of the atom therefore the colour of the light emit can be determine by calculate the frequency of the photon emit use formula 2 hence the balmer series in hydrogen can be give by equation 5 with 𝑝 2 and 𝑛 3,4,5….the idea of bohr 's model of the atom be involve when the atom drop from the nth energy level to the second result in photon emission with specific wavelength depend on n. use equation 5 the wavelength value can be calculate and through the use of the standard colour spectrum chart the colour of the light emit can be deduce an example of a balmer series transition be show in figure 1. the main aim of the experiment carry out be to measure the hydrogen spectrum and use the data obtain to determine the rydberg constant which represent the wavenumber of the photon with the least energy that cause the ionisation of the hydrogen atom from it ground state the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ name after johannes rydberg can be express by the follow

equation 6 know a the grate equation the experimental procedure begin by set up the grate spectrometer our primary aim be to take measurement of the diffraction angle at each order number for the red and blue hydrogen spectral line and determine the average diffraction angle for each order number in order to determine the value of wavelength 𝜆 a straight line graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 have to be drawn whose gradient would be equal to 𝜆 𝑑 therefore enable u to calculate λ. the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 at each diffraction order have to be determine by subtract the average diffraction angle at each specific order 𝜃 by the average angle at zeroth order 𝜃 0 and then take the sine of the difference between the two angle finally use formula 5 the rydberg constant for each spectral line could be determine the diffraction angle be measure use the vernier scale that read at sixtieth of a degree there be a risk of random error appear when use the vernier scale due to parallax error through the use of the magnify glass the effect of parallax error be minimise the angle at zeroth order be determine for the red and blue spectral line the diffraction angle measurement be repeat three time at each order number and the average be take so that the reliability of our measurement could be enhance and so that random error could be encounter possible source of systematic error be humidity and background light permittivity of free space varies with humidity therefore this affect our value of the rydberg constant because the rydberg constant a show by formula 3 and 4 depends on the value of the permittivity of free space therefore systematic error be introduce in the experiment background light make our eye less sensitive therefore we can not see well hence we could end up miss line for the effect of background light on our measurement to be minimise a black card be take a hole be punch in it and the card be then stuck around the collimator another method we use to minimise the effect of background light be to cover the apparatus with a black cloth because it prevent the external light from go into the collimator and show up on the image after determine the average diffraction angle in each order number the follow formula have to be use to determine the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 which be the y-coordinates for plot the sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 graph y-coordinate 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 −

diffraction angle determine for each diffraction order be subtract with the average angle measure at zeroth order and then the sine of the difference between the angle be take after determine the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 for each order number a straight line graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 be drawn use python with gradient equal to 𝜆 𝑑 both the slope of the straight line for the two spectral line together with their associate uncertainty be determine use python thereby enable u to determine the wavelength 𝜆. use formula 5 the rydberg constant for the red and blue spectral line be deduce to calculate the rydberg constant use formula 5 for the two spectral line the balmer series transition be consider therefore use n=2 and p=5 for the calculation of the rydberg constant of the blue

repeat three time when the uncertainty in our average diffraction angle value at each order number for each spectral line be determine the uncertainty in our sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 value could be determine by calculate the difference between the maximum and the minimum value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 and then divide the result by 2. this enable u to plot the vertical error bar represent the uncertainty in sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 in python the uncertainty 𝜎 𝑦 in sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 can be calculate use where 𝜃 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 be the maximum and minimum average diffraction angle respectively and 𝜃 0 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝜃 0 𝑚𝑖𝑛 be the maximum and minimum average angle at zeroth order for each spectral line the maximum and minimum average diffraction angle at each order number be determine use the standard error of the mean of those angle which

correspond to those uncertainty be plot in python a show in figure 3. this enable u use python to determine the uncertainty in the slope of each straight line so that it could be use to determine the overall uncertainty of the rydberg constant value of the red and blue spectral line in this experiment the 78.8 ± 0.1 line per mm grate be chosen instead of the 100,200 and 300 line per mm grate since although the narrower the slit the great the resolution of the line the line become much dimmer a the slit be close therefore to balance out these two consideration the 78.8 ± 0.1 line per mm grate be the most appropriate in this experiment enable u to take more measurement of the diffraction angle hence increase the reliability of our result by encounter random error the number of line per unit length of our slit in the begin be suppose to be 80 line per mm but they be 78.8 ± 0.1 line per mm because it use an old definition of 2001 line per inch which be in imperial unit the 2001 line per inch approximate to 78.8 line per mm to calculate the uncertainty in 𝑑 𝜎 𝑑 the follow method be use where 𝑛 78.9 and 𝑛 78.8 be the number of line 78.9 and 78.8 line respectively the uncertainty in 𝑑

there could have be improvement on the method carry out to determine the rydberg constant even though we repeat our diffraction angle measurement 3 time for each order number use the vernier scale to take measurement we could have repeat the angle measurement more time to encounter random error and make result more reliable the use of the magnify glass while take the diffraction angle measurement reduce the effect of parallax error therefore make our measurement more accurate during the experiment we try to reduce the effect of background light either by cover the apparatus use a black cloth or punch a hole in the middle of a black card and stick it around the collimator so that external light be prevent from enter the collimator and show up on the image background light could have be a source of systematic error by make our eye less sensitive make u not see properly and we could have widen the slit reduce uncertainty if i repeat the experiment i would take into account humidity and try to determine how much it affect our rydberg constant value because it varies with the value of the permittivity of free space that be include in the rydberg constant equation thereby introduce systematic error by affect the rydberg constant value by use the level i would ensure that the diffraction grate holder be level in all direction i would reduce any misalignment and use a sharper telescope in conclusion our overall value of the rydberg constant be highly precis show that this fundamental constant can be measure at a high precision a the rydberg constant be one of the best

experiment we found an estimate of the rydberg constant by use a diffraction-grating spectrometer to measure the wavelength of emission line of hydrogen by use the gradient calculate from our graph of sin θ against order number in the rydberg equation we manage to obtain a value of 1.086 x 10 7 m -1 the rydberg constant r∞ relates the transition wavelength in hydrogen to energy difference between different level the relation can be show in the rydberg equation where n and p be integer which represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the atom respectively for this experiment we let p=2 so n=3,4,5… such that it be a balmer series the rydberg constant can also be express use fundamental constant a where me be the mass of electron c be the speed of light h be plank 's constant and α the fine structure constant hydrogen atom in a discharge lamp emit a series of line in the visible part of the spectrum these line be the balmer transition wavelength when an electron make a transition from an initial state of high energy to a final state of low energy the atom emits a photon of energy we can relate the energy of a photon to it wavelength with with p=2 balmer series we obtain the rydberg equation a show above in 1 a we use grate spectrometer we need to know how it function the spectrometer consists of three component a collimator a grate and a telescope eyepiece and camera light enters the spectrometer through an adjustable slit and pas through the collimator which transforms the light into a parallel collimate beam of light the beam uniformly illuminates the grate so that all light ray strike the grate at normal incidence a parallel beam of light be necessary to illuminate the grate so that a sharp magnify image of the slit can be form when view with the telescope the grate disperses the light so that the dispersion angle θ depends on the wavelength of light λ and the slit separation d. this be show in the equation 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑚𝜆 5 where m be the order number an incident light beam from the hydrogen lamp will be split by the grate into it component wavelength with each wavelength spread into different direction at the start of the experiment we have to calibrate the spectrometer we align the camera and eyepiece so that the source be at the cross wire we adjust the slit such that the amount of light that enters give a small uncertainty but with enough brightness we turn the telescope 90ᶱ and while look at a distant object we focus the telescope we align the telescope with the axis of the collimator without change the camera focus we place a sufficiently warm up sodium lamp in front of the collimator and align the vertical line of the cross wire so that it be in the middle of the slit the angle in the window be record and note a the final zero angle β. we take some preliminary data of the sodium lamp at different order record the wavelength we then replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp we proceed to record the angle at which each spectral line we repeat this experiment for red blue and green line observe my lab partner and i both record our own data to account for parallax error result below be for the sodium lamp 2 table i our calculate value of r∞ 1.086 x10 7 m -1 do not match the true value of r∞ which be 1.097 m -1 this be possibly due to spectrometer misalignment defocus lamp position a well a background light these all contribute to systematic error in this experiment and tiny detail like these should be consider the calculate wavelength be not exactly the same a the true value so i believe this also affected the final value of r∞ calculate however i believe that with a few minor change our setup and measure value could be improve to obtain a value of r∞ that be closer to the true value\"\n"," \"a bstract-this report detail an expel'iment to accurately calculate the rydberg constant with minimal enor and uncertainty this be do use a grate spectrometer when utitlised correctly this equipment can produce a high degree of accuracy with very low enor the spectrometer use be a realtively simple piece of equipment more advanced digital spectrometer be utilised across many modern scienctific diciplines although the basic theory behind all spectrometer be the same our final result for the rydbe1•g constant be 10887000 ± 74000 m-1 • despite the fact this be not an accurate result the method utilised and the technique discus to reduce error would produce an accurate value if the experiment we1•e to be repeat the report include in depth analysis and discussion about potential cause of error a well a technique to reduce them the aim of this experiment be to use a spectrometer to measure wavelength and thus accurately dete1m ine the rydberg constant rx this constant be use many equation to determine the wavelength or frequency of light in various series of related spectral line 1 though rx can be calculate use a series of other know constant the technique and instmments use to experimentally measure the rydberg constant be fundamental in modem science spectrometry especially have a wide range of u range from large scale astronomy 2 to the characte1ization of protein 3 in this experiment we use a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp to view the balmer series the balmer series be the emission spectrum of hydrogen that result when an electron within a hydrogen atom drop down to the energy level n=2 4 use the balmer series of hydrogen be useful a the emission spectrum consists of easily distinguishable colour line of visible light call balmer line the wavelength of this emit light be call the transition wavelength by measure the angular displacement of various emission line from a central maximum we be able to calculate the transition wavelength for hydrogen with far calculation and the use of some reference data we calcultated rx we measure the angular displacement of emission line from a central maximum in the hydrogen emission spectnun this be do use a spectrometer fig 1 show a diagram of the spectrometer use far detail of the individual component be described in section 3. when light be shone tlu•ough the grate it be diffract by different amount depend on it wavelength a show in fig 2. a the grate be make up of many naitows slit the light that pas through each slit interferes with light from all the other slit this lead to mostly destmctive inte1ference however when the path difference between ray of the same colour light be an integer multiple m of 21t the light interferes constmctively to give a maximum this be because the the wave be exactly m wavelength apart this lead to the equation ma dsin0 2 where a be the wavelength of light d be the distance between slit and 0 be the angle the light have be diffract m be also call the order number and a visual representation of the constmctive inte1ference each value of m co1telates to be show in fig 3. the pattern of light when shone through a diffraction grate and a visual representation of how order nwnber be assign to each maxmuun once m d and 0 be know it be simple to use 1 to calculate a. in this experiment the value for a be the balmer transition wavelength of hydrogen use the bohr model of the atom which describes a central nucleus orbit by electron situate on vary discrete energy level 5 we can visualise the path of the electron and understand why light be emit although the bohr model have since be replace by more accurate and complex model 5 it have a sufficient level of detail to be useful in this context the discrete energy level n define in the bohr model have integer value assign to them the most central energy level closest to the nucleus be numbered 1 with the n increase by one for each energy level situate futiher from the nucleus the nucleus of an atom have a positive charge and an electron have a negative charge therefore a an electron move fu1ther from the nucleus and up energy level it gain potential energy when an energy-rich electron transition from a high energy level to a low energy level it conserve energy by emit a photon fonned from the potential energy it no longer need in the case of the balmer series when and electron fall from an energy level n 2 to the energy level n=2 the photon emit often take the form of visible light after calculate a use 1 we can calculate r .. use the equation a 2 where n and p be integer that represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the electron within the hydrogen atom a define within the balmer series p be always 2. n be dete1mined use a colour spectnun cha1t set up the spectrometer and thus the experiment be a multistep process a prima1y task in this process be to ensure good focus in all the individual component to allow for good data collection we first focus the eyepiece on the crosshair next we point the telescope at a window and focus the camera on a building across the street the combination of the camera and the eyepiece lens creates an ideal telescope with the camera a the objective lens this telescope be mount on a rotatable platfo1m focus the camera at this distant arbitra1y point ensure that any object closer than this point would also be crisp and clear a any image would be fo1med at the focal point of the objective lens we decrease parallax e1rnr in our image by approach the telescope multiple time from different standpoint and check for parallax each time the rest of the setup be conduct with the aid of a sodium lamp in a darken room a hydrogen lamp overheats roughly fifteen minute after be tumed on a such we use it a minimal amount prior to collect data we focus the collimator to produce a sharp image of the sodium lamp that be roughly centre on the crosshair we then take a note of the reading from the vernier scale that measure the angular displacement of the telescope a it rotate around the grate table due to the darken condition in the room and the small size of the mark on the vemier scale we estimate a systematic e1rnr of± 0.03° in our reading of the scale another key factor of the spectrometer set up be to ensure that the diffraction grate be perfectly in line with the collimator so a to reduce eitor if the diffraction grate be even slightly misalign it would cause systematic e1rnr in our final result after take a reading on the vemier scale we rotate the telescope through precisely 90° and place a diffraction grate in the holder locate between the camera and collimater on the grate table we then rotate the grate table whilst look through the eyepiece until we saw a reflect image of the entrance slit there be partial diffraction of the light cause secondaiy maximum around the main reflection however the main reflection could be easily identify a the brightest band once the eyepiece be centre on the reflection we adjust the grate table to make the diffraction grate exactly ve1ticle this be difficult do do precisely due to the time constraint of the experiment use the vernier scale reading we rotate the grate table round precisely 45° so that the diffraction grate be in line with the collimator we then rotate the diffraction grate in the plane of it surface to create an image at a height sutiable for view through the eyepiece finally after lock the grate table in position we replace the sodium lamp with a hydrogen lamp in this experiment we measure the angular displacement of hydrogen emission line from a central maximum we use a diffraction grate with 300 line per millimetre a this give more intense nattower fringe and increase the number of emission line visible this diffraction grate diffract light more than the other available grate 78.8 line per millimetre a the slit size be closer to the wavelength of light when look through the eyepiece be three different colour visible line a show in fig 4. theoretically there be 4 balmer line in the visible spectmm however due to the amount of background light of the room we be unable to see the fourth we position the lamp a close to the spectrometer slit a possible to allow for maximum intensity of the emission line we close the slit to allow enough light through to see the emission line but ensure that the width of the slit be minimal we then rotate the telescope to position the crosshair on the first red maximum whilst ensure the telescope do n't deviate from this position we note the reading on the vemier scale we then repeat this process for all of the red maximum with order number between -5 and 5. there be more maximum visible outside of this range however they be dim and difficult to exactly position also the necessary angular displacement of the telescope for these far point be difficult to achieve in the anticlockwise direction due to the spatial contrainsts of the desk after record result for the red maximum we repeat the process for both the tm•quoise and purple a the purple line be often difficult to detect we open the slit to produce a wider more visible band of light this lead to an estimate ettor on our reading for purple light of± 0.05° a we be unable to accurately position the crosshair on the centre of the colour band we take multiple reading of angular displacement for eve1y emission line to reduce random ettor use the data collect in section 4 we plot a graph of order number against the sine of the angular displacement sine a show in fig 5. a the vemier scale give a value in degree and arc minute when calculate sine we have to conve1t arc minute into degree when inputting data for our graph we take the modulus of our negative value and combine them with the positive value to create few but large data set for each order number we be able to do this a the displacement of each maximum on the right-hand side of the central maximum be equal and opposite to that of those on the left-hand side combine the value produce a more accurate ettor estimation for the individual point plot and thus the decrease overall e1rnr on the gradient use equation 1 we use the gradient of each of the colour line in fig 5 multiply by the slit space to calculate a. these wavelength along with the accepted wavelength for the balmer emission series and original energy level of the electron that cause the emission 4 be show in table 1. show wavelength of light entitted in the balmer series the data for the universally accepted wavelength and the 'initial energy level column be take from previous scientific research on the balmer series 4 our ettor calculation combine many factor include misread of the vernier scale and misalignment of the cross hair on some bright band we take multiple data set and calculate an e1rnr on the mean of these result 0ul final quantize source of e1rnr be due to the diffraction grate not be perfectly nonnal to the incident light beam this cause systematic ettor a our• data be take over two session we be able to make an estimate of the ettor this cause the spectrometer be set up use the same method for both session however by examine raw data we identify a mean discrepancy of0.18° between the data take in session 1 and the data take in session 2. the calculate value for red be inconsistent with the universally accepted wavelength within the margin of e1rnr calculate there be many element of the experiment that retrospectively could have cause ettor in our collection of data and that may explain our value for the wavelength for red not be coherent with the accepted value the systematic ettor estimate due to the grate misalignment may be an underestimate if the grate be misalign by vary degree of angular displacement in the same direction great error would be present than that calculate to reduce this error we would have to take more measurement after carefully set up the spectrometer multiple time and take a mean of the result another cause of systematic error would be if the central maximum be not zeroed correctly this would be due to the misread of the vernier scale a discus in section 3. this would cause the value for the maximum displacement on the left and right-hand side of the central maximum to not be equal and opposite although there be some discrepancy in result either side of the central maximum we deem this discrepancy to be a result of random error and a such the systematic effect to be negligible random error across the experiment could be reduce by take more data the time constraint of the experiment only allow for the collection of three full data set ideally we would have many more once we have calculate l\\uf06c we use it along with the value for n show in fig 6 to calculate r ¥\\uf0a5 for each colour use 2 the mean of these result produce a final value for r ¥\\uf0a5 of 10887000 ± 74000 m -1 the scientifically accepted value for r ¥\\uf0a5 be 10973731.6 m -1 this discrepancy with the accepted value for r ¥\\uf0a5 be a direct result of the inaccuracy of our value for the transition wavelength our aim for this experiment be to calculate r ¥\\uf0a5 with a high degree of precision and accuracy with a low uncertainty of just one or two part per thousand with careful use of a grate spectrometer this should have be achievable due to time constraint and lack of experience use the equipment we do not achieve this our final result be 10887000 ± 74000 m -1 whilst this value be close to the accepted value it be still not accurate within the range of our calculate error there be many different data that contribute to our final result each with it own uncertainty a such minimize error on individual measurement be a primary concern the necessity to minimize all individual error and precisely set up equipment be clear however occasionally this necessity be partially disregard due to time constraint a we take a lot of time focus the lens we have minimal time align the diffraction grate i conclude that this grate misalignment be the large source of error in the experiment although it be numerically estimate to be a relatively small value technique to reduce this error include a more precise set up and multiple repetition of the set-up should be implement with far experience and well time management this would be achievable our precision and accuracy could be increase and uncertainty decrease by take more repeat measurement for our data again this be achievable with improve time management we could also improve accuracy by use technology to prevent human error such a misread of the vernier scale a computer sensor to measure angular displacement would have be much more accurate than the human eye in a darken room\"\n"," 'constant for all wavelength be relatively small around 2 for each meaning the result be reliable the linear relationship between the sine of the diffraction angle and order be prove graphically for all of the colour of light produce by hydrogen so the method be successful in prove the theory need to calculate the wavelength of the diffract light to improve the experiment i would have carry out the method in a darken isolated room where only one experiment be occur at a time ensure that there be a little external source of light a possible this would have be beneficial a with external source light it be difficult to see the spectral line produce by the diffraction grate and therefore it be a challenge to align the crosshair onto the centre of the spectral line by do this the uncertainty in the alignment would have decrease and consequently the overall uncertainty in the calculate value for the rydberg constant would have be small increase the reliability of the result another way to improve the experiment would be to take repeat reading of the angle of diffraction by for example both my lab partner and i take a reading of the scale for each spectral line this way a mean value could be calculate a well a the uncertainty in the angle this experiment have verify that the experimental set-up be capable of measure to a high accuracy by use data take from the set-up to calculate a know value to an acceptable degree of accuracy with small uncertainty within which the know accepted value lie'\n"," \"1 2 to determine the wavelength of light emit from a hydrogen atom when an electron change energy level the rydberg formula be use within this formula there be a scale constant know a the rydberg constant measure to be 10,973,731.57m -1 1 when the electron be excite and drop to the energy level n=2 it produce a visible spectrum call the balmer series by splitting the light from a hydrogen lamp use a grate spectrometer we be able to see these discrete line of the balmer series and measure the angle of diffraction for multiple order so that the wavelength of each of these line could be determine from these obtain value we be able to calculate the rydberg constant for each wavelength for red aqua and violet wavelength respectively the rydberg constant be found to be 1.0963±0.002745 x10 7 m -1 1.0956±0.004296 x10 7 m -1 and 1.0939±0.002558 x10 7 m -1 all of these value be within a percentage difference from the actual value of rydberg constant by ±0.3149 n 1885 johann balmer first hypothesize a formula that predict and agree with the wavelength for the visible spectral line of a hydrogen atom the balmer series only 3 year later johannes rydberg present another formula very similar to that of balmer although it predict the wavelength of any energy level transition in the hydrogen atom in this formula the rydberg constant be first introduce now over 100 year later the rydberg constant be one of the most accurately define physical constant 1 in the whole of physic demonstrate the importance of this value and how far we 've come in our understand of the physical universe for this experiment the aim be to determine the rydberg constant by observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen through a grate spectrometer observe the discrete visible spectral line through a diffraction grate we be able to measure the angle of diffraction and order for each visible wavelength in the balmer series of hydrogen use the spectrometer by take multiple reading of order and angle of diffraction a graph sin\\uf071 v m can be plot use equation 5 and therefore the wavelength determine for each colour of the emission spectrum each colour corresponds to a different energy level transition in the balmer series and a a result the rydberg constant can be calculate for each of these wavelength use 2 where p will be different for each of the wavelength the rydberg constant calculate for these different wavelength should in theory be exactly the same however in practice they will only be approximately the same due to the error in measurement of the angle a well a random error occur in the set up and collection of data for the experiment the measurement will be take use a spectrometer which have an accuracy to ±0.5 arcminute which be extremely accurate however the actual error introduce into our measurement be much great a the reading of the data relies largely on human judgment and this introduces more error if a gas be excite it will emit a spectrum of light call an emission line spectrum when look at the spectral line produce by a hydrogen lamp through a diffraction grate only certain discrete visible wavelength be able to be see the hydrogen lamp work by passing an electrical current through a hydrogen gas in a vacuum small vacuum which in turn excites the electron within the hydrogen to a high energy level 1 when these electron drop back down to their original state photon be emit that correspond to the difference in the energy level that they have move between because of the quantisation of light give by where h=planck 's constant \\uf06e=frequency of e.m wave it be clear that these correspond change in energy will have discrete wavelength for a hydrogen atom the visible line observe will have wavelength that correspond to the balmer series of hydrogen these wavelength that be observe can be described by the rydberg formula where r\\uf0a5 be the rydberg constant p be the excite electron energy level initial state and n be the level that the electron drop back down to final state for the balmer series of hydrogen n be equal to 2 and all the line in the visible emission spectrum will be drop down to this energy level from this equation we can infer that the large the transition in energy level the great the difference between n and p the small the wavelength of the photon produce therefore agree with 1 for different series such a the lymann series the value of n will change the rydberg constant be a know physical constant that have be determine to be 10,973,731.57m -1 1 and be originally use by rydberg a a fitting parameter and only later be it discover by niels bohr that the constant could in fact be calculate use other more fundamental constant for this experiment the visible wavelength of light correspond to the excite energy level 3 4 and 5 with each respectively have the colour red aqua and violet determine the rydberg constant 224\\uf0b0+9 this angle be essentially the adjustment angle and every angle measure can be take away from this in order to find the actual diffraction angle have set up the equipment spectrometer we be now able to switch off the sodium lamp and replace it with the hydrogen lamp and place the diffraction grate in the slot do this we be able to see the emission spectrum for the balmer series of red aqua and violet at different angle and order the diffraction grate have a value of 78.8 line per mm -1 correspond to a slit separation d of 1.269x10 -5 m. move only the telescope we align the cross wire with the center of each visible line and take down the angle and the arcminute value read from the vernier scale on the spectrometer my lab partner then move the telescope and focus it on the same point and take another reading this be do a to give u an estimate of the error in the angle a the vernier scale be very difficult to read in the light in measure the colour we do all of them in one go a to not miscount the order of the line do this we go in the order red aqua violet have collect the data for a many order of diffraction that we be able to observe the value of the angle be able to be process by average the two reading convert them to

red light emit from the balmer series be 656.28nm 6 compare this value with the wavelength we obtain it can be see that our result coincides with this a the actual value fall within the range of error for the red wavelength calculate from the graph to calculate the rydberg constant for this wavelength of light we rearrange equation 2 sub our value of the wavelength 656.7429nm a well a n=2 and p=3 n be always 2 for the balmer series we can calculate the rydberg constant for the red wavelength to be 1,096,319,4.18±27,453.07m -1 this give a fractional uncertainty of ±0.2504 the error in the rydberg

from the precision of the spectrometer when measure the value of \\uf071 we take two reading and to find the standard error in the angle we use \\uf073 \\uf071 ±0.5 × 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 where the range be the modulus of the difference between the 2 measurement a all of the measurement that we take have a range of between 0-5 arcminute difference the error in the angle be always very small use the propagation of error 2 the error in sin\\uf071 be show go be use the error in sin\\uf071 the polyfit function be use in python with a weight base on the reciprocal of the error in sin\\uf071 this produce an equation for the line of best fit and a covariance matrix add error bar to all the data point you can see in fig 4 that they 're extremely small and be almost not visible this be because through the propagation of error the error in sin\\uf071 mainly depends on the error in the angle which be very small due to the precision of the spectrometer for the red wavelength the line spectrum be also very clear this meant that it be clear to see where the center of the red line be perfectly align with the cross wire and in do so reduce the uncertainty in the measurement take by both myself and my lab partner however this will not have be the only source of error in this experiment when set up the spectrometer so that the diffraction grate be perfectly perpendicular to the incoming light there may have be many small error in the measurement take when reading the vernier scale this would lead to a small error in the way that the light diffracts a the wave would not be incident on the space perfectly perpendicular and a a result the diffraction grate equation 5 would not hold perfectly true although it would almost another thing that may have cause some error be the thickness of the mirror/diffraction grate if the mirror have an uneven surface then when we set up the spectrometer there would have again be some error in how perpendicular the grate would have be to the incoming wave and the same applies for the diffraction grate of course a with most experiment there will also be random error when look through the telescope the angle at which you hold your eye will affect how you see the spectral line and their position relative to the cross wire in order to try and reduce this we take the two measurement but to decrease this far we could 've take more reading a possible random error that may have also occur be that we may have knock the turntable slightly result in a slight change in the vernier scale lead to the measurement follow this 'knock to be off by a systematic amount for the aqua spectral line produce by the hydrogen the number of visible order range from -5 to 5 fig 4 and be clearly the brightest/most intense of all the spectral line visible the line of best fit through these point fig 4 have a gradient determine to be 0.0383581±0.00015040 a for the red spectrum the error in this gradient be determine in python use the covariance matrix use 6 we be able to calculate the aqua wavelength to be 486.7785±1.9087nm the error in the wavelength be found use the same error analysis a previously do for the red wavelength of light use 8 for the balmer series the know value of the aqua light emit from hydrogen be 486.13nm 6 compare the value we found for the aqua light to the know value we can see that the found value be accurate a the know value fall within the error boundary calculate to calculate the rydberg constant for this wavelength of light we a before use equation 9 sub our value of the wavelength 486.7785nm a well a n=2 and p=4 n be always 2 for the balmer series we can calculate the rydberg constant for the aqua wavelength to be 10,956,386.37±42960.77m -1 give a fractional uncertainty of ±0.3921 the error in the rydberg constant be a before calculate use 10 a the know value of the aqua wavelength be accurate to within the error bound it follow suit that the rydberg constant be also accurate a the actual value 1.0973x10 7 m -1 lie within the error boundary of the calculate value for aqua wavelength 1.0956±0.004296 x10 7 m -1 the calculate value of the rydberg constant for the aqua wavelength be far from the know value than the red wavelength this seem strange a the aqua fringe be much more visible when look at the spectrum through the telescope and so it should have be easy to place the cross wire exactly on the fringe the fact that there 's a high error and less accurate constant would suggest that there be a large deviation of individual point on fig 4 from the line of best fit lead to a large uncertainty in the gradient and through the propagation of error the rydberg constant this spread of value could have be a result of random error in the measurement a discus earlier it may also have be due to the point plot on the 4 th order m=4 here the value of sin\\uf071 fall significantly below the line of best fit and may have result in the polyfit function give a large uncertainty in the covariance matrix this value may have just be a random error in take the measurement where both my lab partner and i read the vernier scale wrong such a by half a degree finally for the violet spectral line produce by the hydrogen the number of visible order range from -4 to 5 fig 4 and be the faintest/most difficult to see of all the spectral line visible the line of best fit through these point fig 4 have a gradient determine to be 0.0343022±0.000080218 a for the other spectrum the error in this gradient be determine in python use the covariance matrix of the polyfit function use 6 we be able to calculate the violet wavelength to be 435.3076± 1.0180nm once again the error in the wavelength be found use the same error analysis do for the red and blue spectrum use 8 the know wavelength of violet light emit by the balmer series of hydrogen be 434.05nm 6 unlike the previous two wavelength the know value for the violet light do not fall within the error bound of the value we calculate follow on from this the result rydberg constant found from this wavelength be 10,939,172.35±25,582.01m -1 which like the wavelength do not coincide with the actual rydberg constant a the actual value do n't fall within the error boundary the fractional uncertainty for the value obtain be ±0.2339 this value for the rydberg constant be the furthest from the actual value of all of the wavelength we measure yet despite this it have the small fractional uncertainty in the value this suggests that the data plot follow the strong trend and the point be the least spread out from the line of best fit this strange contradiction could have be a result of the turntable be slightly unknowingly adjust between take the aqua result and the violet a we take the violet result last they would be the only result effect in such a way if the turntable be move and the vernier scale adjust slightly in the positive direction it would explain why the gradient increase a the positive value for the order would increase slightly and the negative one would decrease lead to a steeper gradient if the gradient be slightly more shallow the wavelength calculate would be small and may have be closer to the know value of 434.05nm another thing to consider for the violet light be that the line spectrum of this wavelength have the low intensity and be the hardest to see because of this we be not able to take measurement for all of the order with 3 reading that we be not able to see -5 -3 and 3. because this data be miss from the graph we do n't know how it may have affected the gradient if the point be there then the gradient may have either be different or the uncertainty in the gradient may have increase lead to the rydberg fall within the error bound v. conclusion this investigation have be to determine the rydberg constant use the rydberg formula 2 this be do by find different wavelength from the line emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp and measure the angle of diffraction through grate spectrometry and use equation 5 to determine the wavelength of each wavelength emit correspond to different energy level transition in the balmer series use this method we obtain 3 result for the rydberg constant for different wavelength of light that be all within a percentage difference from the actual value of the constant by ±0.3149 although the rydberg constant for the violet wavelength do not have error bound that fell within the actual value it be still extremely close and still a good approximation of the rydberg constant from the result you can see that the relationship between the sine of the angle of diffraction and order be linear confirm 5 and from the similarity of the 3 value calculate for the rydberg constant it show that the rydberg formula very accurately describes the wavelength of an emit photon when an electron change transition level within a hydrogen atom in order to improve the experiment we would have carry out the experiment multiple time take multiple reading at least 3 for each measure angle each time we repeat the experiment we would have set up the diffraction grate again so if there be any systematic error in the set up it would be eliminate by take the average result for the angle from the different experiment we could have also carry these experiment out in a darker room alone a there be other light source in the room which make it more difficult to see the spectrum despite a very accurate value for the rydberg constant have already be obtain it be still important to revisit old theory that be still very much valid today and continue to test them in use equation 5 and combine it with the rydberg formula 2 we be able to determine accurate value for the rydberg constant with small error within which the know value lie\"\n"," \"the rydbe1•g constant which relates electron transition in atom to the wavelength of the energetic photon emit be fundamental to atomic physic we aim to determine the value of this constant to a high degree of accuracy and p1•ecision by utilise a grate spectromete1• to diffract the light from a hyd1•ogen discharge lamp the resultant emission spectrnm be obse1•ved and the diffraction angle of the spectral line be measm•ed to calculate their associate wavelength and thus the rydberg constant red cyan and violet spectral line we1•e obse1•ved with wavelength 636.0 nm 482.2 nm and 432.0 nm 1•espectively the value of the rydberg constant be determine to be 1.113 ± 0.019 x 10 7 m-1 meaning the accept ed value of 1.097 x 10 7 m-1 lie within the standa1•d enor of the measure value the precision of this result could have be imp1•oved by take more measm•ements and it discrepancy from the accepted value be deduce to have likely be the result of an error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate the non-invasive nature of spectroscopy which can be use to study any light source make it extremely useful in the identification of property of a light source all light source produce a spectrum where emission be concentrate at particular discrete wavelength and spectrum be specific to each element the consequence of spectroscopy have far numerous area of physic aid the study of object on scale from nanometre to parsec one such example be the analysis of the position of spectral line of the light from distant star to determine property such a their constituent element temperature and velocity l a discus in the theory section the rydberg constant be pivotal in the understand of these spectrum not only do it relate the wavelength of an emit photon to the change in energy state of the atom 's electron but it can be express in term of other fundamental constant by consider bohr 's model of the atom 2 therefore very precisely determine the value of rydberg 's constant work both to verify important aspect of atomic and quantum theory and to far establish the value of other constant this experiment aim to define rydberg 's constant to a high level of accuracy and precision and it result will show the extent to which this be possible in the laboratory spectroscopy u a lens or miirnr to produce a collimate beam of light and disperses it with a diffraction grate or prism the disperse spectrum be focus and view with an eyepiece a diffraction grate can be consider a n equally space nairnw slit with slit separation d. maximum occur where there be constructive interference and therefore where the phase difference between neighbour ray be m x 2rr 1 where m be any integer give that the path difference and phase difference be related by phase difference path difference x 2 2 and the path difference be give by d x sine 3 a show in fig 1 where 0 be the angle between the n01mal and a line drawn from the grate to that maximum the maximum be found at angle which satisfy the equation d x sin0 m x .l therefore a plot of sin0 against m for any set of spectral line of the same wavelength produce a straight-line graph with gradient equal to j.jd it should also be note that for a diffraction grate with d slit per millimetre d when excite a gas will absorb energy which be use to promote electron in atom to high energy state when an electron randomly fall to a low energy state a discrete amount of energy be release in the form of a photon accord to the define gap between energy state for a particular atom this amount of energy conesponds to the wavelength of the emit photon il a give by the equation he a 6 where his planck 's constant and c be the speed oflight a refened to in the intrdoduction section the emission spectnun be specific to each element since each atom have different gap between it energy state this experiment study the balmer series for hydrogen where electron fall from the 'nth energy level to the second energy level a represent in fig 2. this spectmm have eight defmed spectral line in the visible region 3 five of these line be expect to conespond to electron transition from the ninth eighth seventh sixth and fifth energy level to the second and emit light of a violet colour an electron transition from the fourth to the second energy level be expect to emit light of a cyan colour and a transition from the third to the second energy level be expect to emit red light 4 however the relative intensity of these spectral line widely vary so it be expect that observation will be limited to few line than those list the rydberg constant r 00 relates the energy level of the 2 initial and final state of an electron to it wavelength in the case of the hydrogen bahner series the transition wavelength be give by 1 a 7 where n be an integer which represent the fmal energy level of the electron after the transition the rydberg constant can also be express in term of physical constant a mention in the introduction section where e be the charge on an electron me be the mass of an electron and ea be the permeability of free space the setup consist of a hydrogen discharge lamp from which light ray pas through a nairnw slit into a collimator the collimate beam be diffract by a grate and the resultant spectrum be focus and view with a telescope the setup of the spectrometer from both plane and birds-eye view be show in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively fig 3 show the vemier scale of the spectrometer to read the scale take the half-degree mark on the low angular scale just before the zero value of the upper scale then read from the mark on the upper v emier scale where the two scale exactly align in fig 3 this be at six arcminute the sum of these two value after have convert the number of arcminute to degree be the overall angle in degree iv experimentalmethod a preliniinaiy test where the hydrogen discharge lamp be left switch on to determine it longevity show that the lamp would overheat and dramatically decrease in intensity after approximately fifteen minute since the focus and alignment can be complete with any light source an altemative such a a sodium lamp whose intensity do not noticeably decrease with time be found to be useful although a sodium lamp would produce a different spectnun the position of the zeroth order maximum be identical for all light source and be the only order necessa1y for calibration in order to take precise and accurate measurement it be necessa1y to fully calibrate the spectrometer the dial on the front of the eyepiece be use to focus on the crosshair for optimum result the focus of the camera should be at infinity this be impossible so the diffraction grate be remove and the camera be focus on a distant well lit object in the order of ten of meter away in order to find the point at which the telescope be exactly align with the axis of the collimator the telescope be rotate until a vertical band of light be visible at the intersection of the crosshair the crosshair be rotate to appear a an x rather than a '+ to make it easy to dete1mine the exact position where the band of light intersect the centre of the crosshair in order to precisely dete1mine this position the slit width be adjust to be close to it minimum a the band oflight be not exactly ve1tical screw on the grate table be adjust to alter it height the collimator be then focus on the crosshair so that the edge of the light beam be well define the value on the vernier scale be record at this position and the telescope rotate exactly 90° clockwise in order to be perpendicular to the axis of the collimator in order to then exactly align the diffraction grate with the normal of the collimator a plane mitrnr be place in the diffraction grate holder on the grate table give that a plane mitrnr 3 reflect a light ray by 90° the 45° position of the plane mitrnr can be determine a the point where the reflect light result in a vertical band of light at the centre of the crosshair this inte1mediate alignment process be show in fig 5. the reading on the v emier scale be again record and the grate table rotate exactly 45° clockwise this process ensure that the diffraction grate be exactly normal to the axis of the colliniator the plane mirror be then replace with a diffraction grate of specification 300 line per millinietre to the near millinietre a show in 3 the diffraction angle be inversely propo1tional to d so a diffraction grate with more line per millimetre give a spectmm with large spread of spectral line and therefore a large spread of data with the '300 line per millimetre diffraction grate in the holder the telescope be rotate through approximately 60 degree either side of the central maximum to observe the general emission spectnun this spectmm be sketch note the colour and relative intensity of the emission line the side of the central maximum take a positive for the value of m be ai•bitra1y but have to be kept consistent the positive and negative direction assign be show on fig 3 and fig 4. for a many order a could be observe include the zeroth order the angle in degree and the colour of the emission line be record measurement be repeat and an average angle for each emission line calculate the experiment be can-ied out in a dark laborato1y to eliminate a much background light a possible which would have inte1fered with the resultant spectmm the emission spectmm from the hydrogen discharge lamp appear approximately a show in fig 6. only three colour of spectral line be observe red cyan and violet give that the relative intensity of the violet line decrease a the value of n increase l it be deduce that this spectral line could only sensibly coll'espond to a nvalue of either n 5 or n 6. the intensity of the maximum decrease a the order increase to the extent that there be no third order positive or negative line for the violet light the central maximum appear a a bright pink-pwple colour due to the supe1position of wave of each colour and the dispropo1tionately high intensity of the red spectral line the angle at which the central maxinia be found be subtract from all measurement to calculate 0. although the vemier scale be accu1'ate to 1160 th of a degree it be deem unrealistic that the angle could be measu1'ed to this degree of accuracy a it be fairly difficult to detennine which two line on the low and upper scale be exactly align therefore an e1rnr of 6 arcminute 0.1 degree for each measurement be chosen since the final measurement of 0 be an average of two individual measurement the e1rnrs be add via the quadrature method since there be too few measurement to calculate a standard deviation to give an overall e1rnr in 0 of 0.07° this translates to an e1rnr of 1.22 x 10-3 in sin 0. a plot of sin0 against order m for the hydrogen lamp be show in fig 7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the least square method be use to dete1mine the gradient of the linear fit line which be weight by the 4 inverse of the ell'or in sin0 this gradient be directly proportional to the wavelength a show in 3 wavelength of 432.0 nm 482.2 nm and 636.0 nm be evaluate for violet cyan and red spectral line respectively to 4 significant figure the e1rnr in these wavelength be calculate to be 15.09 nm the value of the rydberg constant r 00 can be detennined individually for each colour of spectral line the result of which be show in table 3. it be also possible to plot the wavelength of each colour spectral line against a specify function of n a discus in appendix 2. the result of calculate the rydberg constant individually be show in table 1. since the value of n for the violet spectral line be undetermined the constant for both possible value of n be calculate i. the value and their uncertainty be quote to four significant figure error calculate with the quadrature method .. violet 1 corresponds to an electron transition from the sixth to the second energy level violet2 corresponds to an electron transition from the fifth to the second energy level the accepted value for the rydberg constant be 1.097 x 10 7 m-1 to 4 sf 5 the rydberg constant be expect to have the same value for all colou1 's of spectral line systematic e1rnrs would have contribute fairly equally to all colour of spectral line and repeat give some confidence that the violet spectral line diffraction angle have be coll'ectly measu1'ed give that the value of the rydberg constant for violet2 be also closer to the accepted value it be therefore dete1mined that the violet spectral line observe coll'esponded to an n-value of five this be deem sufficient ground to exclude the violet 1 result the standard e1rnr of the mean rydberg constant over the three colou1 's of spectral line be determine by two method and the validity and appropriateness of each ass the first method calculate the ell'or by quadrature result in an e1rnr of 194500 m-1 the second by calculate the standard deviation of the data to give an estimate of the random ell'or in the mean which give an ell'or of 94070 m-1 give that three data point be insufficient to calculate a representative standard deviation the large ell'or be accepted this result in an overall rydberg constant of 1.113 ± 0.019 x 10 7 m-1 to 4 sf represent a percentage difference of 1.46 from the true value the accepted value be therefore within the standard error of the measure constant the systematic error cause the discrepancy between the accepted and measure value could be due to an error in the value of the slit separation d. the option of a diffraction grate with 80 line per millimetre be also available but the grate with 300 line per millimetre be more suitable for the experiment a justified in the experimental method section this alternative diffraction grate in the laboratory be label a 80 line per millimetre but be discover in fact to have be manufacture use imperial unit and therefore have 2000 line per inch 6 this discrepancy could also apply to the diffraction grate with 300 line per millimetre which be use in the experiment if so a '300 line per millimetre grate would correspond to 7500 line per inch therefore the grate would have approximately 295.3 line per millimetre correspond to a small value of d. a small value of d would increase the value of the wavelength for all colour of spectral line and therefore decrease the calculate value of the rydberg constant however if this theory be to be apply the new calculate constant disregard error would be 1.096 ± 0.020 ´ 10 7 m -1 to 4 s f. lead to the conclusion that although other systematic error may be present an incorrect value of d could largely explain the discrepancy in the value of the rydberg constant an error in the value of d explains why the constant increase a the value of n decrease if the diffraction grate have a value of d small than 300 see 5 the value of sinq would decrease by a small amount due to this error when the wavelength of light be small this would result in the wavelength calculate be small than the true value for all colour of spectral line with violet line be the least affected the rydberg constant be inversely proportional to the wavelength therefore the constant would increase by the small amount for violet spectral line due to this error and by the large amount for red spectral line another possible error could be due to the diffraction grate not be exactly normal to the axis of the collimator more thorough examination of the data collect show slight discrepancy between the angle measure at opposite order where the expectation be that the diffraction angle would be identical this be especially noticeable in the red spectral line which could have contribute to the value of the rydberg constant for these spectral line be large than that for cyan or violet spectral line the value of rydberg 's constant be successfully determine by measure the diffraction angle of the spectral line produce by a hydrogen discharge lamp the accepted value be found to lie within the standard error of the measure value demonstrate the accuracy of the spectrometer a an instrument however a relatively low precision of 1.71 be achieve give that the vernier scale be accurate to the near arcminute or to 0.017° this be due to a large error in q. give that the error reduces by the inverse of the square root of the number of reading take this error could have be reduce by increase the number of measurement it be also possible that an error of 6 arcminute 0.1° on the diffraction angle reading be an overestimate a this be six time large than the precision of the instrument additional measurement would have also far detailed the error result from the diffraction grate not be normal to the axis of the collimator and therefore necessary compensation could have be make many laboratory condition could have contribute to the total statistical error the refractive index of air varies with temperature and pressure 7 so small variation in these condition would alter the diffraction angle give that all the data be collect in one laboratory session the temperature and air pressure be unlikely to have significantly change between measurement carry out the experiment in a vacuum chamber would have fully overcome these problem the high the intensity of the spectral line the easy it be found to determine their exact position due to the nature of the hydrogen lamp the intensity of the spectral line decrease with time high order be measure last for all colour so the accuracy of the diffraction angle decrease for these measurement to tackle this issue the hydrogen lamp should have be replace or switch off and allow to cool frequently and the measurement take in a random order to reduce the effect of this error in the conclusion section the presence of an error in the slit separation be theorise future experiment could look to test this theory for the diffraction grate with 300 line per millimetre these find would be extremely useful for future optic laboratory experiment a n-value of five be use for the violet emission line a discus in the result error and discussion section the gradient of the linear fit be 8.484 ± 0.136 ´ 10 -8 m to 3 d.p which yield a rydberg constant of 1.179 ± 0.019 ´ 10 7 m -1 to 3 d.p this be a fairly large discrepancy between this value and the value of the constant when calculate for each spectral line individually this be likely to be due in majority to the inaccuracy of a linear fit for so few data point 8 if several more spectral line have be observe and measure this method would have be superior for determine the rydberg constant\"\n"," \"in the follow experiment the rydberg constant r be calculate use a grate spectrometer the angle of diffraction 𝜃 of the spectral line be use to calculate the transition wavelength of the balmer series for the hydrogen emission spectrum this be do use the grate equation the transition wavelength be then far use to calculate multiple value for the rydberg constant the mean of these value be calculate to give one final value for r which be 10790078.35 ± 23082.98 𝑚 −1 and be within 2 of the know value in this experiment we use a spectrometer which consists of a collimator diffraction grate 78.8 line per mm and telescope to calculate the rydberg constant a hydrogen lamp be use a a source of light we use our knowledge of bohr 's postulate and transition series to calculate the angle of diffraction of the balmer series we use our knowledge of wave and diffraction to calculate the transition wavelength this experiment make u use knowledge we already have to calculate an extremely important constant we calculate the rydberg constant a it can be calculate to a high precision and accuracy even while use first year lab equipment it importance stem from the fact that it be connect to many fundamental constant a can be see below in eq.4 a see in fig 1. the light from the source enters through an adjustable slit which make it a narrow beam of light the slit be position at the focus of the collimator the beam of light be therefore collimate and convert into a parallel beam this light then hit the diffraction grate which disperses it such that diffraction angle 𝜃 depends upon the wavelength of light 𝜆 and the slit separation 𝑑 of the grate when different colour of light enter the spectrometer they be diffract by different angle therefore green and red light can be see have different value of 𝜃. the telescope be attach to an arm that rotates the angle of rotation can be accurately measure use the vernier scale situate on the base of the arm the eye-piece have a perpendicular set of crosshairs that help in accurately reference and hence accurately measure the rotation angle a diffraction grate be technically a number n of narrow equally-spaced slit with separation 𝑑 𝑑=1/n between slit a maximum occurs when the phase difference ∆𝜙 between two ray of light of wavelength 𝜆 be an integer multiple 𝑚 of 2𝜋 𝑚 be know a the order number 3 transition series in hydrogen and the rydberg constant accord to bohr 's postulate an electron can orbit the nucleus in a stable orbit without lose energy therefore it energy be constant in that orbit and only change when it move to a different orbit an electron can move to a high orbit by absorb energy i.e by absorb a certain wavelength of electro-magnetic radiation it can also move to a low orbit by emit a certain wavelength of electro-magnetic radiation the transition wavelength can be calculate use the formula where n be the energy level of the initial state and p be the energy of the final state of the electron 𝑅 be the rydberg constant it have a value of 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 and can be write in term of some fundamental constant a where 𝑐 be the speed of light ℎ be plank 's constant 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of an electron and 𝛼 be the fine structure constant 1/ 𝛼=137.036 𝛼 be dimensionless the balmer transition series in hydrogen be when p=2 and n=3,4,5,6…this mean that the electron be drop down from high energy level to the 2 nd energy level the balmer transition wavelength be part of the visible spectrum the follow sequence of operation be follow to align and focus the spectrometer correctly so a to get accurate reading i keep both eye open the eyepiece be focus on the cross-wire so a to remove strain on the eye ii the camera be focus on a distant object 5-10 meter away so a to remove parallax between the cross-wire and the image iii the hydrogen line from a hydrogen lamp tend to grow weaker a the tube age and therefore it get harder to take reading during an experiment therefore a sodium lamp be use to set up the spectrometer and the hydrogen lamp be kept untouched till the start of the experiment iv the telescope which consists of the camera and eyepiece be align with the axis of the collimator the helium lamp be kept near the slit to illuminate it the collimator be then focus to get a sharp image of the slit on the cross-wire this be do without change the focus of the camera v the camera and collimator be align so that the slit be at the cross-wires and the reading of the two scale be note at 180°0′ vi the telescope be move through 90° to the point where the scale read 90°0′ and be clamped a grate of value 78.8. line per mm be put in the holder the grate surface be not touch a it be very fragile vii the grate table be rotate until a reflect image of the slit be see in the eyepiece this indicate that the grate surface be at 45° to the incident beam viii the grate be then rotate by precisely 45° to set it at normal incidence ix the telescope be rotate to large angle it be found that the image of the slit be not at the same height the adjustment screw at the bottom of the grate table be use to make the grate ruling precisely parallel to the rotation axis of the table this be do so that all the image be at the same height i the sodium lamp be replace by the hydrogen lamp and the slit width be kept to the minimum so a to reduce the uncertainty ii the telescope be kept so that the central un-diffracted image of the slit be at the cross-hairs and the reading on the scale be record this be the zero point and be use a reference iii the telescope be then move from the zero point to the right and then to the left the angle of diffraction of the three different colour line red cyan and blue be record they be record up until the 4 th order in both the positive and negative direction i.e for m=-4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 4. the red cyan and blue line correspond to the transition wavelength of n=3,4 and 5 respectively iv four reading be take per line two by me and two by my partner this help reduce random error and give a value of uncertainty for the angle of diffraction of each line the uncertainty for the diffraction angle of each line be calculate by first calculate the standard deviation 𝑠 use the scipy library on python and then find the standard error of measurement by use the formula where 𝑛 𝑖 be the number of observation in this case 𝑛 𝑖 4. v the average of the four reading be take this be 𝜃 𝑅 𝜃 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜃 𝐵 for the red cyan and blue line respectively three plot be make on python of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑅 𝑣𝑠 𝑚 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝐶 𝑣𝑠 𝑚 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝐵 𝑣𝑠 𝑚. the gradient and uncertainty of the gradient be calculate through analysis on python vii 𝑑 be calculate use the formula 𝑑 1 𝑁 and it uncertainty be estimate a the manufacturer do not provide one discus far in section iv vii a can be see from eq 2. the gradient of the plot be equal to 𝜆 𝑑 therefore each of the slope be multiply by 𝑑 to find the transition wavelength for red n=3 cyan n=4 and blue n=5 which be 𝜆 𝑅 𝜆 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜆 𝐵 respectively the uncertainty of the various wavelength be calculate by add in quadrature the uncertainty of the gradient and the uncertainty of 𝑑. viii the rydberg constant be calculate for

uncertainty be found by add in quadrature 𝜎 𝑅 𝜎 𝑐 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜎 𝐵 x there be also a 4 th line which be violet in colour and corresponds to the transition wavelength of n=6 the violet colour line be barely visible especially during the high order line and be therefore ignore discus far in section iv there be also some fade line of various colour in-between the line of the hydrogen spectrum these be ignore too discus far in section iv grate for student lab be produce by take a cast of a master grate this be do use a suitable material such a cellulose acetate when the cast dry it be remove from the master grate there be usually some shrinkage and therefore these replica be never a good a the master therefore the uncertainty in 𝑁 be estimate to be ±2 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑚𝑚 t j glynn 1993 the data for the diffraction angle can be found in section vii 3 rydberg constant cyan 𝜆 𝐶 𝑛 4 the data for the diffraction angle can be found in section vii the data for the diffraction angle can be found in section vii table .3. during the experiment it be observe that there be a faint violet colour line a part of the first and second order line this line be n't visible in the high order spectral line this line be that of transition wavelength 410.17nm and n=6 it be part of the balmer series but be barely visible a it lie on the edge of the visible spectrum very close to the ultra-violet part of the spectrum our cone our not very sensitive to this part of the visible spectrum and therefore we be unable to see these line past the second order there be also some random faint line of different colour in the middle of the red cyan blue and violet line of the atomic hydrogen spectrum these line be part of the emission spectrum of molecular hydrogen a the tube age the atomic hydrogen spectrum line become dimmer and the line of the molecular hydrogen spectrum become brighter james e. park 2002 this be why the reading be take quickly and the lamp be periodically switch off to let it cool the possible random error have already be state but there be also a few possible source of systematic error if the beam from the source be n't collimate properly the ray of light would hit the diffraction grate at various angle and this could lead to the ray be diffract at different angle than expect another possible source of systematic error be that when the hydrogen lamp be left on for too long the intensity of the light from it reduce this lead to the maximum become dimmer and the minimum become brighter therefore there be n't much of a difference between the appearance of a maximum and minimum and the diffraction angle of a minimum might have be record instead of that of a maximum systematic error could also have occur due to human error such a reading the vernier scale wrong the vernier scale be read use a magnify glass and due to parallax error the scale could have be read wrong it be also extremely easy to not align the instrument properly lead to faulty reading the calculate value of r be 𝟏𝟎𝟕𝟗𝟎𝟎𝟕𝟖 𝟑𝟓 ± 𝟐𝟑𝟎𝟖𝟐 𝟗𝟖 𝒎 −𝟏 the merit of this experiment be that a spectrometer be use which be a highly accurate device which when properly align have a precision of ±0.2𝑛𝑚 for yellow light it be easy to take a large amount of data use the spectrometer and this help reduce the random error in the value of the angle of diffraction wavelength and hence the rydberg constant this be evident in the final result which be within 2 of the accepted value of r and in the uncertainty which be 0.2 and be very small some demerit of this experiment be that it use a hydrogen lamp which tends to get dim and this could lead to systematic error there be a high chance of human error during the alignment and measurement process the use of the replica of a grate also lead to an uncertainty this be evident in the result a the random error be not large enough to make up for the discrepancy in the calculate value this mean that it be systematic error which be cause this discrepancy vi refrences 1

be also very accurate ohann balmer first discover an equation that could accurately predict the position of the visible spectral line for atomic hydrogen in 1885. he derive this equation empirically use measurement of hydrogen line in the solar spectrum just five year later johannes rydberg generalize this into a formula that could predict the wavelength of any of the line in the hydrogen emission spectrum and later it be extend for other hydrogen-like ion that have a nucleus with one electron the spectral line described by balmer 's equation be know a the balmer series five other spectral series for the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen be later discover name after their correspond discoverer there be more series beyond this but these be unnamed all of these series have similar closely link equation which describe the position of the spectral line a outline by rydberg 's general formula for all wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum however a theoretical understand of why these formula work do not arrive until niels bohr offer his model of the atom in 1913 1 in this model the electron in the hydrogen atom be say to occupy a discrete quantum energy level brought about by the electrostatic force between the electron and proton these energy state can be visualize a distinct orbit of the electron around the central nucleus the electron be capable of transition through energy state but since the energy of each state be fix only distinct jump correspond to specific energy can be make when hydrogen gas be heat to high temperature the electron will jump up from it original energy level to a high one this leaf the electron in an unstable state so it jump back down to it original position release a photon which have energy equivalent to the difference between the energy of the energy level each transition will always produce a photon of the same energy and wavelength so specific colour in the electromagnetic light spectrum can be observe and these line make up the hydrogen spectral series many model have be propose before this but bohr 's model be rapidly accepted because it be the first one to account for the structure of the empirical rydberg formula his theory demonstrate how the rydberg formula reflect the discrete energy state transition of the electron in a hydrogen atom bohr be also able to define a constant within the rydberg formula know a the rydberg constant in term of more fundamental quantity be able to determine the rydberg constant accurately by experimental procedure be significant because hydrogen be the most abundant element in the universe and it spectral emission line from stellar object be observe and analyse frequently in optical astronomy the aim in this investigation be to determine an experimental value for the rydberg constant which be both accurate and precise have a low percentage error the spectrometry apparatus use in this experiment should have a high accuracy which should theoretically allow for the measurement for the value to a few part in a thousand each energy level of the hydrogen atom have a define associate energy for an electron occupy that level these level be represent by integer know a the principal quantum number the far the electron from the nucleus the large the number at it ground state n=1 the electron be at it low possible energy level and be consider stable the electron can be raise to an excite state if energy be supply to it when the electron transition back down to the determine the rydberg constant use grate spectrometry j the intensity of maximum decrease with increase θ and through preliminary observation it can be quickly determine that the order of maximum can not be detect clearly above m ±3 therefore for each wavelength 3 order of maximum will be measure on either side of the central maximum even though the balmer series consists of 4 spectral line in the visible spectrum the shortest wavelength line be difficult to resolve due to background light and so be exclude the reference angle at which the diffraction angle be zero and the purple mixture of all the wavelength could be see be measure to be 204° 5′ where ′ represent one arcminute and be equivalent to 1/60 of a degree the reading for θ be make when the crosshair be center in the middle of the spectral line each line have a measure thickness of 4′ which contributes an error of ±2′ to θ. another source of uncertainty arose from the difficulty in reading the vernier scale and the error for be approximate from the variation in repeat measurement which turn out to be ±3′ therefore the standard error in the diffraction angle θ be estimate to be 𝜎θ ±5′ or 0.083° and this error be propagate to give a standard error in sin θ and hence the error in the gradient and wavelength could be determine a potential source of systematic error in this experiment would be due to the refractive index of air since the rydberg formula calculates wavelength for light in a vacuum however since we have no method for measure the temperature or humidity of the laboratory environment it be difficult to estimate the refractive index of the air other factor that give rise to numerous possibility for systematic error include background light slit separation error and defocusing or misalignment of the spectrometer apparatus during experiment however it have be attempt to minimize or eliminate the effect of these factor a much a possible so we can therefore assume that their overall effect be negligible in our analysis the standard error for the rydberg constant for each wavelength be determine a follow the standard error of the mean for the rydberg constant could be found from the standard deviation of the value a rearrangement of 2 show that the gradient of the line in fig 5 can be use to calculate the wavelength of the spectral line a follow the diffraction grate have 300 line per mm so the slit separation d can be calculate to be 3.3 \\uf0b4 10 -1 m. table 1 show the gradient of each straight line fit for the three wavelength of spectral line obtain from fig 5 their correspond calculate wavelength and rydberg constant value with all associate error the final value of the rydberg constant be take a the mean average of these three value give r 1.0940 \\uf0b4 10 7 ± 6.7 \\uf0b4 10 4 m -1 the purpose of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant r to a high degree of accuracy and precision by reduce and eliminate the effect of systematic and random error through the experimental procedure and use of apparatus the value of the rydberg constant obtain have a percentage error of 0.61 and be within 0.30 of the correct value of the rydberg constant of 10 973 731.6 m -1 5 this show that our value be both accurate and precise and therefore our experiment successfully achieves the initial aim set out for the investigation our final outcome be significant because it show empirically that the experiment do match and reflect the underlie theory propose by bohr in his model for the atom it have also show that the experimental method we use be reliable and reproducible and that we be able to carry out the experiment to a high caliber with more time and resource available the experiment could have be improve far by make more measurement to reduce statistical uncertainty and more careful control or consideration of variable that could have add systematic error to our result\"\n"," \"light from a hydrogen lamp be project through a slit collimator diffraction grate and the result diffraction pattern be observe use a telescope analysis of the diffraction pattern yield a linear relationship between the reciprocal of the wavelength and difference

hence i propose the experiment verify the value of rydberg 's constant this result be significant because it developed our understand of the structure of the atom and help lay the foundation for quantum physic spectroscopy be an impactful analysis technique which reach into many different area of science and engineering for example study exo-planets in astrophysics the presence size mass and orbit of a planet can be determine by doppler spectroscopy and the atmosphere composition can be determine by transit method 1 in the late 1800s it be know that-when make to glow in an electric discharge tube-gaseous hydrogen emit light at four specific wavelength alpha beta gamma delta upon investigation balmer discover that these wavelength obeyed the empirical formula where λ be wavelength of the emit light 𝑛 𝑖 =3,4,5,6 and k be some constant later rydberg found that a more general formula of this form could describe spectrum from other element also where λ be wavelength of the emit light 𝑛 1 𝑛 2 ∈ ℕ and 𝑛 1 𝑛 2 and 𝑅 ∞ be rydberg 's constant follow bohr propose a model of the atom in which electron could only exist in discrete energy state correspond to orbit accordingly electron fall from high to low quantise energy state emit photon of specific energy which relate to the difference in between the energy state see figure 1 a a result a theoretical understand of 𝑛 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑛 2 in equation 2 be developed in addition the significance of rydberg 's constant and it relation to other constant be acknowledge where 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of an electron e be the charge of an electron 𝜀 0 be the permittivity of free space h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light a diffraction grate consists of many closely space parallel slit appropriately monochromatic light strike the grate at normal incidence produce a diffraction pattern similar to that of a double slit but with significantly sharper and high peak intensity maximum like double slit maximum the condition for constructive interference be that the path difference see figure 2 be an integer multiple of wavelength where d be the slit space θ be the diffraction angle m ∈ ℕ be the order of the maximum and λ be wavelength blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk the aim of the experiment be to project light from a hydrogen lamp through a slit collimator diffraction grate and measure the diffraction angle of the maximum use equation 4 the wavelength of the project light can be obtain from the gradient of sin θ against m graph multiply by d. then by take 𝑛 1 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑛 2 3,4,5 for red blue purple spectrum line respectively a plot of 2 should yield a straight line through the origin therefore compare the gradient of the plot to 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 verifies the value of rydberg 's constant in this experiment the hydrogen lamp act a a light source the adjustable slit locate at the collimator focal point confines the source to a define narrow beam the collimator ensures all the light be parallel and therefore strike the diffraction grate at the same angle of incidence this allows a sharp image of the slit to be view use the telescope when it be focus at infinity the follow step be take to ensure the spectrometer be correctly align and focus firstly the hydrogen lamp be place in the centre of the slit about 1cm away such that the most intense illumination of the slit be achieve and care be take to not alter it position throughout the experiment so a to avoid introduce a large systematic error secondly the eye piece be slid forward and backwards until the cross hair come into sharp focus and their orientation be adjust so one of the line would not be parallel to a spectral line this be do to aid take precise measurement next the telescope be align with collimator meaning the cross hair be on the slit image by rotate the telescope arm 90°and use a mirror the position of the grate table at which the reflect the cross hair be center on the slit image be found consequently when the grate table be rotate back 45° the diffraction grate be perpendicular to the optical axis afterwards the telescope be use to check outer maximum be in plane define by the cross wire confirm that the grate ruling be in fact parallel to the telescope rotation axis prior to take definitive data a selection of preliminary data be take one measurement for each observable maximum be record for the red blue and purple spectral line while take measurement attention be paid to prevent potential parallax error by view the perpendicular to the vernier scale arbitrarily it be decide that all reading should be take from the right edge of the spectral line the centre be not use because it would introduce an uncertainty in judging it position it be notice also that light from desk lamp and the magnify glass be affect the image view in the telescope to try to reduce background illumination we surround the collimator section with black card grate of 80 and 300 line per mm be test and it be conclude despite limit the range of observable maximum the increase resolution of the observable maximum provide by the 300 line per mm would be most appropriate finally observable maximum would be record for the red blue and purple spectral line twice each and 3 repeat would be do for each measurement the experiment equipment be set up and procedure follow a described in the experimental setup and preliminary investigation section for each diffraction pattern sin θ where θ be the diffraction angle be plot against m the order of the maximum and a least square straight-line fit be implement for example see figure 4. there be random error in the angle reading associate with the ability to read the vernier scale by sample several people different reading of the same value the error be estimate to be 8 arc minute the random error associate with ambiguity when judging the right edge of spectral line be estimate by have the same person take a few reading of the same spectral line 4 arc minute furthermore it be assume an error associate with defocus and misalignment exist and be about 2 arc minute to obtain the total error on the diffraction angle these source of error be combine in quadrature the variable of sin θ be compute by multiply the total error on the diffraction angle by co θ evaluate at each diffraction angle there be no error on m because it can only take discrete value in an attempt to verify the value of rydberg 's constant inverse wavelength be plot against the difference between the inverse-square of the correspond energy state and a least straight-line fit be implement see figure 5 the variable error of inverse wavelength be determine by multiply the error of the wavelength by the inverse-square of the wavelength there be also no error n because accord to bohr 's model it can only take discrete value analysis of the least square straight-line fit yield a gradient of 10.92+-27 ×10 6 𝑚 −1 the theory suggests if balmer series hold true then the fit should be a straight line through the origin whose gradient be equal to rydberg 's constant 10 973 731.6 𝑚 a percentage difference of only 0.5 implies linearity between the variable in equation 2 and verifies the value of rydberg 's constant moreover the accepted value lie within the calculate error bound signify the investigate do not incur substantial systematic error although the error bound be not optimal and change could certainly be make to decrease major source of random error and incorporate one not previously address in conclusion the experimental value of rydberg 's constant calculate 10.92+-27 ×10 6 𝑚 −1 have a small percentage difference from the accepted value of 0.5 thus i propose the experiment verify the value but that adaptation to the method could be make the high resolution provide by the 300 line per mm grate help reduce error due to ambiguity judging the position of the right edge of spectral line however high order of maximum be very dim meaning we be only able only record value for maximum of order ≤ 3. to resolve this i suggest use a 100 or 200 line per mm grate instead so we could obtain a great range of maximum and while maintain a high resolution another potential downfall be prioritise measure more diffraction pattern limited how small our error could be in the future we could instead take more repeat reading at each value despite prevent some background illumination the black card surround the collimator section be not ideal cover the entire setup with a black cloth would far reduce background illumination a potential source of error that be not confront be the presence of very weak spectral line due transition of molecular hydrogen that can sometimes be observe between the red blue and purple line this be problem because it can be difficult to distinguish from between the spectral line of hydrogen and molecular hydrogen transition at high order maximum to highlight it ramification the experiment could be repeat use a hydrogen lamp of different age because a a tube age the emission from molecular hydrogen grow strong and the hydrogen line grow weaker v\"\n"," \"spectroscopy be one of the most powerful tool we have at our disposal today for research and be use in many field include quantum physic and astronomy it relies on the way electro-magnetic wave interact with matter and how different wavelength may be affected this set of experiment be do to familiarise ourselves with the spectrometer a piece of equipement that allows the user to see the different wavelength compose a ray of light on the first experiment discus in this report our goal be to determine the rydberg constant which be part of the equation describe the wavelength emit by a hydrogen atom the spectrometer be base on one basic physical phenomenon diffraction and interference when a wave go through a slit approximately a wide a the wavelength it get diffract meaning that a parallel beam will come out of the slit a a cone the interference happens when there be multiple slit or in the case of the spectrometer a grate with a large number of slit a show in figure 1 when look with a telescope at an angle θ from the grate what be see be a superposition of all the wave come from each slit in the grate a these wave originate all from the same source they be in phase at the grate and their difference of phase at the telescope depends on the difference of length of the path they be take they will interfere constructively when their path difference be a multiple of their wavelength and destructively when it be half the wavelength plus some multiple a show in figure 1 the path difference of two neighbour slit be give by d sin θ where d be the slit width in the grate the purpose of have a large number of slit be to create more discrete interference pattern and thus locate constructive interference more easily a a result of the above when a beam of wavelength λ be pas through the grate a constructive interference occurs whenever where m be an integer which we will refer to a the order of the constructive interference a such have precise knowledge of d and θ allows you to find λ and even more interestingly when passing a beam compose of multiple wavelength through the grate the constructive interference will occur for different θ allow u to clearly see the different ray in this experiment we look at the light emit by a hydrogen lamp unlike a common incandescent light bulb which emits a continuous spectrum of light through thermal emission a hydrogen lamp emits a discrete set of wavelength this be do by the excitation of the electron around a hydrogen atom when this electron go from a high level of energy to a low one the lose energy will be emit a a photon a the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom be quantise so be the energy of the photon that can be emit by use the formula relate the enrgy of a photon to it frequency e hν where e be the energy ν be the frequence and h be planck 's constant it be easy to see that the possible emission wavelength be also quantise these wavelength be give by where n and p be integer represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the electron r ∞ be the rydberg constant which we want to determine on the spectrometer the user be able to rotate the grate and the telescope with good precision the angle be give by a vernier scale with space of 1 arcminute we first setup the telescope to focus on a distant image a it would be receive a parallel beam and align it with the collimator wich would produce the beam use the crosshair in the telescope we then want to align the grate so we rotate the telescope by exactly 90 degree and place a mirror on the grate table we then shone a light through the collimator and turn the mirror in order to have the light arrive exactly on the crosshair at this point we knew that the mirror be at a 45 degree angle so we be able to turn everything precisely back in place to have it all align 0 degree everywhere we put the narrow slit we could between the hydrogen lamp and the collimator to obtain narrow ray in the interference pattern however we be meant to see three different ray compose the light and only two appear so we have to widen the slit when we take data for the third ray in order to have a visible intensity the experiment be do in this way the hydrogen lamp emits an orange light wich be compose of three different ray one red one blue and one violet and other high wavelength ray which we could not see for each ray we turn the telescope until we found a constructive interference note the order and the angle each time this would allow u to determine each wavelength and in turn the rydberg constant 4 data analysis when do the setup we align everything properly but instead of have everything to 0 degree we have an initial offset of 180 • 7 the width of the slit in the grate be d 1.27 × 10 5 the raw value we obtain be in table 1. figure 2 3 and 4 show this data when the offset be take out from equation 1 the gradient give u λ/d which then give u λ a d be know we found value of λ red 658 nm λ blue 486 nm λ v iolet 436 nm the rydberg constant can then be deduce from equation 2. for this it be give to u that the hydrogen atom always fall back to a state of p 2 and so these λ correspond to n 3 4 and 5. we find r ∞ 1.11 × 10 7 m 1 which be close to the know value 10 973 731.6 m 1 to estimate the error on the final value the error on the measurement be need first reading the vernier scale prove to be quite difficult with the tiny scale and the dim light so we take an error of ± 3 the ray have a width of 3 when look through the telescope so this give u an error of ± 1.5 the overall error on θ for the red and blue ray be hence give by √ 3 2 1.5 2 ≈ 4 ′ for the violet ray a we have to widen the slit in order to let in more light the width of the ray be 15 so the overall error on θ be ±8 ′ to find the error on the wavelength a the error for d the space in the grate be much small than the error on θ we only take the error on θ. the error of λ be then give by calculate it for each value of θ and then divide the mean by the square root of the number of data point a it be the mean of an error this give u σ λ red ±10nm σ λ blue ±10nm σ λ v iolet ±30nm the error for 1/λ be then give by and we then use again the same methos of the mean of an error to calculate the error on the rydberg constant give u in the end this experiment show u that the spectrometer be a quite precise instrument a we found value close to the know one the wavelength found for the hydrogen lamp be 658 nm 486 nm and 436 nm which be very close to the actual value of 656.3 486.1 and 434.0. the actual rydberg constant be within our error a we found which go to show how accurate this equipement can be when it be our first time use it and in non optimal condition extension number 2 of this set of experiment even show how we can know the composition of the sun just by look at the wavelength it emits by compare them to those of know element it be also this that have allow the scientific community to discover quantum mechanic a it be heavily involve in many pioneer experiment such a the photoelectric effect or compton scatter overall it be a very precise tool\"\n"," 'spectrometer be use to examine the spectrum of light emit by various source such a star crystal lamp an so on it be a very powerful tool a it give out data on multiple aspect of the light we make an attempt on measure the rydberg constant by follow the grate equation when light be pas through narrow slit diffraction occurs grate act a many narrow slit create many light beam with path difference which lead to phase difference these beam interact with each other create diffraction pattern maximum diffraction pattern happens when the phase difference be equal to integer multiple of 2π phase difference path difference ´2p l 2p m 1 1 where m be a integer also know a the order number λ be the wavelength of the light a show in where n be the number of slit when another light with different wavelength λ 2 be also pas through the slit a different diffraction pattern with maximum at different position be add to the imige now have two wavelength it can be deduce that then where dl be l -l 2 and be very small compare to λ. the rydberg constant r ¥ be give by 8 where n be initial state of the atom p be the final state of the atom which be all integer when atom be excite electron move to high energy state however it be less stable so they drop back to their ground state with a release of energy in the form of photon for hydrogen their ground state be p 2 and the electron be excite to different state to give out different wavelength of light fig 2 the setup of the spectrometer first focus the spectrometer to an object very far for example building out side the window put the grate in place very vertically and do not touch the grate itself then line up the light source in this case sodium lamp and hydrogen lamp with the collimator look into the eyepiece and adjust the width of the slit to be a small a possible but bright enough for the light to be observable after that make sure the crosshair be in the middle of the light beam and also the zero order of the light have no obvious split read and record the angle ±0.001° on the spectrometer then find the -2 order of the diffraction pattern aline the crosshair with one of the brightest colour observable record the angle and then turn to the next order until +2 order make sure to only work in one direction in order to avoid backlash the grate spectrometer 2 i. result first we try with sodium lamp however there be only one colour that be very bright so we only checked for symmetry to ensure that the spectrometer be correctly set up then the wavelength of the two colour can be determine by plot d sin θ against m accord to 4 the wavelength will be the gradient red the wavelength for red be 2.04e-04m the wavelength for blue be 2.76e-04m compare the two result to the wavelength of red light and blue light it be quite accurate'\n"," \"the rydberg constant be an important theoretical constant that can be use to predict the wavelength of light emit by various electron energy change that can occur when an atom contain a single electron becomes excite and then dexcites in order to measure this constant a gas discharge tube be use to excite hydrogen whose emission spectrum be then analyse use diffraction spectroscopy three emit wavelength be found in the visible spectrum and be found to be part of the balmer series of emission because they be produce by an electron fall from high energy state to a state with a quantum number of 2. the rydberg constant be found to be 1.088 ± 0.007 x10 7 m −1 which be an uncertainty of six part per thousand t he rydberg constant be a theoretical constant use to predict the wavelength of spectral emission line the constant and it 's associate formula be base on empirical data rather than from a theoretical approach spectral emission occurs when an electron move from a high energy state to a low one and emits the excess energy a a photon whose wavelength be function of the associate energy change the prediction make with the constant and formula use in this report be only valid for a atom with a single electron such a hydrogen the rydberg constant can also be express in term of fundamental constant this show how precise determination of the rydberg constant can help to accurately determine other constant in order to analyse the emission spectrum generate by a hydrogen lamp a grate spectrometer be employ this spectrometer be capable of splitting a beam of light into it component colour use the dispersion property of diffraction grate by investigate each colour in turn and analyse the relationship between their wavelength the rydberg constant can be found the hydrogen lamp use a a light source in this report be a gas discharge tube fill with hydrogen at a reduce pressure and one end there be a hot cathode which emits electron and at the other end be an anode which strip electron off the surround gaseous molecule charge particle be accelerate by the electric field create by the potential difference apply to the terminal of lamp because of the reduce pressure they can accelerate to sufficient energy so that when they collide with neutral gaseous molecule they can strip off electron to create more ion or transfer some of their kinetic energy to the electron of the neutral molecule transfer them from a low energy state to a high energy excite state when these electron return to their low energy state the excess energy be release a a photon of light similarly when positive ion recombine with electron excess energy be release a photon of light in an atom electron can only occupy discrete energy level particular to that atom therefore when an electron be excite there be a finite number of photon energy it can emit to reduce it energy state each element have a unique emission spectrum of possible photon wavelength with hydrogen have the simplest because there be few allow energy change correspond to light in the visible range the wavelength of these emit photon for hydrogen can be predict by where λ be the predict wavelength r h be the rydberg constant and n and p be positive integer correspond to the initial and final energy state of the electron respectively for all case of photon emission n p a the electron be transfer from a high energy to a low one by find a range of emit wavelength and determine their relevant n and p value through data analysis that rydberg constant can be found the light emit from the hydrogen lamp contains multiple wavelength of light when it be incident on the diffraction grate found in the grate spectrometer the light will be diffract so that intensity maximum for each wavelength appear accord to where d be the separation of slit on the diffraction grate θ be the angle relative to the normal at which the maximum occurs and m be a positive or negative integer correspond to the order of the maximum from this equation it be clear that the amount by which these component colour of light be diffract be a function of the light wavelength such that the gradient of a graph of sin θ against maximum order be equal to λ/d this show how a grate spectrometer be able to split up light into it various colour in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to analyse the emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp the lamp be place directly in front of the slit opening in the back of the spectrometer with the slit size reduce so that the spectral line be visible but a thin a possible in order to maximise the resolution of maximum location the light that enters the spectrometer be divergent so first pas through a collimator lens which directs the ray so that they be parallel once they leave the collimator the light be then incident onto a diffraction grate perpendicular to the light path this grate have a slit separation of 1.25 x10 −5 m. once light pas through the grate each component colour diffracts so that maximum appear accord to equ 3 the telescope of the grate spectrometer can move so it be at a constant distance from and always look directly at the centre of the diffraction grate for each colour in turn the telescope swept across the area in which the maximum could be observe note the angle reading on the vernier scale resolution of 1 arcminute when the crosshair in the centre of the eyepiece mount on the end of the telescope be at the centre of the maximum line the movement be do in such a way that the telescope do not have to change direction in between measurement to prevent mechanical backlash the hydrogen lamp be switch off while measurement be take place to reduce an effect that the heating of the lamp my have and also prevent damage to the lamp the order of maximum can be determine by compare their position to the position of the central maximum which can be easily identify because at this point every component colour will also have their central maximum value of θ at each maximum be found by take the difference between the angle reading at this maximum and the angle reading at the central maximum use the relationship described in equ 3 the wavelength of each colour can then be found the value for n and p for each wavelength can be found through reason and analysis of the data primarily use the fact that if wavenumber 1/λ be plot on 1/n 2 -1/p 2 then a perfectly negative linear relationship with gradient equal to -r h be expect to be found once p and n be determine for each value of λ r h can be determine only three district wavelength of light be found in the visible range they have wavelength of 647 ± 3 nm 482 ± 0.5 nm and 431 ± 0.4 nm these wavelength be found from the gradient of fig 2. multiply by the slit separation d. in order to far analyse this data two assume have to be make firstly the observe light have the same value of p this be valid because change the value of p would incur such a large change in λ that it would cause it to fall out of the visible range secondly that the n value of the observe emit light be consecutive this be valid because there be no intermediate wavelength of light detect it can also be deduce that the long wavelength of light be emit from the low change in energy so must correspond to the small value of n. fig 3. show the cast of λ value on to various series of increase n if the cast be correct then the gradient should the vernier scale use to measure the position of the telescope this scale be part of the mechanism that allows the telescope to rotate about the centre of the spectrometer while the other element stay fix 2. the telescope

calculate by combine the gradient and intercept model the value of n to be 3,4 and 5 yield the high pcc value on average 0.16 high than with the other n value the be also the only set of n value that yield an approximately integer value of p found to be 2 to 2sf make the observe emission line part of the balmer series which support this be the with the value of p and n finalise it can be state that the rydberg constant be found to be 1.088 ± 0.007 x10 7 m −1 the uncertainty be estimate by combine the percentage uncertainty of the wavenumber value in quadrature this be comparable to the accepted value of 1.097 x10 7 m −1 which lie just outside of the uncertainty of this report this report be carry out in a darken room with no fluctuate light source such a outside light the body of the hydrogen lamp almost entirely shield the spectrometer opening from background light and the relevant intensity of this ambient light when compare to the intensity of the hydrogen lamp be so much low that it can be consider to be negligible hence any possible interference effect have be ignore in the data analysis while set up the grate spectrometer the angle between the plane of the diffraction grate and the incident light be set to 90 • the possible effect of misalignment have not be take into account because if equ 3 be expand to include this factor then where θ i be the angle between the incident light and the normal to the diffraction grate a it can be see when λ be determine from the gradient of a graph such a fig 2. θ i will only effect the intercept so will have no impact on the result in analysis θ i can therefore be ignore while collect result the hydrogen lamp be only left on for a few second at at time to prevent damage and reduce any possible build up of heat with could effect the data such a by change the refractive index of surround air enough that the wavelength of light be noticeably change cause slight deformation in the optical element due to their expansion under heat or by difference in refractive index be great enough to scatter the light so that the collimator be n't sufficient to make the light ray parallel none parallel light ray would mean that light incident on the diffraction grate would have a range of θ i and in accordance with equ 4 the spectral line would broaden and cause the uncertainty in the location of each maximum to change the experiment be carry out at room temperature however change in ambient heat or other atmospheric condition such a air pressure and humidity which be not quantify during the experiment throughout the experiment could not be control and be not measure hence the magnitude of any possible effect be not know v. conclusion the goal of this experiment be to measure the rydberg constant by invest the spectral emission of hydrogen use a grate spectrometer it be found that in the visible range the emission spectrum of hydrogen contains three separate wavelength which through analysis be determine to be part of the balmer series of spectral line the rydberg constant be found to be 1.088 ± 0.007 x10 7 m −1 in order to more precisely state this much more measurement would need to take and compile to reduce random error additionally a diffraction grate with a much small slit separation would allow many more maximum to be observe and far reduce error in far measurement the effect of change in atmospheric condition should also be investigate such a by take preliminary data at temperature and condition across the range that could be expect to occur during the full experiment to investigate the effect and incorporate them into the state uncertainty with this data it could also be decide if far step to control atmospheric condition should be take\"\n"," \"a spectrometer be use to analyse the emission spectrum of a sample of hydrogen three spectral line be analyse and rydberg 's constant be measure to be 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 furthermore it be show that the emission be most likely those of the balmer series produce by electron fall to the n=2 state from high energy level a second experiment be also conduct in which a spectrum be produce by a white lead nichia 713-3955 a continuous spectrum be observe and image take in order to discern how the lead produce this and the nature of the spectrum t he most simple quantise model of the atom be the bohr model of hydrogen in which a single electron be consider to orbit a proton bound entirely by the coulomb force 1 in this model we consider the quantise nature of electron energy level such that only distinct and discrete wavelength of electromagnetic radiation can be absorbed or emit by an atom these wavelength be unique to a particular atom or molecule and can therefore be use to identify matter present in object such a star or mixture of gas and theirs property in this way spectrometry can be use to study fundamental interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter in a similar way to in atom lead function by the stimulate movement of electron between artificial energy level within the lead structure such that the electron emit photon 2 thus information on structure of an lead could be discern by perform spectrometry on it emission spectrum figure 1 show how light diffracts through a diffraction grate where the path difference between adjacent beam to any point on the screen be give by dsin θ where d be the distance between adjacent slit and θ be the angle subtend by a diffract ray and the displacement between the grate and the screen for the wave to interfere constructively this path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength λ thus we find the relation where n be the order of the maximum an experimental set up like that in figure 2 be use circle graduate in degree with a minimum angular resolution of 1 arcminute the spectrometer be calibrate by set the telescope cross-hair directly on the open slit with a test bright light source behind it before insert the grate the telescope be rotate at 90 • to the collimator a mirror be insert into the grate turntable and rotate so that light be reflect from the collimator into the telescope at this point the mirror be at 45 • to the light beam the mirror be then replace with the diffraction grate and rotate 45 • to make it perpendicular to the collimator the telescope be then rotate 90 • back to face the collimator the diffraction grate use have 300 line per millimetre a this be the only grate which allow the m red ±2 and m violet ±3 maximum to be easily distinguish but still provide enough visible order such that a mean and error could be calculate measurement be take anticlockwise from the high order maximum on the left to that on the right in order to avoid any mechanical inconsistency that my be present in the device if the direction of rotation be alternate the high order maximum that could be see clearly be m blue 3 and m blue −3 with angle from the central maximum of 25.93 • and −25.08 • respectively in order to maximise precision the slit be close until the maximum furthest from the centre be just visible this meant that the cross-hair be always centre on the fringe reduce the error in the fringe 's position and that adjacent fringe would be less likely to interfere or obscure each other the high order maximum for the red emission line be 2 and -2 a any high order maximum be likely too dim with the slit at a width small enough to provide adequate precision the measure result can be see in table i where the error be determine a the minimum resolution of the spectrometer 1 arcminute instead of half that a the measurement depend on an initial measurement of the location of the central maximum a can be see the angle be symmetric around the central maximum but all positive order of maximum have angle away from the centre that be large than their negative counterpart this would seem to imply that the diffraction grate be not set up perfectly perpendicular to the incident light beam alternatively the actual position of the central maximum could have be measure inaccurately however this seem less likely a the inconsistency be a high a 0.32 • an order of magnitude large than the resolution of the device in the case of m blue ±1 the average wavelength associate with the angle in table i can be see in table ii error be calculate use equation 2 where σ m be the standard error on the mean s be the standard deviation of the value use to calculate the mean and x be the number of value use to calculate the mean the measure wavelength mostly align with those measure for the balmer series of hydrogen emission line on the order of 655nm for red 485nm for blue and 433nm for violet 3 there be a noticeable difference of around 10nm between the measure violet wavelength and the accepted one it could be that whatever error present in the set up which cause the asymmetry in table i be intensified at small wavelength a small difference in slit width and angle will have a large contribution to this small value of λ. the similarity between our measurement and those of the balmer series implies that electron be fall to the n= 2 electron quantum state from the bohr model of the hydrogen atom we find where r h be the rydberg constant for hydrogen n be the low energy electron quantum number and p be the high energy electron quantum number the full derivation of this can be found in appendix a 1 it be interest to note that this equation only describes atom or ion with a single electron a multiple electron will interact with each other however for nucleus with more than one proton the rydberg constant will have a different value scale by the increase in charge of the nucleus a it have be establish that the measure wavelength be most like those of the balmer series then n 2 and p 3 4 5 for the red blue and violet emission line respectively note that the energy level of the emission line must be consecutive else other emission line would be see furthermore a the the energy of the photon be described by where h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light a large difference in energy level corresponds to a small wavelength λ. for each of the wavelength an average value of r h be calculate and can be see in table iii this give an average value of r h of 1.09±0.01×10 7 with all error calculate use equation 2. the accepted value for r h be 1.10 × 10 7 therefore our measure value be in concurrence with this 3 it may be of interest to compare this data to different assumption of the n electron energy level a such the possibility must be consider that n could be high or low than n 2. a can be see the assumption of the n 3 or n 4 state produce line that be quite clearly not horizontal have gradient an order of magnitude large than that of n 1 or n 2. from comparison with other measure value of the balmer series n 2 it be clear that the measure wavelength be those of the balmer series however this be not necessarily clear from the figure 4 a n 1 and n 2 have gradient of similar order of magnitude although the gradient for n 2 be indeed closer to 0 it be not significantly closer furthermore the error in n 1 be significant compare to it value around 35 this be likely due to the afore mention deviation of the violet emission line wavelength form it expect value a such more data would be require to prove that electron be fall to the n 2 state a set up like that in the previous experiment be use see fig 2 with the 300 line per millimetre diffraction grate replace with a 100 line per millimetre grate and a camera use to take image through the eyepiece 4 this be do to allow the entire spectrum to be visible at once a see through the eyepiece so that it could then be photograph and the intensity across wavelength plot a nichia model 713-3955 white lead be use in place of the hydrogen lamp a scan 90 • clockwise and anticlockwise from the central maximum be make to give a qualitative understand of the diffraction pattern interestingly it be observe that the spectrum of the lead be entirely continuous this can be see in figure 5 with no clear vertical line correspond to specific emission line this be entirely contradictory to the idea that this lead work use artificial energy level within the material alone to generate light a a set of energy level span a range must be produce such that the difference in energy between subsequent energy level be small enough to produce a spectrum that appear continuous furthermore each energy level will have a different threshold voltage meaning that one could activate only low energy emission of red light with a sufficiently low voltage this however be not observe and the lead turn on sharply at 2.66 ± 0.005v a such it seem reasonable to assume that the lead itself produce a high energy wavelength for example ultraviolet and this be absorbed by a phosphor coat and re-emitted in the visible range horizontal line can be observe on the spectrum however this be determine to be cause by dust within the slit on the collimator block some of the incident light a far issue exist in that order of maximum high than the first order be see to overlap fig 5. two image be take of the spectrum with the camera centre on the blue region and the red region respectively this be do to hopefully remove some of the camera 's bias towards certain colour or object in certain position the angle away from the central maximum of the red and blue boundary can be see in table v and the intensity plot of each can be see in figure 6 and 7. interestingly it can be see that there be clear saturation of the detect intensity between a distance of 300 and 500 pixel on both figure 6 and 7. the wavelength in this interval correspond to the range 470nm to 520nm this fact alone implies that this camera be unsuitable for this purpose a either the detector or some aspect of it internal processing contains a bias towards certain wavelength in the visible a such in order to conduct this aspect of the experiment effectively an unbiased camera must be found and utilised in this paper a spectrometer be use to analyse the spectrum emit by a hydrogen lamp and a nichia 713-3955 white lead in order to discern a deeper understand of the structure present in each source first the spectrum of hydrogen be analyse and be found to contain three distinct emission line red blue and violet with respective wavelength of 652 ± 3nm 482 ± 11nm and 449 ± 3nm it be found that these wavelength be most similar to those of the hydrogen balmer series with the only measurement deviate from the accepted value be that of the violet measurement this deviation be likely due to asymmetry cause by error in calibration however far data should be take to confirm this from these wavelength measurement the average of rydberg 's constant be calculate to be 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 with the accepted value value be 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 3 far analysis be conduct under the assumption that the emission line see be not those of the balmer series figure 4 and table iv provide the predict value of r h associate with an emission line for a possible value of n. a rydberg 's constant should be the same for all wavelength the gradient of the line should be 0. it be found that the assumption of the n 3 or n 4 state produce line that be quite clearly not horizontal have gradient an order of magnitude large than that of n 1 or n 2. from the calculate gradient table iv it can be see that n 1 and n 2 produce gradient on the same order of magnitude a such more data would have to be collect in order to verify that this be the balmer series the lead spectrum be analyse and qualitatively it be notice that the observe spectrum be continuous contradict the expectation that the lead produce light in a way similar to that of other lead by stimulate movement of electron between distinct energy level a the difference in energy between consecutive energy level would have to be small enough such that it could not be notice this seem like an unlikely design instead it seem more reasonable that the lead be cover by a phosphor coat which absorbs a small set of high energy wavelength and emits a continuous spectrum in the visible an attempt at a more quantitative analysis of the spectrum be make use image take on the camera of an iphone 7 however on far inspection of the data fig 6 and 7 it be see that the camera or processing within the device contain clear bias towards certain wavelength make the data fundamentally untrustworthy for this aspect of the experiment to be conduct successfully it would be necessary to utilise an entirely unbiased light photo-detector or camera mount to the spectrometer telescope to maximise stability the rydberg equation be where r h be the rydberg constant n be the low energy electron quantum number and p be the high energy electron quantum state to derive this we imagine a hydrogen atom in which a single electron be in a circular orbit of radius r of a single proton the total energy e held by the electron can be represent by the sum of it potential and kinetic energy a the only significant potential be electric potential then where e be the magnitude of the charge of the electron k be the coulomb constant m be the mass of the electron v be the electron 's velocity and r be the distance between the proton and the electron next we consider the electron to be orbit the proton thus the centripetal force f c be described by from this we find for the energy of a photon release from an electron move from energy level f=p to energy level f=n where p¿n and n and p be integer then therefore where mek 2 e 4 4πh 3 r h be the rydberg constant for hydrogen\"\n"," \"in the experiment conduct we calculate with an error of three part per thousand the rydberg constant this constant appear in rydberg 's formula and relates the inverse of the wavelength of emit light to the fundamental quantum number of the orbitals involve in the emission we calculate the value of the rydberg constant to be 𝑅 ∞ 1.099 • 10 7 ± 3 • 10 4 𝑚 −1 agree with the accepted value which be to four significant figure 1.097 • 10 7 𝑚 −1 1 to obtain the data necessary for the calculation we use a hydrogen discharge lamp observe it spectrum with an optical spectrometer and measure the angular position of the spectral line of three different colour with respect to the central maximum we then compare the result for the light wavelength obtain by plot the angular position against the order number with the know value for the correspond fundamental quantum number for the hydrogen pectrometry be a non-invasive technique that allows u to determine the chemical composition of an object by study the spectrum of the light it emits to obtain spectrum the light emit be separate into an array of different colour that can be observe use a spectrometer this technique find many research application especially in astronomy the composition of a distant astronomical object can be deduce from it radiation 2 one important relationship in spectrometry be the rydberg formula which express the behaviour of spectral line and be found empirically the constant that appear in the formula also name after rydberg can be express in term of fundamental constant the most general formulation of the relationship be first publish in 1888 by johannes rydberg a swedish physicist who start his career a an amanuensis the theoretical justification of his work be provide in 1913 by niels bohr who propose a model of the atom with electron orbit around the nucleus on quantise energy level 3 bohr 's work show that rydberg 's formula relates the fundamental quantum number of the energy level from and to which an orbit electron drop emit energy in the form of light and the wavelength of the light emit 3 the aim of this experiment be to measure rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer we use a hydrogen gasdischarge lamp a a source of light and register the angular position of the light fringe use an optical spectrometer from these measurement we be able to calculate the wavelength of the different colour of the fringe and therefore obtain a value for the rydberg 's constant a diffraction grate have equally space slit that be parallel and identical to each other and give an interference pattern with very narrow maximum this enables more precise measurement of the angular position of the maximum than could be obtain use a setup with few slit a series of fringe call balmer series can be observe with a spectrometer if a hydrogen lamp be place in front of it grate the band of each colour correspond to the maximum of the diffraction pattern and repeat several time at different angular position identify by an order number m a show in fig 1. the order number the angle θ relative to the position 0 th order at which a fringe can be found and the wavelength of the colour observe be related through the path difference 2 for light of wavelength λ a phase difference between neighbour ray of integer multiple of 2π determines a principal maximum the relationship between the phase difference δϕ and the path difference δx be give by where m be the order number a show in fig 2. the path difference be ∆𝑥 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 2 where d be the separation between the slit of the grate combine equation 1 and 2 it follow that the relationship 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑚𝜆 3 hold 4 the rydberg constant s fig 2. a diagram show the difference in path length δx between two adjacent ray this distance be equal to dsinθ where d be the slit separation and θ be the grate angle a different expression for the wavelength be give by an empirical formula found by the swiss physicist johann balmer in 1855 later generalise by rydberg 5 the more general formulation be where r∞ be the rydberg constant n and p be integer and represent respectively the energy level of the initial and final state of the electron that emits the light the rydberg constant can be express use fundamental constant by look at the energy of the photon that result from the transition of an electron between different energy level in the hydrogen atom a described by bohr 's model the energy of this photon be in absolute value equal to the difference δe in internal energy of the two energy level involve and can be express use einstein 's light quantisation a where h be the planck constant and c be the speed of light in vacuum 6 the difference in internal energy can also be express in term of the energy of initial and final energy level the energy of these state can be write a the sum of their potential energy pe and kinetic energy ke and where e be the charge of the electron r be the radius of the atomic orbit me be the mass of the electron and v be it velocity 5 substitute bohr 's radius and the speed of the orbit electron see equation 11 and 12 in appendix into equation 6 the energy can be express a where n represent the initial energy level similarly the same result can be found for the final energy with p represent the final energy level the difference in internal energy can now be write a equate equation 5 and 10 rydberg 's formula can be write a therefore the rydberg 's constant can be write a the set-up of the spectrometer use in this experiment be show in fig 3. after focus the eyepiece on the crosswire at roughly 30 centimetre to avoid eye strain we focus the camera lens of the optical spectrometer on an object distant nearly 10 metre which be a good approximation of focus on infinity we then position the lamp close to the slit to adjust the focus of the collimator and clamped the telescope at 90° to be able to put the grate at exactly 45° use a mirror for this experiment we use a diffraction grate with 300 slit to minimise systematic error we make sure that all the component be well align use a sodium lamp that unlike the hydrogen lamp do not need to be turn off often to avoid overheat to be able to see the spectrum clearly we kept our desk lamp off for the entire duration of the experiment for the experiment we use a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp a the source of light we turn it off between measurement to avoid overheat we first measure the width of the central maximum a a reference value for the width of the spectral line to be approximately 4 we then take two measurement of angular position relative to the central maximum for each colour band we be able to see position the crosswire approximately on the centre of the fringe the error on these reading due to the difficulty to clearly identify the centre of very dim fringe be estimate to be 1 the error on the reading on the vernier scale of the spectrometer be of 1 we plot the sine of the measure angular position against the order number of the fringe for each of the colour observe red blue and violet we verify that for every colour the relationship between the two variable follow the linear correlation expect a show if fig 4. we be able to see three order of line for the red and blue light but only two for the violet one the three line meet in a common point that corresponds to the central maximum namely the 0 th order the error on the fit line for the three colour show in fig 3 be express in table 1. the error on the single data point be calculate consider the error on the reading on the vernier scale and the estimate error on the position of the centre of the fringe these error on the fitting line be calculate use the covariance matrix use equation 3 in the form where d be the separation between two consecutive slit and we calculate wavelength for the three set of line observe the value obtain for the wavelength and the correspond fundamental quantum number of the initial energy level be set out in table 2. the value for the fundamental quantum number n represent the initial energy level be obtain from the know value correspond to the wavelength measure 1 use equation 4 we calculate a value for the rydberg constant for each of the colour know that the fundamental quantum number p correspond to the energy level to which the electron drop be 2 for the three case 1 take the average of the three value calculate for the constant we obtain our final result of 1.099•10 7 m -1 with an error of 3•10 4 m -1 this error arises from the error calculate on the three individual value that depend on the limitation of the equipment our ability to identify the centre of the line and on the precision of the fit function all the error be determine use the standard formula of error analysis 8 this report review the process involve in calculate rydberg 's constant with small systematic error observe with a spectrometer the spectral line generate by a hydrogen lamp and measure their angular position relative to the central maximum plot these measurement against the order number of the colour band we obtain a value for the wavelength of the different colour use the wavelength value we be able to determine the fundamental quantum number of the orbital involve in the emission of light by compare our result with the know value for the hydrogen atom energy level finally we use rydberg 's formula and obtain a mean value of 1.099•10 7 m -1 for the rydberg constant this result agrees with the accepted value of 1.097•10 7 m -1 1 which lie within our error range to minimise systematic error the alignment of the component of the equipment be carefully set up and the influence of background illumination reduce a much a possible a it cause the line to be difficult to observe other possible source of error we identify be the dimness of high order spectral line the possible defocus of the equipment and random error that could be reduce by take more measurement the experiment present in this report could be extend by use different light source to verify the rydberg formula for other element rather than hydrogen appendix bohr 's radius 𝑟 0 𝜀 0 ℎ

\"an investigation be undertaken with the aim of measure the visible balmer transition wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum in order to deduce an estimate of the rydberg constant r∞ this be do use simple spectrometry the light from a hydrogen lamp be pas through a 300lines/mm diffraction grate and the diffraction angle θ be measure a graph of sin θ against order m allow the wavelength of the first 3 transition to be determine and this in turn allow the rydberg constant r∞ to be measure to a high accuracy and precision the final estimate for the rydberg constant be r∞ 1.097 ± 0.004 10 7 m −1 this be in agreement with the accepted value r∞ 10973731.6m −1 to four significant figure spectrometry of light be arguably the most important technique in all of astronomy without the ability to analyse the incoming light from distant cosmic object it would not be possible to verify the theory of the universe on a large scale spectrometry have help to improve our understand of many area of modern physic for example the formation and structure of star and galaxy the study of earth-like planet and other stellar orbit object and our understand of relativity this report detail an investigative effort into the measurement of rydberg 's constant this be do use a light spectrometer consist of a hydrogen lamp and a collimator which produce a parallel beam of light this beam then pas through a diffraction grate and produce a diffraction pattern this diffraction pattern can be measure by a camera/eyepiece set up which be attach to a freely rotate table the measurement of different colour of light at different diffraction angle allows for the determination of wavelength and hence of the rydberg constant when an electric current be pas through a glass tube which contains low pressure hydrogen gas it emits light consist of various different wavelength 1 when this light be pas through a diffraction grate it be separate into it individual component wavelength which build up an emission spectrum an emission spectrum consists of a few bright colour line against a black backdrop see figure 2 these line correspond to the different wavelength of light emit by the source these wavelength be distinct and demonstrate quantisation in the structure of the atom in fact these wavelength be a result of an electron fall from an excite state to a low energy state figure 1 demonstrates some of these transition in hydrogen the transition demonstrate here belong to the balmer series which consists of the transition from high energy level to the 2nd energy level n=2 when an electron transition from a high energy level to a low one it release energy in the form of a photon the amount of energy carry by this photon be exactly equal to the difference between the two energy level the wavelength of this photon be related to this energy difference by the follow formula where e=transition energy h=planck 's constant 6.626 ... 10 −34 j c=speed of light in a vacuum 2.997 ... 10 8 m −1 and λ=wavelength of light emit the transition wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum be also give by equation 1 below here rather than require the energy difference between the two energy state the quantum number of the initial state and the final state be need this property make the equation incredibly powerful and work extremely well for hydrogen 's emission spectrum but can also be use for some large atom the constant in this equation be call the rydberg constant where λ wavelength n initial state of excite electron p final state of de-excited electron and r ∞ the rydberg constant the visible wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum the balmer series wavelength can be predict by set the final energy level p 2 and the initial energy level n 3 4 5 .... the first three balmer transition spectral line can be see in figure 2 below along with the expect wavelength energy level to the 2nd energy level these wavelength be in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to measure the rydberg constant via equation 1 the wavelength of each spectral line be need in order to measure these wavelength a light spectrometer be use this spectrometer consist of 4 main component a hydrogen lamp act a a light source the light from the hydrogen lamp be pas through a slit and a collimator in series to produce a parallel thin beam of light this thin beam be pas through a 300lines/mm diffraction grate in order to separate the light into it component wavelength a camera/eyepiece set up sat on table which be free to rotate about a vertical axis that pas through the centre of the diffraction grate by rotate the camera/eyepiece the angle θ between the central maximum and increase order maximum of different colour be measure the rotate table be fit with a vernier scale which allow the measurement of this angle θ to arcminute precision within 1/60 of a degree a simple schematic of the set up can be see in figure 3 below simple diffraction theory state that different wavelength be diffract by different amount when pas through the diffraction grate this be the reason that the component wavelength be split up to produce an emission spectrum like the one demonstrate in figure 2. the angle θ by which a particular wavelength be diffract be related to the wavelength by the follow equation where m=order of maximum λ=wavelength d=grating space and θ=diffraction angle this meant that plot a graph of sin θ against the order m result in a straight line with the gradient equal to λ d therefore by use this simple set up and measure the diffraction angle at increase order maximum for the various different colour it be possible to measure the wavelength of each of those colour and hence calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ via equation 1 the hydrogen lamp use provide a stable light source from which the emission spectrum of hydrogen could be investigate the dependent variable be the angle θ between the central maximum and the m'th maximum for each colour of light observe red blue and violet preliminary measurement reveal that the vernier scale on the rotate table be sometimes difficult to read exactly a it be n't always obvious which line on the scale be align perfectly also whilst each spectral line be relatively thin there be some uncertainty in the position of it center it be decide that to compensate for these two source of error an uncertainty of ±5 arcsecond be appropriate in each measure value of the angle θ. this be still a small percentage uncertainty in the order of 0.5 or less meaning that the precision be still high by plot graph of sin θ against m the wavelength of each colour be estimate by refer back to equation 2 it can be see that λ measure d gradient this be consistent with the data collect a the red line have the great gradient whilst the violet line have the small see figure 4 use this relation and the value of d 1/300000 m an estimate for the wavelength of each observe spectral line be calculate the uncertainty in the gradient of each line be extract from the the respective covariant matrix this carry forward the ±5 arcsecond error estimate earlier into an uncertainty in the value of the gradient since d 1/300000 m be constant the measure wavelength λ be only dependent on the gradient it can be easily verify use quadrature that the percentage uncertainty in λ be equal to the percentage uncertainty in the gradient use a rearrange form of equation 1 allow the calculation of the rydberg constant r ∞ from each of the three observe spectral line in this case p 2 and n 3 4 5 for the red blue and violet line respectively since p and n be definite and without error the rydberg constant have an uncertainty which depend only on λ. that uncertainty could be easily calculate in quadrature to be equal to the percentage uncertainty in the value of λ. the result from the first three wavelength in the emission spectrum of hydrogen can be see in table 1 below from these result an average value of the rydberg constant r ∞ be calculate along with it associate uncertainty use quadrature this final estimate in the value of the rydberg constant be this result be very accurate agree with the accepted value r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 to four significant figure the percentage uncertainty in the final estimate be just 0.36 which show that the result colour λ/nm r ∞ 10 7 m −1 red 656 ± 5 1.098 ± 0.009 blue 485 ± 3 1.100 ± 0.007 violet 436 ± 2 1.092 ± 0.005 table 1 a table show the measure wavelength λ and the correspond value of the rydberg constant r∞ from these result an average value of r∞ be calculate along with it associate uncertainty use quadrature be also very precise all in all this demonstrates that a very simple spectrometer set up can be use to make high precision measurement to far improve the precision of this experiment one could take more time to collect repeat result of the angle θ observe for each spectral line and hence reduce the uncertainty in the measure angle this would propagate into a small uncertainty in the gradient and hence a small uncertainty in the final estimate of r ∞ this would result in a more precise measurement accurate to a great number of significant figure furthermore one could change the diffraction grate use to collect data for different value of the grate space d. do this several time would allow the wavelength of each spectral line to be calculate multiple time and hence an average wavelength could be calculate for each spectral line which would reduce the standard error on the wavelength and propagate into a small error in the final estimate of r ∞ another possible improvement lie in the fact that background light from desk lamp and computer screen make it difficult to see any maximum beyond m ±3 it would be possible to reduce the background light to zero by conduct the experiment in a photographic darkroom and turn off all light source include desk lamp and computer screen during measurement take this would allow data to be take for higher-order maximum which would in turn allow a high number of data point in the sin θ vs. m graph in turn the uncertainty in the gradient would be reduce and hence result in a more precise estimate of r ∞ the reduction in background light could also allow the measurement of low wavelength spectral line by go beyond the first three balmer series transition and substitute n 6 into equation 1 it can be see that there should be a far violet colour spectral line of wavelength λ 410nm in the initial investigation this spectral line be not visible probably due to low intensity and too much background light however this wavelength still lie within the visible spectrum and hence technically it could be observe use the same equipment 4 this would allow an extra value of the rydberg constant to be measure and would allow the calculation of an average use a great number of measurement reduce the standard error on the mean value of r ∞ and increase the ultimate precision lastly the error on the angle θ measure at each maximum could be reduce by use a rotate table with a digital scale rather than the analogue vernier scale on the exist table this would greatly reduce the previously estimate uncertainty of ±5 arcsecond and hence reduce the error which be propagate into the final result again this would lead to a more precise value of r ∞ the aim of this investigation be to gain an estimate for the rydberg constant r ∞ use simple spectrometry of light this aim be successfully met and the rydberg constant be measure to be r ∞ 1.097 ± 0.004 10 7 m −1 this agree with the accepted value of r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 to four significant figure demonstrate the high accuracy and precision of the method involve with some minor tweak and more time the method could be improve to reduce uncertainty in turn this would lead to an increase the precision of the experiment and allow the measurement of the rydberg constant to a great number of significant figure\"\n"," \"in 1911 neils bohr use quantum theory to explain the discrete line spectrum produce by radiation emit from atom 1 his model of the atom developed on the work do by rutherford which show the scatter of 𝛼 particle by nucleus he postulate that the atom consist of a dense positive nucleus surround by negative electron in discrete stable energy state orbit the nucleus in circular path although the orbit of electron around nucleus be elliptical and not specifically circular bohr 's prediction of the discrete energy of the electron be accurate in our experiment we use the relationship between transition energy of electron and the frequency of emit photon to measure the wavelength of light in the balmer series use a grate spectrometer with this we can experimentally verify the rydberg formula and retrieve an accurate value for 𝑅 the bohr model of the atom be a positively charge nucleus surround by shell of negatively charge electron the electron in different level shell have discrete energy where the potential energy in the 𝑛 level be give by 1 1 where 𝑍 be the atomic number 𝑚 7 be the electron mass 𝑒 be the electron charge 𝜖 a be the permittivity of free space and ℎ be planck 's constant electron can be excite to high level if expose to light radiation when they fall back to their original level their potential energy decrease and a photon of equal energy be release a the difference in energy for different level be discrete the energy of emit photon be discrete thus produce a distinct emission spectrum for the element in question the balmer series for hydrogen consists of the spectral emission line that be the result of electron fall to the second level 2 fig 1. demonstrates the balmer transition for the wavelength of light in the visible spectrum wavelength in the balmer series follow the relationship 2 know a the rydberg formula where 𝜆 be the wavelength of light emit 𝑅 be the rydberg constant 𝑝 be 2 and 𝑛 be the level at which the electron orbit the nucleus the energy of emit photon in this process be equal to where 𝑐 be the speed of light and 𝜆 𝜈 be the wavelength and frequency of the emit light respectively a this be equal to the change in energy of the electron when fall from the 𝑛 level to the 𝑝 level we can derive equation 4 by equate equation 2 and 3 rearrange this give the rydberg formula for the spectrum of hydrogen which describes the transition wavelength of light emit experimental verification of rydberg 's constant rydberg constant be 10,973,731 𝑚 c 6 which fall in the bound of the experimentally calculate value therefore we have successfully verify the value of the rydberg constant when calculate the wavelength of the light spectrum we must consider the error in the measure angle 𝜃 and the slit width of the grate 𝑑. the error in the angle measure be take to be ± 0.5 arcsecond the instrument resolution of the vernier scale therefore the error in sin 𝜃 𝜎 opq r can be calculate use equation 8 7 the manufacturer 's value for 𝑑 be 80 line per 𝑚𝑚 however the old imperial definition of unit be use where 2001 line per 𝑚𝑚 actually approximates to 78.8 line per 𝑚𝑚 so we use value instead 3 a no error be give by the manufacturer an estimate of ± 2 be use the error in 𝜆 be dependent on the error in the gradient of fig 5 calculate in python and the error in 𝑑 a these error be uncorrelated they add in quadrature 8 to give the error in 𝜆 𝜎 d described by equation 9 where 𝜎 d and 𝜎 z be the error in 𝑑 and the gradient respectively the large source of error in our experiment come from trouble in determine at which point the crosshair intersect the fringe particularly for high order of 𝑚. however the method use to properly align the spectrometer meant there be no other noticeable systematic error in our reading for 𝜃. the balmer series for the emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp be measure use a grate spectrometer the

partner with a diffraction grate be use to observe the hydrogen emission spectrum the angle of diffraction for the different colour line be calculate with a high precision scale hence the error be small the data reading for the violet emission line be inaccurate whilst red and turquoise agree with the theory for both wavelength and the rydberg constant have the same order of magnitude t he swedish physicist johannes rydberg devise the rydberg formula in 1888 to explain the observe feature of atomic spectrum 1 from this formula arose the fundamental physical constant-the rydberg constant-as for each emission spectrum he study the constant in the formula stayed the same 1 what make the rydberg constant special be that it can be define in term of other fundamental constant a will be show in equation 3 the rydberg constant can be use to work out the wavelength of an emit photon in an element from a certain energy level hence it be use in spectroscopy and have played a major role in atomic physic 2 spectroscopy have many application in modern astronomy such a obtain data about the composition density and temperature of a certain astronomical object 3 spectroscopy have be significant in the improvement of our knowledge about the solar system for this experiment the light emit from the hydrogen lamp be separate by a diffraction grate where the apparatus the light travel through be call the spectrometer the main apparatus use for this experiment be the spectrometer show in fig 1. it work by have a light source 's ray travel through an adjustable narrow slit follow by a collimator to make the ray parallel 4 the light then pas through the diffraction grate to disperse the light into distinct spectral line observe through the eyepiece a first postulate by niels bohr the emission spectrum observe be compose of distinct line since the different colour of light have different wavelength and so be diffract different amount 1 they have different wavelength a inside the atom after an electron have be excite it fall down from a discrete energy level give off a photon of discrete energy depend on the level transition 1 the combination of photon emit from different level combination form the emit light detailed draw of a spectrometer that consists of a collimator grate table and telescope it show how the light be collimate diffract and then focus the grate table can rotate a well a the telescope so that the angle between the grate and telescope can be measure the angle be measure by a vernier scale on the grate table 4 the spectrometer can be use to find the wavelength of the different colour of light observe by the relation of wavelength λ and angle of diffraction θ in the grate equation 4 1 the path difference d sin θ of the light can be calculate from fig 2 show the slit separation d in the diffraction grate and how the angle be define constructive interference between neighbour light ray occurs at point where whole wavelength meet so at a phase difference of 2πm where m be an integer multiple also refer to a the order the phase difference path difference × 2π λ 5 so combine this with the definition of the path difference we get 1 the wavelength calculate in 1 can be use in the rydberg formula 6 to calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ in equation 2 4 the spectrometer be set up a show in fig 1 with the `` source `` be a hydrogen lamp the slit be adjustable in width and the diffraction grate have the space 78.8 line per mm importantly there be also a crosshair on the telescope allow the observe line to be measure accurately to begin we align and focus the spectrometer by complete the follow step we make sure the telescope align with the collimator sharpen the image of the slit and make the crosshair align with it from this alignment we rotate the telescope exactly 90 • with the use of the highly precise vernier scale which use arc minute to measure the angle between the diffraction grate and telescope the high accuracy of the scale meant the uncertainty on any rotation be ±5 arc minute which approximates to ±0.08 • the rotation meant an accurate measurement of 45 • between the grate and incident beam could be found by align the grate so that the slit image fell on the crosshair finally the grate be rotate back 45 • to make sure the grate be set to 0 • incidence angle with the spectrometer calibrate we then measure the angle of diffraction from the central spectral line for the four observe colour in the hydrogen emission spectrum the central line have order m 0 so we take reading with increase order to one side of the line and decrease order to the other we take reading of the angle a a function of m for nine order four on each side and repeat the next set of result with a different observer my lab partner in order to reduce the subjective random error throughout the experiment we make sure to switch off the hydrogen lamp between reading in order to reduce the risk of it overheat despite this for the first lab session our lamp seem very hot we think that this along with our lamp be less intense in the colour magenta result in u not be able to see the blue and violet emission line for this first set of result due to the weaker lamp light it be also harder to see the crosshair and thus accurately align the emission lines-increasing the uncertainty for the second set of data reading the lamp be more intense in colour which meant we could take reading for three colour rather than two with the crosshair also be more visible plot the order m against the sine of the angle in radian give the graph in fig 3. the measure angle have to first be process by take the m 0 angle a zero thus subtract this value from the other angle and then convert the angle to radian a see in fig 3 we be unable to get reading fig 3. graph show the plot of order m against the sin of the angle for the three different colour wavelength red turquoise violet in the graph the red emission line produce the steepest gradient follow by the violet and then turquoise for the blue colour line in hydrogen 's emission spectrum n 5 the line of this colour be too faint to be observe even if we increase the slit width to allow more light through the error bar on the graph be very small not encompass the line of best fit for the respective wavelength our error be found by standard error propagation of sin θ. hence we be not quite sure why they be so small however we think it could be due to the high precision of the equipment a predict by theory in 1 we obtain straight line for each wavelength in the graph and they all cross around the point 0 0 the value of the gradient equal their respective wavelength multiply by the slit separation where the slit separation be 1mm/78.8 line and the uncertainty on the wavelength be calculate from the uncertainty in the gradient table show that the red and turquoise wavelength be both in the same order of magnitude a their accepted wavelength however the range of their uncertainty do n't include these value this again show how the calculate uncertainty be small than they should have be with such precise equipment we estimate our error in subjectivity by find the error in our observe line width the large value of the error on the line width and the half range of our data reading be take for error propagation our value for the wavelength of the violet light be highly inaccurate this be show by the violet wavelength be calculate a longer than the turquoise wavelength and in fig 3 it have a steeper gradient than turquoise the order of gradient steepness should have be red turquoise violet this inaccuracy of the violet wavelength make it hard to calculate the rydberg constant from rearrange 2 to plot 1 λ against 1 n 2 a a result of the inaccuracy there be no clear straight line relationship in fig 4 thus the gradient of the negative rydberg constant be not able to be calculate accurately if only the data for the turquoise and red spectrum line be use the rydberg constant be calculate a 1 × 10 7 m −1 show how these colour be more accurate a this agree with the accepted value to one significant figure naturally use two point for a line of best fit be not very reliable hence it be unfortunate that we be unable to get reading for the dark blue line to increase the accuracy of the line in fig 4. there be also not the possibility to work out the error on the line of best fit a the covariant matrix need more data point to find the rydberg constant we therefore found the r ∞ for each wavelength individually and then take the average we decide to include the value for the constant calculate with the violet data a we be not sure of the main error on it the error on the constant be calculate by standard error propagation our experimentally determine rydberg constant be calculate a with the same order of magnitude a the accepted value in 4 despite the error in our violet wavelength again the error here be very small thus not include the accepted value within the error limit we believe that the error in our violet line reading be not due to external condition such a temperature air pressure or humidity a this would have be the case for all line colour they could however have contribute a a systematic error to all wavelength since they be longer than theory we think the violet line reading could have be inaccurate due to the line become defocussed or the colour of the line not be clear enough to distinguish properly for this colour when conduct the experiment it be at time not clear if the line be the strongly define line suppose to be measure rather than a faint blue line or background colour our inaccurate measurement could also have be cause by the hydrogen lamp a it have a weaker pigment colour emit in comparison to other lamp the defocus could have occur when the the slit width be adjust to allow more light in this experiment aim to determine the rydberg constant by examine the emission spectrum of hydrogen it be conduct by the use of a spectrometer where the light from the hydrogen lamp travel through a diffraction grate the data for the angle of diffraction against order for the three observe colour be process to find the rydberg constant via the grate equation and rydberg formula our result be within the same magnitude of order a the accepted value for the constant we have a very small error on our data which meant it range do not include the accepted constant value our value for the violet wavelength be inaccurate and we be unable to take reading for the dark blue emission line a they be too faint we learnt how to use the vernier scale for the high accurate measurement of angle and how to set up the spectrometer to improve the experiment i would conduct it in a completely dark room without other people present so that their desk lamp would not affect my reading and to improve my chance of see the dark blue emission line i would also repeat the experiment more time to improve my statistical\"\n"," \"spectrometry be the science of study the emission and absorption spectrum of object the application of spectrometry range from determine the composition of a star to medical image the reason spectrometry can be use to determine the composition of a star be that each element emits a characteristic spectrum that can be extract from a more complicate spectrum such a that of a blackbody hydrogen when excite emits a line spectrum of discrete wavelength one series of these line be the balmer series which contains all transition to the n 2 energy level from high energy level much of this series be in the visible region of electromagnetic radiation so it can be observe by eye with a spectrometer by find the angular position of the maximum of the spectrum and make use of the grate equation it be possible to calculate accurate value for the wavelength of photon emit when electron fall to the n 2 state with these wavelength a graph can be plot make use of the rydberg equation from which a value for the rydberg constant can be found the rydberg constant be interest in that it can be describe a a combination of other more fundamental constant a good method for properly observe the spectrum of hydrogen be to have it ionise in a gas discharge lamp and then reading the line spectrum emit by the lamp splitting the line which make up the spectrum by use a diffraction grate spectrometer be highly accurate device and a such this method for investigate the rydberg constant can produce very accurate result a long a error be properly account for in the rutherford-bohr model of the atom 1 electron orbit the nucleus in discrete trajectory or energy level if a bound electron be provide with a specific amount of energy it will be excite to a high energy level the electron will then fall to a low energy level and a photon of discrete energy equal to the difference in the two energy level will be emit from the atom 1 while this model do n't well explain feature like the relative intensity of spectral line it do well explain the discrete wavelength of emit photon so it 's sufficient for this investigation grate spectrometer this effect can be observe in a gas by excite the electron of the gas and then use a diffraction grate to split the emit radiation into it constituent wavelength once the radiation have be diffract the angular position θ of the m th maximum where diffract ray interfere constructively for the wavelength λ be determine by 𝑚𝜆 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 1 for a diffraction grate with a line space of d metre transition wavelength for hydrogen can also be calculate use the rydberg equation where r∞ be the rydberg constant with a value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 1 n be the initial energy state of the excite electron and p be it final energy state here the medium that the radiation propagates through be approximate to a vacuum and the mass of the hydrogen nucleus be approximate to infinity in comparison to that of an electron a indicate by the symbol for the rydberg constant 2 the balmer series of transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by 2 with p 2 n 2 and n ϵ z. the first 6 of these wavelength be formally within the visible spectrum 3 method before measurement could be take the spectrometer be calibrate this involve first focus the eyepiece lens on the crosshair and then focus the crosshair onto a distant object while this should have be an object 'at infinity since the object be observe be on the atomic scale focus on a ruler 10 m away be sufficient the telescope camera and eyepiece lens be then align with the collimator without a diffraction grate in place and the collimator be focus onto a sodium gas-discharge lamp these lamp function by use an electric field to accelerate excite gas cation into noble gas atom which result in the cation gain an electron that then fall to a low energy level emit a photon of discrete energy it be this phenomenon that creates the balmer series which be be analyse there be another phenomenon that contributes to the emission spectrum of the gas which be incandescence this phenomenon have a great effect at high temperature and since the lamp operates at a high current this heating effect will be more significant the longer the lamp be operate for this reason the hydrogen lamp be not use to calibrate the spectrometer use the vernier scale on the spectrometer which have a resolution of 1 4 and be divide into third of a degree the telescope be rotate though 90º a grate of 78.8 line per mm 5 be then place in the holder vertically to ensure that the emission line would all be on the line swept out by the rotate telescope the grate be rotate through 45° and the height of the grate table be alter so that the sodium lamp 's central maximum be precisely at the crosshair with this do the grate be rotate back through 45° and the telescope be align back in line with the collimator the sodium lamp be then replace with the hydrogen lamp and measurement be take the angular position of the zero th order maximum be record a 135.43º all the follow maximum be measure relative to this zero point to find the angular position θ of the spectral line the grate be first observe directly to find the rough position of the line to where move use the fine adjustment knob to exactly align the emission line with the crosshair the angle be measure use the vernier scale with two independent measurement from two different observer this reduces the uncertainty in the angular position a the mean of the two point be take also the scale be read from above to avoid parallax error in the angle when the balmer series be observe emission line of colour red aqua and blue could be see for each colour the position of multiple maximum be record include negative maximum on the other side of the zero point this meant in total 6 maximum be record for the red aqua and blue wavelength every 6 measurement the lamp be turn off to cool and reduce it incandescence this ensure that the spectral line remain sharp with these measurement take mean value of each wavelength be calculate use the grate equation 1 and use 2 they be plot on a graph to determine a value for 𝑅 ∞ to verify that the data agrees with 1 the sine of the mean angular position of each maximum be plot against the maximum 's order the resolution of the vernier scale be 𝜋 10800 rad and measurement be take over 6 maximum where each measurement be repeat twice independently this result in the uncertainty σθ ± 2.42 × 10 −5 rad from this the uncertainty in each wavelength can be found a the uncertainty in the grate space can be assume to be negligible these wavelength be then use to plot figure 4 analysis of figure 4 provide a value of 1.099 ± 0.044 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 for the rydberg constant the accepted value of 1.097× 10 7 m -1 5 lie within this range which mean that the data be consistent with both the grate equation 1 and the rydberg equation 2 one potential source of error be the humidity of the air a discus 2 be dependent on the assumption that the medium between the source and the observer can be approximate to a vacuum however when the experiment be conduct the room be especially humid and warm which could well have interfere with the spectrum emit from the hydrogen lamp affect the result of the experiment additionally the balmer series of hydrogen include more discrete wavelength than the three measure in this investigation these other wavelength be in the upper band of the visible region verge on ultraviolet radiation which mean they will have be difficult to observe with the naked eye collect data for these line spectrum may well have lead to a more accurate value for 𝑅 ∞ another way uncertainty could have be reduce be if more than the first 3 maximum have be observable for the wavelength see they be likely invisible because their low intensity meant that the background light of the lab or the incandescence effect drown them out the aim of this investigation be to calculate a value for the rydberg constant the method use involve find the angular position of the maximum of multiple colour of the line spectrum of hydrogen a view through a grate spectrometer use the rydberg equation 2 to calculate 𝑅 ∞ the calculate value be 1.099 × 10 7 ± 0.044 𝑚 −1 which agrees with the model described by 2 this experiment could provide even more accurate value for the rydberg constant in a dry cool environment where many more reading be take with different equipment it would be possible to study the spectrum outside of the visible range which would provide more data to be analyse\"\n"," \"where r be the rydberg constant and be approximately equal to 1.097x10 7 m -1 and n1 and n2 be integer value and be equivalent to the initial and final state the rydberg constant can also be express a r ømc 2h where ø be the fine structure constant a dimensionless quantity 6 m be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be plank 's constant another important piece of theory to consider be the balmer series the balmer series be a series of line from the hydrogen emission spectrum cause by electron fall from the nth energy level to the principle quantum number 2 7 for instance the transition from energy level 3 to energy level 2 will appear red on the em spectrum 4- 2 will appear cyan in colour and transition 5- 2 will appear blue 8 use the balmer series therefore allows u to optically record and measure the diffraction scatter a 4 of the transition of n appear in the visible spectrum figure 2 illustrates different type of emission and absorption series include the balmer series it be clear to see that those transition in the lyman series will need considerably more energy to be able to transition to the other n band all the line in the lyman series be in the ultraviolet band and thus be not suitable for our investigation 10 the other series adjacent to the balmer series be the paschen series these transition will have less energy than the balmer transition and thus all the paschen line lie in the infrared band 11 a you move through the series the rate at which the wavelength increase decrease until you reach the convergence limit of the series this be in effect the energy need to ionize the hydrogen atom the figure below illustrates the most important part of the set up two type of discharge lamp be use in this investigation be compose of hydrogen and sodium the sodium lamp be use for the calibration of the spectrometer whereas the hydrogen lamp be use for the actual record the sodium lamp initially emit lilac light and then turn to an orange colour the hydrogen lamp use in this experiment produce a lot of heat which would significantly affect the operation time thus the hydrogen lamp be only use for the record whereas the sodium lamp could operate for long period of time this become one of the key consideration a all measurement would have to be take before the lamp overheat this would require an efficient way of record result after the source we have the slit ideally the slit should be a narrow a possible to make the angle measurement a precise a possible another part of the fix spectrometer be the collimator a collimator essentially produce a beam of parallel ray which be useful for when you want the wave to converge on the same focal point the grate use in this investigation have 300 line per mm the logic behind use a diffraction grate with more slit be the fact that these extra slit would reinforce the diffraction pattern make them more visible especially at the high order 13 the set up of the spectrometer be a lengthy one however this get easy over time the set up begin with the focus of the eyepiece on the crosswire this be do from about 5 meter ideally this should be do from an infinite distance 14 in this case a lamp on the other desk be focus on one consideration be to keep both eye open whilst focus the camera now the telescope have to be align with the axis of the collimator this could be do by very slightly opening the slit with the sodium lamp fully lit behind it now once the collimator be perfectly align with the telescope use the slow-motion drive on the side of the spectrometer stage the collimator be focus until a sharp image appear the cross wire be rotate by π 4 to ensue that the alignment of the stage could be a precise a possible carefully record the angle at which the main stage be rotate and the angle present on the two main scale be an essential part of the experiment a precision be require the main stage be initially move to an angle of 59.5 degree and 2 arc minute two arc minute be the equivalent of .03 of a degree it become essential to be able to quickly convert these reading of arc minute into the more useful degree now the telescope have to be move through exactly 90 degree it be very helpful to get a second opinion on the angle measurement and reach a consensus then the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit on the grate come from the collimator be see this should be at 45 degree to the normal of the spectrometer additionally the use of a mirror to double check the reflection from the collimator prove very useful the reading on the scale must be take down in the case of our set up the reading come out a 68 degree and 20 arc minute now the grate stage must be firmly fix to the main fine motor and this whole set up be move through 45 degree so that the grate be at the normal incidence when the grate stage be in place the grate stage can be move by turn 3 different screw which adjust the height of the main stage to ensure that when move through the angle of 6 figure 2 9 figure 3 12 observation all spectral line can be observe this can be checked by simply observe the spectral line through large angle of incidence and adjust appropriately in a more practical sense the stage be control by 3 screw a it be the most stable configuration a mathematically 3 point determine a plane so any more or less than this would be much less stable 15 when the camera and eye piece be move to the zero order the angular scale read 203 degree and 10 arc minute now the sodium lamp could be replace by the hydrogen lamp and data be record a range of 4 th to -4 th order be measure a a large spread of data would give the best possible set of data in addition to this a second opinion be always utilized a this would give a value of uncertainty value for 3 discrete wavelength emission be record and with these a graph of sinθ against order be plot from the gradient of this straight line plot a value for λ can be obtain the error bar on these graph come from the difference in the two measurement take of the same emission line an error of the gradient can also be show on python with this information and the understand of which wavelength be cause by which transmission the value obtain can be substitute into equation 5 with n1=2 to find the rydberg constant error bar be very small with only reading from the -2 nd 1 st and 2 nd order have an associate error this mean that both measurement from two different people be the same for most record result with this transition the uncertainty of the slope be slightly high than expect due to a minor spread in result at the -1 st and 3 rd order the straight line be expect to pa through the origin and the fact that the error do not cover the actual intercept record must mean an unknown source of error the uncertainty in the slope be considerably small than transition 3 to 2 and simply from observation all the point lie very close to the line once again the line almost pas through the origin and lie outside of the calculate error error bar on this graph be large for order -3 -1 and 2. uncertainty for the slope be even high than for the transition from 3 to 2. the most obvious thing about this plot be the fact that only +/-2 order be measure this be because the intensity of these order be too low to be measure use the human eye also notice that the error bar increase in size a the order increase this could be due to the change in intensity make any kind of measurement subjective if more than one person be use to record the angle once again the line of best fit almost pas through the origin this could be down to systematic error for which there be plenty in this experiment with this information the rydberg constant can be calculate for all 3 transition v. analysis and error from the data 2 of the 3 calculate value give a value for the rydberg constant that lay within the associate error those be the one obtain from the red and blue transition the value associate with the cyan transition have such a small calculate error that it do not pa through the actual value for the rydberg constant a the line be so uniform and without blemish the error must be systematic now if a mean of all 3 value be take you find it give a value of 1.11x10 7 if the actual value of the rydberg constant be give to be 1.097x10 7 then the associate percentage error be 1.19 the standard deviation between all 3 value be 1.34x10 5 which give a standard error of +/-77365 this once again lie outside of the range of the actual value if transition 4 to 2 be take away and just the other two be consider we get a mean of 1.097x10 7 of course more than two piece of information be need to be able to establish a constant of some sort however this be still encourage it be clear to see that systematic error come into play when the cyan spectrum band be measure one possibility be that since background light be all around during the procedure it be entirely possible that background spectral line be measure and record instead of the one from the hydrogen emission spectrum lightbulb produce a continuous spectrum a continuous spectrum be one which all wavelength be present and there be no gap 16 alternatively the error could 've come from a misalignment of the spectrometer for all three of these discrete transition wavelength the set up be realign and return to the central maximum at the normal to the grate it be entirely possible that during the reset of the spectrometer the diffraction grate may have move within the slide or the grate stage may have move to some degree the fact that this transition be measure last may suggest why this be the only graph affected by such systematic error general source of error be hugely dependent on the quality of the set up for instance the dimension of the slit when measure the emission line work two way one way be to keep the slit a narrow a possible and get result with optimum precision but fail to measure the high order which lack intensity or keep the slit slightly wider which would reduce the precision however a well spread of result would be obtain in the case of this set up the slit be left a little bit wider so that for at least two of the line 4 order could be measure it be impossible to say what uncertainty this compromise have however it be most likely very small and can be ignore another possible source could be from the measurement of angle whilst calibrate the instrument each time an angle be measure it have an uncertainty of +/-0.0083 degree now throughout the set up the angle be measure 3 time not include the actual measurement if add in quadrature this lead to an error of +/-0.014 degree this may sound small but it be the equivalent of almost a whole arc minute in addition the measurement of an angle have 2 angle uncertainty so in total that give an angle uncertainty of +/-0.019 degree this be a very small uncertainty equivalent to just over 1 arc minute this assumes that every measurement be take to the near arc minute whereas on occasion a second opinion can give a completely different measurement over all of the measurement take it be found that the average uncertainty a a result of disagreement be 0.28 of an arc minute this be a surprisingly low uncertainty for angle measurement if we take this alone other uncertainty be difficult to calculate a they be either assumption or they be too difficult to compute without specialist equipment in conclusion despite the fact that the value obtain lie outside of the predict uncertainty this set up and experiment should be deem a a successful one due to the fact that a good value be obtain and a very slight unaccountable systematic error be so frequent for this kind of set up the error calculate must be below the true error of the experiment the fact that a percentage error of only 1.19 be obtain show the success and the validity of the experiment even though a slightly low percentage difference be expect due to the sophistication of the instrument it can still be say that the rydberg constant be calculate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and this be especially the case for transition 3 to 2 and 5 to 2 a the rydberg constant lie within their error range a. transition\"\n","

light beam through glass slit and observe rainbow a spectrometer be an instrument use in spectrometric analysis which be make up of specialise piece of equipment the setup of the spectrometer be show in fig 1. in the case of light source the spectrum have three form hot object such a filament emits continuous spectrum where the intensity be a slowly vary function of wavelength an emission spectrum occurs when atom or molecule be excite in hot gas emit extra light with certain wavelength cause well-defined bright line to appear in the spectrum an absorption spectrum appear a dark line in continuous spectrum and be cause by continuous spectrum go through cool gas and the atom or molecule absorb certain value of wavelength the latter two kind of spectrum can give information of temperature or density of the gas 1 in this experiment the balmer series which be the visible part in hydrogen emission spectrum be observe 2 spectroscopy be one of the most power tool for the study of plasma star structure of chemical for example in astronomy we can use the unique spectrum to identify the chemical makeup of object in space or measure the temperature and velocity of space object the rydberg constant be introduce in bohr 's model which explains the atomic spectrum of hydrogen a well a various other atom and ion 3 it be not perfectly accurate but historically played an important role in the development of quantum mechanic and it be a good approximation for hydrogen atom the diffraction grate u the principle of interference to separate spectrum into different color the grate can be consider a a large number of n narrow slit of equal space with separation d. for light of wavelength λ a principal maximum occurs when the neighbor ray have constructive interference which mean the phase difference between them be an integer multiple m of 2π the path difference be dsin θ a see in fig 2 therefore which show where m be the order number on the interference pattern and θ be the angel between specific order and zero order by plot a graph of m against sin θ for a know d a graph of straight line passing through the origin would be produce and we can therefore obtain the value of wavelength from the gradient the resolve power r of a grate be a measure of it ability to separate adjacent spectral line of average wavelength λ 4 it be usually express a the dimensionless quantity a show in fig 3 with n slit the first minimum occurs at a phase angle which be the phase difference add the angel base on number of slit the resolve power can be found use the criterion that the maximum of one diffraction pattern be at the same position a the minimum of another pattern a show in fig 4 fig 4. diffraction pattern of λ1 λ2 and the resolution.the λ here be the minimum distance which can be distinguish by eye and would act a a source of uncertainty 2 the relationship between two wavelength be λ 2 λ − λ which accord to equation 2 give a phase difference 2π λ2 × d sin θ. this will give a minimum value if combine equation 3 and 7 we find base on definition λ 2 λ− λ where λ λ the equation can be rearrange where the left hand side of the equation give the resolve power of spectrometer at this separation the two line can be easily see to be separate since the intensity at a point half way between two equal line be 20 less than the peak 2 to find the value of the rydberg constant the formula of transition wavelength in hydrogen be use where n and n be integer which represent the high energy level and low energy level respectively 3 .in balmer series in hydrogen n'=2 and n=3,4,5 correspond to red blue and violet line of the visible spectrum.fig 5 show the transition of electron in a hydrogen atom λ be the transition wavelength which can be obtain from equation 3 .r ∞ be the rydberg constant which have an accepted value of 10973731.56851m −1 6 fig 5. representation of the transition in a hydrofen atom where balmer trainsitions be at n'=2 7 a more fundamental form explain in the bohr model can be express a where m e be the mass of the electron c be the speed of light h be the plank 's constant and 0 be electrical field permittivity of free space the spectrometer be set up a below procedure to make sure the instrument be properly align and focused.we firstly focus the eyepiece on the cross-hair `` x `` with both eye open and then focus the camera lens so that an object which be approximately 10 meter away be focus on the cross line the telescope eyepiece and camera lens be make align with the collimator and than the focus of the collimator be adjust with the sodium lamp illuminate until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire we then do the follow to make sure the light be at normal incidence so the measure angle be not affected by misalignment.the telescope be rotate precisely 90 degree with the aid of the scale a mirror be put on on the holder and grate table be turn until we just saw a reflect image at the cross-line in the eyepiece which mean the grate be at 45 degree to the incident beam.the grate be then rotate 45 degree precisely use the scale and light be at normal incidence the spectrometer can obtain precise measurement if set up properly with a precision about ± 0.2nm for yellow orange light 2 also the reading would be a precise a 1 60 degree for the measurement of spectrometer resolution the 7 th order of the sodium source be observe we reduce the effective number of grate line by gradually slide two piece of parallel card which be put in front of the grate until we could just resolve the two line of the yellow doublet.the width of space between two card be measure use vernier caliper which have an uncertainty ±0.1mm from the center and multiple measurement be take to calculate the mean and standard deviation the measurement be take by two person individually and the average be calculate to minimize random error while take readings.six set of measurement be take in total for red blue and violet line in the hydrogen spectrum and measurement for each color be repeat once.the result be then analyze in python accord to equation 3 where the gradient of the graph be equal to d λ the associate graph be show in fig 6. fig 6. graph of order against sin θ for different color.linear relation between the order and sin θ be show which be correct accord to equation 3 the gradient of each graph be then calculate use python.the result of the wavelength and it uncertainty be show in table .1. the accepted value for balmer series for n= 3,4,5 which corresponds to red blue and violet in this experiment and their wavelength be 656.3nm,486.1nm and 434.0nm respectively 8 .this give the experimental value for wavelength of uncertainty 1.31 1.54 1.25 1.87 1.06 and 14.6 which be quite accurate except the second measurement of violet line nevertheless a show in fig 6 the graph for the second measurement of violet fail to match a straight line this indicates systematic error in the measurement take therefore this set of data would not be use to obtain the rydberg constant the uncertainty of 1 λ be give by where k be the gradient of the graph and d be the grate space which be equal to 3.3840947546531303×10 −6 m for 300 line per mm grate and 1.269035532994924×10 −5 m for 80 line per mm grate and the uncertainty of the experimental value of rydberg constant be simply give by which be why the uncertainty of 1 λ be calculate instead of λ previously then the value of the rydberg constant calculate from each measurement with it uncertainty be show in table .2 where equation 10 be use the mean value of the rydberg constant be calculate and the error be add in quadrature give a final value r ∞ 10819294.13 ± 82184.5m −1 for the spectrometer resolution seven set of measurement be take and provide a mean value for card width 2.34±0.02 mm the number of sufficient slit n be then calculate by where 80 lines/mm grate be use and give n=187.2±1.6 accord to equation 9 the resolution of λ 0.4489 ± 0.05 nm the data be interpret in way such that the random error can be minimize firstly the zero order of each wavelength in the spectrum be obtain by calculate the mean of m ±1 to reduce the uncertainty at this order.the importance of this approach be that the diffract line should be symmetrical about the normal and the angel should be same for ±n th order.secondly the second measurement of violet line be not use because the graph suggest the data obtain be wrong.this could due to the intensity of violet light be dimmer than other color which make it more difficult to measure precisely.nevertheless there be four visible hydrogen emission spectrum in balmer series 9 so the forth color might interrupt the reading and hence the result might be record in the wrong order number there be several possibility for systematic error in this experiment for example the light noise from lamp and computer and eye parallax while take the reading.also misalignment and defocus of the instrument might contribute to the error when set up the apparatus or when they be accidentally move during the experiment.furthermore factor such a grate period air pressure or humidity can also have an effect on the measurement in conclusion the rydberg constant and the resolve power of a spectrometer have be deduce by observe hydrogen and sodium spectrum ussing the spectrometer.the first method use be to record the angle of different order for three different wavelength and deduce the rydberg constant from gradient of the graph plot from data.the second method be to measure the efficient grate number for the doublet to just resolve and hence find the resolution the obtain value of the rydberg constant give 1.4 uncertainty compare to the accepted value 10973731.56851m −1 which be quite satisfactory.the result of resolution of the spectrometer show the precision of a spectrometer and this provide sufficient confidence for the result obtain use this instrument the experiment have be do and data have be analyze to minimize error with sufficient approach such a repeat measurement find zero order by average angel at ±1 order and abandon wrong data.also the associate error be calculate in a delicate way.however the experiment can be improve by building up a large data base and observe four color instead of three which be feasible if apparatus be align and focus perfectly.also reduce the background light and fix the lamp position can also improve the experiment\"\n"," \"in this report we detail how a spectrometer be use to determine the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ to a relatively high degree of precision use the spectral emission line from excite hydrogen gas we first calibrate the spectrometer to make accurate repeatable measurement before use it to measure the angle at which the maximum of diffract light from the emission spectrum of excite hydrogen occur maximum angle be then record for the observe red cyan and blue spectral line of the balmer series which yield wavelength of 656.12 ± 0.33 nm 485.90 ± 0.41 nm and 433.78 ± 0.38 nm respectively use elementary diffraction grate theory and the rydberg formula base on the bohr model of the atom we then calculate a value for the rydberg constant for each wavelength before use these value to arrive at a final value for 𝑅 ∞ of 1.0975 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 we then finally move on to examine the extent of random error in our result and discus potential cause of systematic error which may have contribute to our obtain value deviation from the accepted value for 𝑅 ∞ of 10973731.6 m -1 1 from a young age we be familiarise with the notion of atom be comprise of negatively charge electron orbit a heavy positively charge nucleus after much development in atomic theory over the last century we now know that atom have a much richer structure involve the idea that electron have quantise energy state and be described probabilistically by their wavefunction one of the key development in atomic theory come in 1913 when the idea that light be emit a discrete quantum of energy a propose by einstein and planck be use by neils bohr to formulate the semi-quantum bohr model of the atom which provide a justification to the then empirically derive rydberg formula the formula itself provide a relation between energy level transition make by electron and the wavelength of photon they emit a we will soon see this equation involves a constant know a the rydberg constant which be what we aim to measure use a diffraction grate spectrometer although more modern and sophisticated photo spectrometric method exist 2 to measure wavelength to an even great degree of accuracy 3 the method present here still provide a relatively accurate value for the rydberg constant despite it make use of a relatively simple experimental setup the spectrometer be in principle a simple piece of apparatus which first collimates a source of light into a single beam which be then normal and incident on a diffraction grate comprise of slit of separation d. from elementary diffraction theory we can recall that whenever the phase difference φ between two ray coincident at a point be an integer multiple m of 2𝜋 the ray will constructively interfere to produce a maximum from figure 1 we can easily see by geometry that the path difference between adjacent ray be equal to 𝑑 sin 𝜃 where 𝜃 be the angle between the ray incident to the m th order maximum and the grate normal since path difference be equal to 𝜆𝜑/2𝜋 we can equate to yield 𝑑 sin 𝜃 𝑚 𝜆 1 from this we can see that a plot of sin 𝜃 against order number will produce a graph whose linear fit will have a gradient 𝜆/𝑑 thus since d be know we can calculate the wavelength of the light pas into the spectrometer which in our case be from the de-excitation of hydrogen atom when the electron de-excite they do so by 'falling from an energy level n down to a level of low energy p and in do so they emit a photon of energy equal to the energy difference traverse by the electron to explain the relation between n p and the wavelength of emit light bohr postulate that the angular momentum l of electron be quantise with relation to planck 's constant 4 such that where ħ be the reduce planck constant bohr then also assume that the electron follow classical circular orbit thus allow for the relation of l to the electron velocity v via 𝐿 𝑚 𝑒 𝑣𝑟 where r be the orbital radius and 𝑚 𝑒 the mass of the electron from this we find that if we now attribute the centripetal force f maintain the orbit to the electrostatic coulomb attraction between the electron and the nucleus which both posse a charge of e for hydrogen we can write where 𝜀 0 be the permittivity of free space this can be rearrange and combine with equation 3 to show that the electron exist at discrete radius 𝑟 𝑛 from the nucleus such that by invoke the non-relativistic equation for kinetic energy and again invoke equation 3 it can be show that the energy 𝐸 𝑛 of an electron in the nth energy level be give by where 𝐸 1 be the ground state the low energy state an electron may occupy now since an emit photon 's energy be equal to the energy decrease an electron experience during de-excitation note energy level have negative value we can write where 𝐸 𝑝 be the magnitude of the energy level the electron de-excites to and 𝜆 be the wavelength of the emit photon if we combine this with equation 6 we arrive the once empirically obtain rydberg equation where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant which may be express a this be the quantity which we will set out to measure by use the spectrometer to determine the wavelength of emit photon if we then finally combine equation 8 with equation 1 we can relate 𝑅 ∞ to the angle 𝜃 of maximum order m to give where g be the gradient of the linear fit for a graph of sin 𝜃 against m thus if n and p be know we can measure 𝑅 ∞ fig 2. an energy diagram show some of the energy level an electron may occupy within a hydrogen atom the arrow show correspond to transition an electron may make during deexcitation the arrow be show in group correspond to the energy level they transit to which be know a the series of the transition show here left to right be the paschen balmer and lyman series 5 dash arrow indicate the infinite amount of possible transition due to electron transition from the infinite number of high energy level whose limit be the ionisation energy of hydrogen figure 2 show some of the theoretically infinite possible transition an electron may make during de-excitation in our experiment we will be observe only the balmer series which be the collection of transition where the electron de-excites to the second energy level correspond to p 2 a we be restrict to only be able to measure visible wavelength in our experiment we will measure the first three wavelength correspond to n 3 4 and 6 also refer to a ba-α ba-β and ba-γ transition the first part of the experiment consist largely of set up the spectrometer correctly to enable it to make accurate and repeatable measurement to begin the eye piece be focus onto the crosshair which be position such that the line be diagonal and would not be parallel to spectral line the camera lens be then focus to an object at an arbitrarily long distance ≈ 10m to ensure that the source can be accurately resolve the room be darken to minimise background light before a test sodium lamp be then turn on and place in front of the slit a mirror be secure into the same central position a where the grate will reside the telescope be then align with the collimator and the slit be set at a small width to aid in determine peak focus before it be place in front of the collimator the collimator focus be the adjust until maximum focus of the slit be achieve the crosshair be then align to the centre of the slit and the correspond angular position be record a 169°00 the telescope be then rotate through 90° result in a position of 79°00 ± 1 the telescope be temporarily secure and grate table hold the mirror be rotate until the sodium emergent from the narrow slit be incident on the crosshair see through the telescope at this point the rotational position of the table be record again a 79°00 ± 1 to ensure it have not move before it be then rotate by 45° such that the grate table and by extension the mirror be normal to the ray incident to the mirror after be unsecured the telescope be then move back round to it approximate initial position the mirror be then replace by a 300 div/mm diffraction grate orient such that the grate be approximately vertical we then view the spectral pattern of the diffract sodium light through the telescope the fine adjustment screw on the central grate table be then alter until all the visible spectral line on both side of the central maximum be a vertical a possible with respect to the crosshair and by extension the plane of rotation to minimise the skew of the pattern to enable a many maximum to be see a possible with this the setup process conclude and we then move on to make measurement the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen lamp before we proceed to record the angular position of the maximum for the observe red cyan and blue spectral line use the vernier scale on the spectrometer for each colour the first and second order maximum position be record a total of three time result in a total of 45 measurement be make include the measurement of the position of the central maximum the 3 rd order maximum be very faint compare to the other maximum and their position be hard to determine thus they be not measure a they would introduce a significant amount of random error through the spectrometer telescope we be able to resolve red cyan and blue spectral line which by reference to figure 2 we can attribute to the n 3 n 4 and n 5 initial energy level in the balmer series respectively a expect note that the wavelength we have call blue may be interpret a violet or purple by some for all measurement a diffraction grate of slit separation 3.33 ± 0.03 µm be use all the angle for each set of measurement be normalise with respect to the position of the central maximum to mitigate the introduction of systematic error from the telescope be misalign in between set of measurement be make the main source of statistical uncertainty arises from the fact that it be difficult to determine the exact location of the maximum of a spectral line due to the subjective nature of the human eye the degree of this effect be positively correlate with the observe width which be obtain by measure the thickness of the maximum correspond to m 1 for each colour which for all wavelength be see to be roughly 25 although the width of the bright region in which one could realistically determine to be the maximum have a small width of around 10 the width of this be then halve to obtain the effective error of 5 this effect be exacerbate by the vernier scale be inherently difficult to read exactly by eye especially give the dim light result in a designate reading error of around ± 3 if we consider this along with the maximum width error the result uncertainty of the measurement of each maximum be around 6 which be then incorporate into the gradient error by plot figure 3 we obtain an error-weighted fit for each wavelength use python 's covariance matrix function from this the gradient be then use along with the split separation and equation 1 to calculate the wavelength of each of the observe colour a summarise below for each wavelength the correspond rydberg constant and it error be then calculate by application of equation 10 see appendix for detail the wavelength for red and cyan agree with their accepted value but blue do not derive rydberg constant m -1 1.0974 ± 0.0005 × 10 7 cyan 1.0980 ± 0.0009 × 10 7 1.0979 ± 0.0006 × 10 7 table ii a summary show the rydberg constant and their uncertainty derive from the wavelength show in table i. the error associate with each wavelength be calculate base on the error of the gradient of it correspond linear fit and the error in slit separation we can see from table i that all of our measure value and their uncertainty agree with the accepted value from the value in table ii we obtain a mean value for the rydberg constant of 𝑅 ∞ 1.0977 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 a deviation of 0.048 from the accepted value of 10973731.6 m -1 there be many possible factor which may have contribute to the overall systematic uncertainty in our measurement the most likely and obvious of which be the improper setup of the spectrometer in particular the misalignment of the diffraction grate cause it to be nonnormal to the ray incident on it another possible source of systematic error can be attribute to the variation in wavelength result from the refractive index of air not be exactly equal to that of air in a vacuum to investigate this idea we can consider the wave equation and recall the definition of a refractive index n of a material a the ratio of c to the wave speed in the medium from this we can then relate a wavelength 𝜆 of light in a medium to it wavelength in a vacuum 𝜆 0 a 𝜆 0 𝑛𝜆 10 if we now take n to be the accepted value of the refractive index of air at standard temperature and pressure a 𝑛 1.000277 6 from these value we obtain the value show in table ii and a final value for the rydberg constant of 𝑅 ∞ 1.0975 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 which have a small deviation from the accepted value of just 0.012 the wavelength for blue be now also in agreement with the accepted value show in table ii note that the assumption that the air use be under standard condition be valid a it can be show apply elden 's formula 7 to possible deviation from standard condition yield negligible difference in refractive index the uncertainty associate with the value of n itself be consider negligible a it experimental uncertainty be of the order ± 10 -8 our experiment set out to measure the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy use only a spectrometer and the bohr model of the atom our final obtain value for 𝑅 ∞ of 1.0975 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 agrees with the accepted value with a percentage difference of just 0.012 although our method obtain a relatively accurate result there be several way in which it could be modify to far increase the accuracy for example the great source of random error arose from the difficulty in accurately reading the vernier scale which could easily be solve via the digitisation of the vernier scale this would carry the add advantage of make the measurement process less laborious meaning that more measurement could be make in our limited allocate time which would far reduce the statistical error the other major source of random error which arose due to the difficulty in determine the position of the central point of maximum could be resolve use a photodiode which would allow u to quantitatively determine the point at which peak intensity and by extension the maximum occur the use of a photodiode would also have the add benefit of lift our restriction on be able to measure only visible wavelength meaning that we would be able to obtain measurement from the other transition series of hydrogen depict in figure 2 thus allow for a large data set and a form of verification that bohr 's model do indeed hold for all energy transition a point worth note be that the red maximum be notably brighter and more prominent than the other colour which may be attribute to the fact that at low voltage the baα transition be more probable to occur 8 result in red have a great intensity to resolve this one could simply increase the voltage a the other two transition probability increase with voltage up to a limit another possible reason for red have a great intensity be that in the visible spectrum low wavelength light be emit at a great intensity by hot body such a the incandescent lamp use in the laboratory a described by planck 's radiation law 9 although this effect could be rule out by simply carry out the experiment in a strictly zero-background light environment although a consideration of light wavelength dependence on refractive index result in our calculate value agree with the accepted value to a marginally great extent the fact that all value for 𝑅 ∞ be great than the accepted value suggests some form of systematic error be likely from the general mis-alignment of the equipment which can only be remedied by take great care during the setup procedure or by use more sophisticated equipment the standard rule of error propagation be apply to equation 10 to give an expression for the uncertainty 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ in the rydberg constant a where 𝜎 𝑑 be the absolute uncertainty in slit separation 𝜎 𝐺 be the absolute uncertainty in the gradient and k be a constant define a 1/4 -1/n 2 -1\"\n"," \"in this experiment the diffraction pattern of a collimate beam of light from a hydrogen lamp incident on a grate be observe calculate two of the balmer transition wavelength and use these to calculate the rydberg constant from the diffraction pattern of the red transition wavelength the rydberg constant r ∞ be calculate to be 10920433.3 +/-9208.4 m -1 whereas use the turquoise transition wavelength r ∞ be calculate equally successfully to be 11011588.6 +/-14990.0 m -1 give error of 0.49 and 0.34 respectively in comparison to the true value of 10973731.6 m -1 when electromagnetic radiation be pas through a spectrometer the beam be collimate by a lens and then disperse by a grate this allows the diffraction pattern to be focus observe and use the vernier scale the position of the maximum can be measure for a beam of wavelength λ and separation d of slit in the grate the maximum of order m will be at the angle θ described by 1 𝜃 𝑠𝑖𝑛 −1 𝑚 𝜆 𝑑 from which the wavelength can be calculate use this and knowledge of the transition wavelength of the source of radiation in this case hydrogen in a hydrogen lamp the rydberg constant can then be calculate in this experiment we aim to observe the diffraction pattern of the different transition wavelength of the balmer series characteristic to the define energy shift within the hydrogen atom in excitation use knowledge of these shift we also aim to accurately measure the rydberg constant when an electric current be pas through a tube contain hydrogen gas it cause the excitation and subsequent deexcitation of the electron cause the emission of photon of characteristic wavelength to the distinct energy gap between energy level due to the energy of the electron be quantise four of these transition wavelength exist in the spectrum of visible light so can be observe by the human eye in a spectrometer the beam from the hydrogen lamp be collimate by a lens before fall incident on a diffraction grate at the grate multiple path be take by the beam to the point where the intensity be be observe each have slightly differ path length cause the path to be at different point in their phase progression cause the path to interfere the difference in path length be give by 2 difference in path length 𝑑 sin 𝜃 found from the assumption that the path to the point of measurement be virtually parallel and so can be view like in the follow figure carefully put in place and the position of the 0 th order maximum where θ 0° be found to be ≈ 66° use the vernier 's scale allow it to be identify in the result initially the diffraction pattern of the red light be examine the telescope be rotate to the great degree where the maximum be still discernible and the location of this maximum be record the position of the successive maximum be then record until the maximum become indiscernible cover the whole spectrum that would still give precise measurement the measurement be then repeat by a second observer to give data for comparison to check for erroneous result the same process be then repeat for the diffraction pattern result from the turquoise light the blue and the violet diffraction pattern be observe to check for similar trend however not measure due to have too few discernible maximum to give a trend that would provide accurate result the sine of the location of the maximum be then plot against the order in the relationship give by equation 4 which be thus plot use the gradient of which easily give the wavelength of the light use the balmer series the 2 calculate wavelength be equate with the correspond wavelength produce from change in energy level of the electron in hydrogen described by their transition from initial state n n 3 for the red light n 4 for turquoise to final state p p 2 in the balmer series allow the rydberg constant to be calculate use equation 5 for the 2 different diffraction pattern due to the calculation for the rydberg constant only require a string of multiplication the error analysis only require the use of two equation for their propagation 6 𝜎 𝑓 f√ equation 6 be apply in the case of calculate error in slit space d from error in the number of slit per unit distance s a d s -1 and error in the calculate rydberg constant from error in the wavelength 7 be apply in the case of calculate error in wavelength from the error in gradient m from the calculate covariance matrix and slit space d. for both diffraction pattern analyse the 2 set of data 1 from each observer be treat independently and compare to check for any erroneous result once compare and trend checked the 2 value for rydberg 's constant be calculate and a mean average be take due to error in θ be so small in comparison to the measure value the error bar have not be include in the graph for clarity the value for r ∞ determine experimentally be compare against the accepted value 12 r ∞ 10973731.6 m -1 and so can be see that the calculate value both come very close to the true value have error of 0.49 and 0.34 for the red and turquoise diffraction pattern respectively the result also come with very small uncertainty 0.08 and 0.14 respectively with the experiment have very high precision with very little random error however neither allows for the accepted value to fall within their range include uncertainty this suggests there be some small systematic error in the experiment or a random error exists from a source that have n't be identify these systematic error may possibly exist in manufacturing error in the slit error in focus or misalignment of the spectrometer or even in change condition in the laboratory additional random error that could account for the accepted value fall out of the range of uncertainty be in the maximum not be perfectly distinct a the initial slit be imperfect due to obstruction on it edge the edge of maximum be not a sharp a would be ideal for the experiment the orientation of maximum be also not perfectly vertical despite somewhat be counteract by align the crosshair with the midpoint of the maximum this may be another source of uncertainty additionally maximum at large angle be not perfectly focus add uncertainty and possibly identify a systematic error in focus and their intensity drop significantly both reduce the precision in measurement for the location of the maximum these error would have be partially cover in the error found in the gradient from the covariance matrix of the line of best fit however their magnitude may be underrepresented in the final uncertainty an indication of a source of possible source of systematic error could be see when observe the maximum upon examination there be maximum that could not be identify use the balmer series at regular interval hint at an error in set-up or with the grate or other equipment however if the average between the two calculate value for the rydberg constant be take it give 13 average calculate value for r ∞ 10966011.0 +/-8796.2 m -1 which have only 0.07 error and also include the accepted value for the rydberg constant within it range of uncertainty while maintain a very high precision overall this experiment be highly successful achieve the aim set out of calculate the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy with the final calculate value only have an error of 0.07 with the accepted value also fall within the range of uncertainty however the value calculate directly from each diffraction pattern be not quite a accurate and the accepted value lay outside both range of uncertainty suggest there be a small systematic error or an unaccounted/not fully account source of random error the most likely cause for this be a systematic error in the setup or manufacturing error of the equipment or slit see in the existence of unidentifiable maximum when the diffraction pattern be observe which may have alter the pattern and give rise to the small amount of error additionally there be some source of random error that have uncertainty that may have be underrepresented by the uncertainty in the gradient stem from the uncertainty in location of the maximum however for these random error to increase the uncertainty to the point where it include the accepted value it would require the final standard error in their result to increase by a factor of 5 and 2 respectively which be heavily unlikely due to the small magnitude of the uncertainty in location therefore be unlikely to be a significant factor in the inaccuracy of the calculate value ultimately both calculate result and the final average value have a very high level of accuracy and so any small factor or change in condition may have cause these error due to their magnitude a can be see in it high accuracy the experiment have many strength include the high precision measurement the experiment allow to be take and the ease of the experiment allow a large amount of data to be take however despite it large amount of success the experiment can still be improve upon in particular reduce the background light would allow for the width of the initial slit and the maximum to be reduce due to an increase in visibility of the maximum increase precision in the measurement this change would also allow for maximum of blue and violet colour to be more visible and so also accurately measure give more possible data to support or dispute the calculate value increase accuracy and confidence in the final result\"\n"," \"where 𝜆 be the wavelength r ∞ be the rydberg constant with a measure value of 10973731.6 m -1 n and p be integer represent the energy

equation can be use to determine the wavelength of light where dsinθ be the path difference a show in fig 6 and m be the order number rearrange this equation we get therefore if we plot sinθ vs. m the gradient of the line of best fit of the graph will be the value of since we know the value of d we can calculate the wavelength of the light after determine the wavelength we have all the data we need to calculate the experimental value of rydberg constant use equation 1 fig 6. the path difference between light that go through the grate in this experiment we use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta and the wavelength of the light emit by a hydrogen lamp then calculate the rydberg constant in order to set up the spectrometer we focus the eyepiece and camera and align them with the axis of the collimator we set the cross wire a an `` x `` since it be easy to use this way then we turn the telescope which be the eyepiece and the camera lens through 90 degree and adjust the grate table until a reflect image be see in the eyepiece this mean that the incident beam from the collimator be now at 45 degree to the grate surface a show in fig 7. then we rotate the grate through precisely 45 degree accord to the scale so that it be set at 0 degree to the incident light beam 2 in order to make sure that the spectrum be not inclined we cover the upper and low part of the light source use two piece of tape a show in fig 8 thus the light be shorten and be fit into the cross wire completely a show in fig 9. by do this when we rotate the eyepiece we be allow to check if the spectrum be inclined left spectrum observe without use tape to shorten them when rotate the telescope can not check if the spectrum be inclined right spectrum observe after use tape to shorten them can check if the emission spectrum be inclined when rotate the telescope we rotate the telescope left and right horizontally until we observe a light and note the value of theta at that position in order to get a value for the uncertainty in theta me and my lab partner both read the value and we estimate that there be an error of ± 1.45 × 10 -4 radian associate with our measurement since both of u read a value of theta for each order we have two value of theta associate with the light since the space between the central maximum and the emit light with the same colour of an order that have the same magnitude should be equal e.g the red emit light of order ± 1 have the same distance from the central maximum the angle theta of the positive and negative order should have the same magnitude therefore we plot the sine of the average value of theta against the magnitude of the order accord to equation 3 the gradient of the line of best fit corresponds to the value of therefore by multiply the gradient by d we determine the wavelength by use equation 1 we can obtain the value of rydberg constant iv error result discussion by use equation 1 and the theoretical value of the rydberg constant we predict that the long wavelength of the light that we could observe be 656 nm this light be create when electron drop from energy level three to energy level two use the standard colour spectrum chart we found that the light with the long wavelength that we could expect to see be the red light refer to equation 1 we need the value of wavelength to determine the rydberg constant accord to equation 3 the graph sinθ vs. m should be a straight line and the gradient of the line of best fit corresponds to the value of by plot the data from table i. we obtain graph 1.0 and graph 2.0. in this experiment the grate we use have 78.8 line per mm therefore the space d be 0.0127 mm the gradient of the line of best fit for the green light be 0.04208 rad/m multiply this value by 0.0127 × 10 -3 m we determine that the wavelength of green light be 535 ± 185 nm similarly we determine the wavelength of red light be 678 ± 185 nm since the wavelength be a function of and a constant d we calculate the error associate with the wavelength by do differentiation formula use be show in appendix rearrange equation 1 for the rydberg constant therefore the rydberg constant be a function of 𝜆 n and p. since n and p be the energy level there be no error associate with them and 2 can be treat a a constant therefore only 𝜆 contributes to the error associate with 𝑅 we determine the error associate with it by do differentiation with respect to 𝜆 formula use be show in appendix we calculate the error associate with the rydberg constant to be ± 28993.5 m -1 for the red emit light and ± 35283.0 m -1 for the green emit light theta θ rad order table i. the value of theta associate with the 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd order red light and green light since there be energy release when electron drop from a high energy state to a low one and energy can be calculate by use where e be the energy h be planck 's constant and f be the frequency also where c be the speed of light 𝜆 be the wavelength combine equation 5 and 6 we get therefore energy be inversely proportional to the wavelength the light with the long wavelength be emit when the least amount of energy be release thus for the red light it initial state be 3 final state be 2. therefore n be equal to 3 and p be equal to 2. by use equation 1 and the wavelength we determine we calculate that the rydberg constant be 10622602.54 ± 28993.5 m -1 for the green light it initial state be 4 final state be 2. therefore we calculate the rydberg constant to be 9978172.747 ± 35283.0 m -1 compare these value with the theoretical value of the rydberg constant 10973731.6 m -1 there be 3.1 difference between the two value for the red emit light and 9.0 between the two value for the green emit light calculation be show in appendix the rydberg constant calculate use the data for the red light be more accurate than the one calculate use data of the green light one of the reason be that during the experiment we notice that the red light be observe to be more focus than the green light therefore we be more likely to get accurate measurement of theta for the red light graph 1.0 sinθ vs. m for the green light graph 2.0 sinθ vs. m for the red light the error associate with the reading of theta be random error it be cause by our judgement to determine this error we read off the theta from the scale alternatively and estimate that the uncertainty associate with the theta we measure be ± 1.45×10 -4 radian there be other source of error that affected our data for example when we observe the light the light be a bit blurry so defocus exist this mean that when we read off the angle the value be not precise also there be background light give that we be not work in a complete dark environment this could have impact on our data because the background light affected our judgement to place the emit light on the same place for each measurement and make it hard for u to observe the light clearly therefore we could not get measurement of theta also since we align the spectrometer manually the equipment could be not in the completely align position a a result of misalignment the value of angle theta we measure could be not accurate v. conclusion by do this experiment we determine the rydberg constant r ∞ which have a measure value of 10973731.6 m -1 to 9978172.747 ± m -1 for the green emit light and 10622602.54 ± m -1 for the red emit light the method use in this experiment be to use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta associate with the emit light for an order m then calculate the wavelength 𝜆 associate with the light via equation 2 together with these data we use equation 1 to calculate the rydberg constant the percent difference between the theoretical value of rydberg constant and the experimental value we obtain be 9.0 for the green emit light and 3.1 for the red emit light calculation be show in appendix this experiment show that one way to determine the rydberg constant be to use a spectrometer during the experiment we measure the data we need without major problem and the final result be relatively close to the theoretical value of r ∞ however we spent a large amount of time do the set-up therefore we fail to complete all the calculation within the time give from this experiment we learnt a way to determine the rydberg constant also we reinforce our knowledge on identify source of error such a defocus misalignment we also have a deeper understand of the importance of preliminary data by take preliminary data we gain some knowledge about the process thus we can take the definitive data more efficiently and accurately appendix formula use in calculate percent difference\"\n"," 'with a grate spectrometer a diffraction grate and a hydrogen lamp hydrogen spectral line be

value lay outside the experimental uncertainty in calculate rydberg constant the conduct experiment be to accurately determine the rydberg constant with the use of a grate spectrometer specifically this meant passing the light of a hydrogen lamp through the slit in one end of the spectrometer and use the telescope at the other to determine different angle at which different maximum on a diffraction pattern occur this enable the use of equation to calculate the wavelength of the emission spectrum and then the rydberg constant from the bohr model atom have definitive energy level where electron exist 2 in a gas when an electron receives sufficient energy it becomes excite and jump to a high energy level during the experiment a voltage be put across a hydrogen lamp thus excite electron of hydrogen atom once electron have jumped to a high energy level they deexcite back down energy level release a photon or photon if they do this in multiple stage these photon frequency can be calculate use the equation where e be the energy of a photon in joule h be plank constant in joule second and f be the frequency in hertz the energy of these photon be equal to the difference in potential energy of the energy level the electron move between some of the frequency and thus the wavelength f the photon from hydrogen be in the visible spectrum between 390nm and 700nm 3 and this mean that they can be observe use the human eye in hydrogen these transition be from the balmer series and specifically be call 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 show red aqua and blue colour respectively if we then calculate the wavelength of these emission we can use the transition formula for hydrogen to calculate the rydberg constant where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant in 𝑚 −1 𝜆 be the wavelength of the photon

second 1 the rydberg constant be a constant use throughout physic and be particularly useful a it share a relationship with other fundamental physical constant where 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of an electron in kilogram c be the speed of light in meter per second and 𝛼 be the fine structure constant which be unitless b. spectrometer theory when incident light pas into a diffraction grate the light will split and superimpose produce an interference pattern this superposition will be constructive if two beam of light have a phase difference of an integer n of 2𝜋n at these point maximum will be observe and the angle from the incident beam can be measure use the telescope from figure 2 we can use trigonometry to get the equation for this first order maximum where d be the slit separation in meter and 𝜃 be the angle of diffraction in radian this equation be for a path difference be one wavelength and so the other maximum occur when the path difference be an integer n wavelength apart this give the equation where n be the order of the maximum to obtain the most accurate value for the wavelength of 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 the spectrometer be align such that the grate be perpendicular to the incident light this ensures the central maximum of each 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 will be on top of each other to get a standard zero value it also mean that the interference pattern be in accordance with 6 a 6 would not be valid for light enter non-perpendicular to the slit this ensures the most accurate result possible the first procedure carry out to align the spectrometer be focus the eyepiece such that the cross be clear this be to stop strain on the eye over long period of time it be also ensure that the crosshairs show a `` cross `` shape oppose to a `` plus `` a a cross be easy to distinguish on a dark background secondly the objective lens be focus this be conduct by move the spectrometer to a window the objective lens be then adjust until the building opposite come into focus now the collimator need to be focus with the telescope this be carry out in a dark room and start by illuminate a sodium lamp at the end of the collimator the lamp be put a close a possible to the slit a the light intensity increase via the inverse square law a you move the lamp closer this ensures that the brightest pattern be obtain also applies with the hydrogen lamp a slit then become visible in the telescope when in line with the collimator and so the collimator be adjust until focus now the spectrometer be focus it next need to be align to do this first the telescope be move precisely 90 degree around from the point where the crosshairs be on the slit a mirror be then place into the grate table and the table be rotate until the slit be again visible in the telescope at this point the telescope be return 90 degree and the grate table be rotate 45 degree the reading on the spectrometer should now be note a this be the reference `` zero `` point instead of a mirror in the grate table the chosen grate be then insert and a 78.8 line per mm grate be found to be most suit in find the optimal number of spectral line next the grate table need to be parallel with the spectrometer to do this the pattern be observe in the telescope and the height of the table be adjust until all the line in the series be at the same height a well a this remember to the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen lamp the sodium lamp be use for set up a be it bright and the hydrogen lamp get too hot if left on for long period of time which be not ideal during calibration of the equipment when measure diffraction angle it be ensure to not leave the hydrogen lamp on too long to avoid it become too hot and spectral line too dim in our experiment there be three visible colour of line these be from 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 and be produce by emission of certain energy photon and be part of the balmer series these line be measure until they be no longer clearly visible either side of the central maximum this produce four line either side of the central maximum for each colour and the angle at which the line be present be measure the grate spectrometer use have a vernier scale and so care be make to use it correctly a the number on it be small and hard to read after a long period of use some of the line in the telescope become hard to resolve and to distinguish colour and so the hydrogen lamp would be turn off and wait to cool this be to ensure that no line be miss during observation reduce the chance of outlier in our result from figure 3 you can see that the wavelength of the aqua light be much closer to the blue to alpha a the linear fit be much closer together this be because a previously mention from 3 a you move far away from the nucleus of hydrogen the energy level energy get closer together by and inverse square law and so the p=4 and p=5 energy level energy be closer than the p=3 and p=4 this lead to possible confusion between the aqua and blue line a not only be they close together but be also of similar colour this be a possible source of random error in the experiment and so great effort be make to distinguish between line by not keep the hydrogen lamp on for too long once all angle have be record dsin𝜃 against n be plot for red aqua and blue from 6 the gradient of this plot be equal to the wavelength of the photon emit and the graph should show a linear relationship with these wavelength 2 be then use to calculate the rydberg constant 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 wavelength be thus found to equal 657.0 ± 1 n𝑚 −1 491.3 ± 1 n𝑚 −1 and 443.5 ± another possible source of error could be in the diffraction grate in that it could be dirty thus diffract the light slightly or the line in the grate could be slightly not parallel from it manufacture this be a problem a in the derivation of 6 it be assume that there be a constant slit separation to reduce the chance for these source of error the grate should be thoroughly clean before use a well a this different brand grate should be use this ensures that the slit be perfectly parallel thus reduce the chance of that systematic error use the wavelength and 2 rydberg constant for 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 be found to be 10950000 ± 200000 𝑚 −1 10850000 ± 300000 𝑚 −1 and 10730000 ± 300000 𝑚 −1 give a mean value of 𝑅 ∞ 10850000 ± 90000 𝑚 −1 which be 1.088 away from the accepted value of 10973731.568508 𝑚 −1 which have a relative uncertainty of 5.9×10 −12 the investigation be to determine an accurate value of the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer and visible emission spectrum in the balmer series through this experimental procedure the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10850000 ± 90000 𝑚 −1 which be 1.088 away from the accepted value of 10973731.568508 𝑚 −1 which have a relative uncertainty of 5.9×10 −12 the accepted value be outside the suppose uncertainty in the measure value this show there be still step that could be take to ensure a more accurate result to reduce the error in the experiment the whole method should be repeat use a completely different set of equipment thus ensure the data be reproducible furthermore it ensures that there be no systematic bias in the set of equipment that be originally be use it also reduces the chance of unavoidable human error cause anomalous result in the data finally proven in the appendix there be another fourth violet emission 𝐻 𝛿 in the balmer series which be in the visible spectrum it be from transition from the 6 th energy level it would be beneficial to measure this a it give u more data thus reduce uncertainty in the value of the calculate rydberg constant it be however difficult for the human eye to distinguish and so a charge-coupled device would need to be add the fine structure constant α can be far express by other physical constant 7 the error propagation be conduct by the use the follow equation where 𝜎 𝑚 be the best estimate of random error in the mean 𝜎 𝑛−1 be the sample standard deviation and n be the

the wavelength of the photon and so therefore the rydberg constant which link the wavelength of emit photon from the atom to the change in energy level of it electron three value of this constant r ∞ be found by observe the emission line from an electron drop from n=3,4,5 down to n=2 balmer series and these result be concordant give a value of r ∞ =10,562,000±326,000m -1 5sf when electron in an atom be excite they be promote to a high energy level and rapidly drop back down since the energy of each level be precisely define the energy change from each drop in energy level will also come in precise value due to conservation law this energy will be release in the form of a photon -but how will we know what the wavelength would be it can be show that for an energy level in a hydrogen atom n=n the energy of an electron in this level will be proportional to 1 𝑛 2 1 therefore if an electron be drop from energy level n=n to level n=p the energy of the photon would be proportional to 1 𝑛 2 − 1 𝑝 2 for the follow experiment we will let p=2 and so p 2 =4 2 we now have energy e constant × 1 by define the rydberg constant to be 𝑅 ∞ − 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 ℎ𝑐 we now have 2 observe the spectral line upon observe the different line we would see a variety of colour the most clearly visible be red blue and indigo on the spectrum therefore before begin to measure diffraction angle we calculate to which value of principal quantum number n each colour correspond it be found that the aforementioned colour correspond to n=3,4 and 5 respectively 5 we note the angle that the vernier scale would read when the telescope be at normal incidence i.e when the angle θ be zero one experimenter would then slowly move the telescope around take care not to miss any line of the colour for which we be look we obtain all result for the red line first then blue then indigo and would align the equipment 's crosshair with the centre of this line they would take the angle note it down and without refer to this result would move the telescope back to the centre and repeat the reading the result would then be compare give some idea of the uncertainty involve 6 the angle on the scale at θ=0 be then subtract from the value give when the line be in the centre of the field of view to give a value of θ for each maximum the result obtain be treat independently for each colour of spectral line to help identify and eliminate any anomalous result due to potential systematic error when measure the angle for a colour we then plot graph use python of sinθ against the order of the fringe m which take integer value the wavelength λ be found by rearrange equation 3 and by exploit the fact that sinθ be directly proportional to m to give the equation where d be the diffraction grate 's slit separation we then rearrange equation 2 to give which will soon be use to find the constant in the follow section the first calculation do be to find the value of d the line separation for the diffraction grate the grate be say to have 300 line per mm and so this give 3×10 5 line m -1 this value could simply be invert to give d -and the answer will be kept in it exact form to avoid unnecessary round error therefore we have a value of 𝑑 1 3×10 5 m. the result obtain for each colour line 's maximum from m=-2 to m=+2 be a follow where m be the order of maximum and θ m and θ s be the angle independently measure by each of u the angle be give in division of sixtieth of a degree because the vernier scale can be read to give angle to the near arc-minute which be the mean and the uncertainty for the angle be numerically found and then sinθ be plot against m to obtain the three follow straight-line graph for the code use to determine the gradient and error see the appendix 6 ideally error bar would be include clearly only for the y-axis give that order m only take integer value but not enough information be collect to quantitatively define these very well see conclusion the gradient for the line be obtain and then multiply by the line separation d a in equation 4 to give value for the wavelength these be then insert into equation 3 which give the follow value of the rydberg constant use the result for the red line rydberg 's constant be 10,987,139. use the result for the blue line rydberg 's constant be 10,934,464. use the result for the indigo line rydberg 's constant be 9,762,914. fortunately although the gradient of the graph may have be inaccurate due to the lack of error bar have 3 independently calculate value of the constant help to provide an alternative way to find the standard error of the result found for the rydberg constant that which corresponds to the value 𝜎 √𝑛 ⁄ the follow calculation be therefore carry out on python to find this constants=sp.array

therefore found rydberg 's constant to be 10561505.7362 with a standard error of 326259.849914 we be force to consider whether the result for indigo should be discard from the final calculation because they be below the other 2 result that be far more concordant with each other if this low value be cause by an error this would most likely be a systematic error consider the very low deviation of point from the line of best fit on the graph for indigo however since only three result be obtain for the constant we deem it unreasonable to consider this result an outlier especially since it be clearly of a similar enough magnitude to the other value so eventually by use all three of the above result our final value of the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10,562,000 ± 326,000 m -1 5sf the accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10,973,732m -1 whereas my experimental value come out a 10,562,000±326,000m -1 my maximum would therefore be 10,888,000m -1 which would still be just below the true 7 value but be not too distant the percentage error be -4 1sf which be in fact relatively small the relatively high accuracy could be consider to be down to the equipment include the very fine vernier scale and the very fine and carefully align crosshairs use to orientate the telescope there could be many potential reason for inaccuracy however include many systematic error these may in particular may have played a part in cause the value of 𝑅 ∞ from the indigo line to be low than the mean of the other two result in fact by 11 a possibility for this could be the misalignment of the spectrometer it could easily have be knock by other student walk past and we do not check in between our reading that the alignment be correct an argument against this be the cause could be that for m=0 on the indigo graph θ be a close if not closer to zero than be θ on the graph for the first two colour observedwe must therefore look to other cause it could be possible that although the high care be put into ensure that the hydrogen lamp be not left on for more than ten minute at a time there be no evidence against this mistake have accidentally be make before and during the collection of result for the indigo fringe the increase temperature of the lamp do not cause it to turn off but instead could have heat the air around it and decrease the surround pressure lead to diffraction of the photon emit a they pas through region of different pressure even before reach the grate this would give a different value of θ and therefore of 𝑅 ∞ the increase temperature may also have affected humidity -again affect diffraction another systematic error would include any slight change in lamp position although the slit remain at the same orientation a the telescope assume no problem here light would still be come in at a slightly different angle if the lamp itself be to the side another error could be confusion of the fringe with background light which be unlikely because of the clear straight-line trend show for each graph or even with other faint nearby diffraction maximum from other energy level change -or even other heat element near the lamp a for uncertainty calculation this would have be much improve by consider the actual width of the diffraction fringe -which a a matter of fact turn out to be considerably wider than the area cover by the crosshair 8 this would have give a much well estimate of the spread of value that could possibly be obtain when take result rather than compare the two experimenter result when find the angle at the fringe 's 'middle the uncertainty be therefore not found a accurately a possible -especially with the lack of error bar -but the value of 𝑅 ∞ stayed relatively true to the expect value without too large a standard error of the mean found by σ⁄√n which suggest that the experimental method be relatively reliable\"\n"," \"pectroscopy be the study of the spectrum of light and how it change a light interacts with matter a

these line be show in table i. forty-five year after the discovery of the fraunhofer line it be found by kirchoff and bunsen that the line coincide with the emission spectrum of element they theorise that since the light from the sun originates from fusion reaction in it core it must pa through the atmosphere where some wavelength be absorbed by element such a hydrogen this process be discus far in part b of section ii the theory section of this report this process be what cause the dark line to appear in the spectrum of the sun when view from the earth the grate spectrometer investigate fraunhofer line s the diffraction grate produce point of constructive and destructive interference at angle base on the wavelength of the light diffract through the grate a diagram of light travel through a grate can be see in fig 1. note that for an actual grate there be many more beam of light than the two show in fig 1. however by symmetry the light will interfere constructively at the same angle for all beam therefore this diagram can be use to determine the relationship between angle and wavelength a can be see in fig 1 the upper beam will travel a great optical path length than the low beam from trigonometry it can be see that this path difference will be equal to the slit separation multiply by the sine of the diffraction angle for constructive interference the optical path difference must be equal to an integer number of wavelength this give the relationship between the angle for constructive interference and the wavelength of light passing through the grate 𝑚𝜆 𝑑 sin 𝜃

these radius correspond to specific energy the low energy radius be closer to the nucleus of atom for an electron to transition between these energy level it must receive or lose all the energy instantaneously when this happens the electron usually emits or absorbs light a see in fig 2. the energy gap between orbitals vary from element to element this mean that the set of energy require to

δ𝐸 be the energy difference between the two energy level and c be the speed of light which be approximately 3 × 10 8 𝑚 • 𝑠 −1 it follow from 5 that if every element have a unique set of energy gap

slit separation of approximately 1.269 × 10 −5 𝑚. the main angle scale be comprise of separation of half a degree and the vernier read in arc minute to set up the apparatus for this experiment the grate be remove from the holder the eyepiece be then focus onto the crosshair such that it appear on an image 5-10m from the camera this be do in order to reduce eye strain a light source be then pas through the slit the camera be rotate such that the beam of light be centre on the crosshair the collimator be then focus so that a sharp image of the slit appear in the eyepiece the camera 's angle be adjust after focus to ensure that the crosshair be centre on the slit the holder in the kit use could be regulate at any angle relative to the slit for this experiment the holder have to be parallel to the slit to ensure normal incidence on the grate to do this the angle scale be use to rotate the eyepiece 90 degree from the central beam a mirror be place in the grate holder and the turntable be adjust such that grate reflect light from the slit directly into the crosshair on the eyepiece a the camera and the slit be exactly perpendicular it be then know that the mirror and therefore the holder be exactly 45 degree from the beam the scale could then be use to rotate the turntable 45 degree and the telescope 90degrees so that the light take a normal path through the spectrometer the angle on the scale be take a the `` zero `` for the experiment to take reading the light be pas through the slit and the telescope could be rotate such that the crosshair appear on the centre of the slit the angle difference between the `` zero `` angle and the angle on the scale give the value of 𝜃 for that peak a hydrogen lamp be position in front of the slit to obtain the hydrogen alpha wavelength for the metal use a salt be burn next to the slit allow light to pa through the slit the blowtorch be use to burn the metal salt a it burn at very high temperature with little visible light emission when use the blowtorch safety glass be use and the flame be kept far away from any person the data in this experiment be handle in python by the `` scipy `` function `` polyfit `` the `` polyfit `` function allows for a weight factor to be inputted into the parameter for every data point therefore to obtain more accurate value in the gradient the reciprocal of the uncertainty be use a weight factor the uncertainty give in the gradient by python be take a the random error in the final value for the hydrogen lamp the data in table ii be obtain when the hydrogen lamp be place at the slit red and blue line be observe through the lens the red line correspond to the hydrogen-\\uf061 wavelength the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m -6 to m 6 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table ii be plot in python to give the graph in fig 4. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0519 \\uf0b1 0.0005. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0519 × 1.269 × 10 −5 6 6.58 x 10^-7m fig 3. the grate spectrometer the light pas through the slit and then becomes parallel after passing through the collimator the grate the diffracts the light where it can be focus and view through the camera and eyepiece the diffraction angle can be read off the turntable if the camera/eyepiece be rotate such that the diffraction beam be centre on the crosshair the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃. to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.94 this give an absolute error of around ±6𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 658 ± 6 𝑛𝑚 this value corresponds to fraunhofer line c which have a wavelength of 656.6nm this result be strong evidence for the presence of hydrogen in the atmosphere of the sun in order to more thoroughly check for the presence of hydrogen the wavelength of hydrogen-\\uf062 and hydrogen-\\uf067 could be determine if they be found in the fraunhofer line then this would prove to a much high certainty that the fraunhofer line be cause by light absorption from element in the sun 's atmosphere and that hydrogen be one of them for the sodium chloride salt the data in table iii be obtain when the sodium chloride be burn next to the slit orange line be see through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be again approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m -4 to m 4 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table iii be plot in python to give the graph in fig 5. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0465 \\uf0b1 0.0003. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0465 × 1.269 × 10 −5 7 5.90 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.71 this give an absolute error of around ±4𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 590 ± 4 𝑛𝑚 this value corresponds to fraunhofer line d which be a doublet of wavelength of 589nm and 589.6nm this result would suggest that there be likely to be a presence of sodium in the sun 's atmosphere although the fraunhofer line have a doublet of wavelength only one be see in the spectrometer if a high resolution spectrometer be use then the presence of two line could be confirm to give the best possible chance of see two line with the apparatus use several change could be make a brighter sodium lamp could be use instead of a flame a this will produce a more reliable spectrum a bright lamp would also allow for a small slit which would decrease the overlap of the two line decrease the slit space would also spread the spectrum more make the two wavelength more distinct for the copper sulphate salt the data in table iv be obtain when the copper sulphate be burn the light emit be diffuse and not very bright the light see through the lens be very spread out meaning the collimator may not have be able to make all the light beam parallel the error from the width of the peak and the parallax error be much large than for the other three at 40 arc minute peak from m -5 to m 5 be visible through the eyepiece the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃. to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 40 ′ ≈ 0.9428° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃. to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero the data from table iv be plot in python to give the graph in fig 6. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0420 \\uf0b1 0.0017. from 3 we find 𝜆=0.042× 1.269 ×10−5 8 5.33 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 4.06 this give an absolute error of around ±20𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 530 ± 20 𝑛𝑚 the range of copper wavelength do correspond to fraunhofer line e which have a wavelength of 527nm however the uncertainty in the wavelength be too high to be certain that the wavelength of copper match with this line also due to what be know about star formation it be unlikely that there be high amount of copper in the sun 's atmosphere a repeat of this experiment would require a more accurate way of get the emission spectrum of copper for example burning a more flammable salt with a large flame a more sophisticated spectrometer could also be use for the lithium salt the data in table v be obtain when the lithium salt be burn next to the slit a red line be observe through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute .. peak from m -4 to m 4 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table v be plot in python to give the graph in fig 7. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0528 \\uf0b1 0.0005. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0528 × 1.269 × 10 −5 6 6.71x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.99 this give an absolute error of around ±7𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 671 ± 7 𝑛𝑚 this value do not correspond to any fraunhofer line suggest little presence of lithium in the sun 's atmosphere it would seem odd that little lithium can be found in the sun 's atmosphere a it should be more easily fuse than for example sodium although the technique give good result for hydrogen and sodium the spectrum of lithium should be checked use a different method in order to verify that the wavelength measure be correct the aim of this experiment be to determine the wavelength of the element hydrogen sodium copper and lithium and to compare these to the fraunhofer line in order to determine the chemical composition of the sun 's atmosphere the wavelength found be hydrogen -𝜆 658 ± 6 𝑛𝑚 copper -𝜆 530 ± 20 𝑛𝑚 lithium -𝜆 671 ± 7 𝑛𝑚 when compare to the fraunhofer line it be found that hydrogen and sodium be present in the solar atmosphere copper and lithium be not found in the solar atmosphere however more experimentation should be carry out before this be know for certain the result from this experiment show that it be possible to determine the chemical composition of distant object through analysis of their spectrum this could be use to check for the presence of the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃 the measurement itself and the `` zero angle `` to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero every element not only on the sun but also on other star in our galaxy\"\n"," \"this report examines the use of a grate spectrometer to analyse the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom from a hydrogen lamp source three different colour spectrum in the balmer series be observe due to the high precision of the spectrometer the wavelength of the emission line and therefore the energy change accompany each transition be able to be determine very accurately by compare these value to the theoretical energy change in the balmer series the exact energy level transition be able to be identify for every colour spectrum the rydberg constant be then calculate to be 1.099 ± 0.010 × 10 7 m −1 use the rydberg equation spectroscopy be the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation 1 each element have a unique emission spectrum so spectroscopy be a useful tool for identify unknown element emission spectrum arise from the de-excitation of an electron from a high energy state to a low energy state and the simultaneous emission of electromagnetic radiation the frequency of light emit be proportional to the energy difference between the two state a discrete range of wavelength of radiation be emit due to the quantisation of electron energy level which make up the emission spectrum atom of different element have distinct energy level therefore the emission spectrum of every element be different although the hydrogen atom contains only 1 electron that usually occupies the ground state there be many empty high energy orbitals after the electron be excite to a high energy level it drop to a low state and emits electromagnetic radiation the balmer series refers to the series of spectral emission line that be characterise by transition to energy level with principle quantum number n 2 from n 2 4 of these transition result in the emission of radiation in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum however only 3 be able to be resolve clearly in this experiment 2 the colour observe be red blue and purple in the late 19th century johann jakob balmer become the first physicist to empirically describe the appearance of spectral line johannes rydberg generalise this with the rydberg equation for all hydrogen transition not just to n 2 in 1888 3 this in turn lead to the establishment of the lyman paschen and brackett series it be important to note that the rydberg equation be a strictly empirical equation and the interpretation of the hydrogen emission spectrum in term of electronic structure be not formalise until niels bohr developed his semi-classical model of the atom in 1913 3 the semi-classical bohr model use classical mechanic to describe the circular motion of electron but they could only take certain quantise value of energy depend on orbital distance the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom yield the same result a bohr 's semi-classical approach so although the bohr model be somewhat incorrect see fig 1 it be sufficient to allow the correct relationship between quantum number and electron energy level in hydrogen to be derive an electron of mass m be assume to follow a circular orbit around the nucleus at an arbitrary radius r and speed v so the centripetal and electrostatic force can be equate 5 for a hydrogen atom with only a single proton and electron with charge of magnitude e where o be the permittivity of free space bohr postulate that the angular momentum of the electron could only take discrete value i.e it be quantise where n be the principle quantum number and h be the reduce planck 's constant by rearrange and equate equation 1 and 2 the radius of the orbit electron be give by 5 where h be planck 's constant the total energy of the electron e n be the sum of the kinetic energy and electrical potential energy which after rearrangement be give by 5 clearly the electron only take certain discrete value of energy which be proportional to the reciprocal of the principle quantum number square equation 4gives the energy level of the hydrogen atom it be important to note that bohr derive this result prior to the formal establishment of quantum mechanic which involves solve the schrödinger equation for a hydrogen atom in spherical polar co-ordinate 6 the energy difference e between the high energy level n and low energy level p be equivalent to the energy emit due to the transition planck 's law state that e hc λ where c be the speed of light and λ be the wavelength of light the relationship between λ and the principle quantum number n be therefore the rydberg constant r ∞ be define in term of fundamental constant a finally the rydberg equation be give by 4 the balmer series of wavelength be obtain when p

light ray be parallel before reach the diffraction grate which disperse the light the disperse spectrum be then focus by a camera lens onto the crosshair with a magnify image view with the eyepiece the grate platform and telescope could be rotate and be mount on a vernier scale the main scale be in increment of 0.5 • and the vernier scale be in arcminute this meant that the precision of the spectrometer be 1 arcminute set up the spectrometer carefully be vital to eliminate systematic error in diffraction angle and to produce a clear image this ensure that precise measurement could be take in order to produce the sharpest image possible • the eyepiece be carefully focus on the crosshair which be set to an x orientation • the camera lens be focus on a far away object by look out of a window • the telescope be then rotate opposite to the collimator the collimator focus be adjust without alter the camera focus such that a sharp image of the slit could be see the diffraction grate need to be exactly perpendicular to the hydrogen lamp source such that light ray from the source be collimate and that there be no path difference before passing through the grate to do this • the telescope be place directly opposite to the collimator with the grate remove such that the slit be see on the crosshair use the vernier scale on the spectroscope the telescope be rotate through 90 • and a mirror be place in the grate holder • the grate platform be adjust such that light be reflect into the eyepiece this meant that the orientation of the grate platform be 45 • from both the telescope and the collimator • the grate platform be then rotate exactly through 45 • use the vernier scale a reference so that it be exactly perpendicular to the collimator the telescope could be move around to observe a diffraction pattern when the mirror be replace by a 80 line per mm diffraction grate • the grate platform be adjust such that the grate ruling be parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope the telescope be move into the position where the crosshair coincide with the central bright maximum which appear a a mixture of the red blue and purple light the angle of the central maximum be record and use a the reference point from which the angle θ be record for each visible fringe by rotate the telescope until the crosshair align with the line the red and blue fringe be bright and fairly easy to see although they be more space out than the purple fringe the purple fringe be quite dim and several order could not be see with the telescope include order -2 -3 and +3 for the other purple fringe it be often challenge to see the crosshair against the purple so there be a great uncertainty for these reading additionally the hydrogen lamp gradually heat up and light intensity decrease which meant that it be even harder to see the already dim purple fringe when the lamp be close to overheat the lamp be place very close to the slit so the effect of other light source be negligible all the order that could be see clearly be record for all the colour from -4 to +5 for red -5 to +7 for blue and -5 to +5 for purple exclude the miss order a state before the precision of the spectrometer be 1 arcminute however there be a variation in reading for the vernier scale each reading be therefore repeat twice with the average value take a the angle the uncertainty be take to be the standard error of the mean it be found that the provide diffraction grate have a different number of line per millimeter than be indicate by the supplier approximately 78.8 lines/mm 4 this value be use to calculate the slit separation d. by plot a graph of dsinθ against order m for each of the colour the wavelength of the light emit during each transition could be determine by find the gradient use equation 4 the theoretical energy value of each energy level can be deduce and compare to the experimental value which be calculate by inputting the measure wavelength into planck 's law the theoretical energy emit be calculate from table 1. have identify which transition each wavelength of light correspond to the reciprocal of the wavelength be plot against 1 n 2 − 1 p 2 where p 2 due to it be from the balmer series from the rydberg equation 8 the magnitude of the gradient be equal to the rydberg constant the absolute value of the gradient be 1.099 ± 0.010 × 10 7 m −1 from equation 7 the theoretical value of the rydberg constant be 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 meaning that the experimentally determine value be within 0.25 of the true value a grate spectrometer be use to observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen 3 balmer series transition correspond to light emit in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum red blue and purple fringe be observe by measure the angle of the fringe relative to the central bright maximum their wavelength be able to be determine a well a the energy change due to the transition due to the high precision of the instrument accurate and precise value be obtain for the wavelength by use the rydberg equation and plot the graph of the reciprocal of the wavelength against the difference between the reciprocal of the square of the 2 electron energy level that be transition between a highly accurate value of the rydberg constant be calculate 1.099 ± 0.010 × 10 7 m −1 within 0.25 of the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m −1\"\n"," \"the rydberg constant relates the wavelength of a photon emit by an electron to the electron jump from a high to a low energy shell in order to obtain it value experimentally the light emit by a hydrogen lamp be diffract and the observable spectral line be compare to their correspond electron jump the result be r∞ 11000000 ± 26000m −1 which be large than the agree value by 0.249 i n 1888 a formula describe the wavelength of emit light from hydrogen like element be determine empirically by the swedish physicist johannes rydberg it incorporate a constant call the rydberg constant r ∞ with a value of 10973731.6m −1 ref 1 25 year later the rutherford-bohr atom model be publish and r ∞ be derive from more fundamental constant to determine the value of the rydberg constant experimentally we inspect spectral line create by hydrogen with a grate spectrometer simultaneously the formula relate the wavelength to the electron energy shell jump rydberg formula be test for validity accord to huygen 's principle a light wave encounter a grate start create new circular wave these then interfere with each other and create observable maximum and minimum two adjacent slit in a grate form a double slit it can be therefore use a a simplify model fig 1 fig 1. a planar light beam encounter a double slit and create two circular wave every blue line corresponds to a crest wavefront the distance between two adjacent line be therefore equal to the wavelength λ. the red line represent a sample of the create maximum by interference s 1 and s 2 be path that light have to travel from each slit to create a maximum a maximum can only be create if two crest interfere with each other thus s 1 and s 2 have to be multiple of the wavelength in a grate the distance between two adjacent slit d be very small when compare to s 1 and s 2 thus it might be assume that the two path be parallel fig 2 a the difference in θ between them be negligible a forward travel light wave can be described a ψ e i ωt−kx where k be define to be the wave vector and ω the wave angular frequency assume that x be in the direction of the two diffract beam then the ray in fig 2 can be define a 1 where 1 represent the amplitude with respect to location of beam 1 and 2 represent beam 2 by incorporate the additional distance of d sin θ in order to form a maximum the two wave must interfere with their crest so that the phase difference of the two wavefunctions should be a multiple m of their wavelength λ mλ arg ψ 2 − arg ψ 1 and thus for the order number m ... −2 −1 0 1 2 ... the angle θ for each create maximum be therefore only dependent on the slit width and the wavelength of the diffract light because the inspect light might consist of several wavelength their interference pattern might overlap reduce d prevents this a θ would increase for small value the most suitable atom model to obtain the rydberg constant r ∞ be the bohr model accord to which electron orbit around a positively charge and very heavy nucleus whilst be on a specific energy shell fig 3 the result centrifugal force f cent be then equal and opposite to the attractive coulomb force f coul so that the electron stay in it orbit those electron be able to move from high to low energy shell by emit energy in the form of photon and move to high energy shell by gain energy 2 the far the shell from the nucleus the more energy the orbit electron have fig 3 an equation for the wavelength of an emit photon by an electron jumping from a shell n to a shell p can be derive by use a force ansatz so that f cent f coul and thus − where z be the number of proton in the nucleus and k 1 4π 0 thus v n and r n be the velocity and radius of the electron 's movement on the n'th energy shell and m e be the electron mass this result in accord to bohr the angular momentum of every electron can be described a l n h 2π where h represent planck 's constant this be equal to the product of the electron 's moment of inertia and it angular frequency n h 2π m e r 2 n vn rn thus by substitute equation 5 into 4 r n can be define a 6 in order to determine the total energy of an electron on the nth shell e n it kinetic and potential energy need to be add the potential energy e p ot be equal to the integral from r n to ∞ over f coul with respect to r. thus rn the kinetic energy e kin can be found by divide equation 4 by 2 and so e kin kz e 2 2rn hence 2r n so if an electron jump from the n'th shell onto the p'th shell it release energy of ∆e −kz e 2 2rn − −kz e 2 2rp by substitute equation 6 the release energy be described a the energy of a photon be give by e p h hf h c λ where c be the speed of light f be the photon 's frequency and λ be the photon 's wavelength due to energy conservation e p h ∆e thus where r ∞ denotes the rydberg constant hydrogen have only one proton in it nucleus z 1 hence a hydrogen lamp creates an electrostatic field which excites electron from the hydrogen and increase their kinetic energy those electron then lose their additional energy and jump to low energy shell by emit a photon only some jump create visible wavelength which be know a the balmer series fig 5 the setup be first adjust with a sodium lamp so that the collimator the grate and the telescope ax be align for θ 0 180 o where m 0 which have to be then subtract from every measurement of the diffraction angle additionally m and θ be define to be positive in the direction up from m 0 fig 5 and negative in the opposite direction the hydrogen lamp be place a close to the slit a possible to minimise the effect of ambient light a grate with 300 line per 1mm be chosen for the experiment a accord to equation 3 the high the density of slit the easy it be to distinguish two close line from each other however a grate with a high line density could not be use a θ be become too large to be properly measure and the observe spectral line to faint at m 0 a pink/violet line could be observe fig 6a this be a combination of all the other observable colour furthermore dark blue fig 6b turquoise fig 6c and red fig 6d spectral line be observe also a very faint purple line be see but it be to faint to be record and be therefore exclude from measurement preliminary all three observe colour seem to fit into the balmer series see section iib the edge of those line be perceive a much sharper by our eye the blurriness in fig 6 be a result of bad camera quality and therefore do not affect the actual measurement quality accord to equation 3 θ be approximately proportional to λ for small value so the far a spectral line be away from m 0 the large be it wavelength therefore the correspond photon have less energy a e p h h c λ simultaneously the wavelength for each colour be determine by plot m against sin θ fig 7 a linear regression be the best approximation for the collect data for all data point intercept the regression line with their errorbars so small that not visible in graph thus equation 3 be corroborate and the slope of the linear regession be then equal to d λ where d 1mm 300 the wavelength be therefore the product of the correspond slope and 1mm 300 accord to the spectrum of visible light these wavelength roughly correspond to the observe colour in fig 6 and also to the colour emit in the balmer series fig 4 have value of λ and correspond n equation 8 can be use to determine r ∞ so λ −1 should be proportional to − 1 n 2 − 1 p 2 where p 2 and the slope would be then equal to r ∞ fig 8 the three data point align so that a justified linear regression can be conduct the result function have a y-intercept of 5700 ± 4800m −1 it should however go through the origin in order to show proportionality it value be dominate by the scale use for the y-axis the intercept can be thus neglect and a direct proportionality between the two ax can be assume a a result equation 8 be verify the slope of the function be then equal to the rydberg constant a built in vernier scale be use to measure the angle θ whose small unit be 1 arcminute 1 60 o hence the uncertainty of the measure angle be half of it σ θ 1 120 o however the observe spectral line have a certain width and the cross wire be aim at their estimate middle but this width increase the uncertainty of θ fig 9 in order to fig 9. representation of the measurement of a red spectral line on the left-hand side the cross wire be aim at the estimate middle to obtain θ. on the right-hand side the cross wire be aim at each side of the spectral line to determine ∆θ calculate the correspond error the angle of both edge of the spectral line be measure and ∆θ be then calculate for every colour for every m. the measurement error of 1 120 o be incorported a a measurement error into the calculation ∆θ be then divide by 2 a the deviation from the centre of the line can be at most only half of it width the measurement error of each possible deviation from the centre be then add to the value to simulate the large deviation this be then define a the new σ θ all value in the appendix this uncertainty of θ also incorporates the diffraction cause be the collimator and the telescope a both use glass lens the slit be well align with the lens for the centre of all wavelength for m 0 be at θ 180 o hence the lens diffraction only influence the width of the strip and not their location however for certainty all the measurement be take quickly so that the refractive index of the surround air would not change significantly due to temperature or pressure change additionally no ambient light be shin whilst the measurement be take to increase the visibility of the spectral line in fig 7 all linear regression have a small negative yintercept but they all should be theoretically equal to zero thus a systematical error might have occur low the measure value of θ. the most probable origin of this error be an inaccurate calibration of the spectrometer small value of λ would lead then to large value of λ −1 and would thus explain the positive intercept in fig 8. the official value of r ∞ be 10973731.6m −1 ref 1 our experimentally determine value be however 11000000 ± 26000m −1 the official number do therefore not lie within the value of the obtain r ∞ it be however very close a it be small by only 0.239 hence the official value of the rydberg constant be not verify by this experiment the result be very precise with an uncertainty of only 0.236 however the slope obtain from fig 8 be strongly influence by random error a only three point define the linear regression hence the validity of the result would be increase by inspect a broader span of emit photon wavelength the aim of this experiment be to determine r ∞ with a spectrometer by inspect the balmer series emit by a hydrogen lamp with a result of r ∞ 11000000±26000m −1 we be able to proof the rydberg formula however the official value of the constant be not verify the grate spectrometer be a very precise measurement technique a the final uncertainty be very small it be however prone to random error the observable spectrum be limited to the visible spectrum of electromagnetic wave between 390 and 700nm a change of the measurement device would allow gathering more data and thus the validity of the result would increase\"\n"," \"this experiment be conduct to determine the rydberg constant by use the emission spectrum

different wave length have different diffraction angle which separate light by their wavelength so that wavelength of emit light can be measure wavelength of light emit by an atom be call emission spectrum it be in 1855 that the emission spectrum line of hydrogen atom be precisely measure by j. j. balmer and lyman it be found to be regular and conclude into an equation call balmer equation by the former the equation be an empirical formula which show that the wavelength of the emit light by a hydrogen atom be related to 1/𝑛 2 where n be any positive integer great than 3. and the equation be developed by rydberg into rydberg equation which be consist with a wider range of spectrum over next few decade and rydberg constant be therefore introduce to fit the equation but the meaning of the equation the constant and the emission spectrum still could not be interpret until the establishment of bohr model of hydrogen atom bohr explain that the emission of light be due to the transition of electron 's energy level and the energy of emit photon equal to the change in electron 's potential energy since energy level of electron be quantize the atom can only release light with certain wave length and the rydberg constant be later deduce by bohr use his model and plank 's photon theory with 0.05 percent of error which be interpret because of the atom movement in this experiment emission spectrum of hydrogen lamp be measure through grate spectrometer and the rydberg constant be calculate figure 1 1 spectrometer theory with light passing through grate in spectrometer principal maximum occurs when light that go through all slit have instruction interference which be to say that light passing through every slit have a phase difference of 2nπ with the light passing through the neighbor slit where n be any integer δ𝜙 2𝑛𝜋 1 where δ𝜙 be phase difference between two light wave which can be also express a δ𝑟 be denote a path difference and 𝜆 be wavelength the path difference can be farther express a where d be the separation between slit which be where n be number of slit per meter and 𝜃 be diffraction angle therefore and n represent order of maximum which be to say from equation 5 it can be told that light with different wavelength have different diffraction angle therefore a mixture of light with different wavelength can be separate through a grate and wavelength of each light can be determine by the linear relationship between diffraction angle and order of maximum a mention before rydberg equation describes the relationship between the wavelength of emit light and the correspondent change in energy level in hydrogen atom accord to bohr 's equation for energy level the total energy of an electron be and plank 's photon theory the photon energy be where 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of electron e be charge per electron and n be energy level of the electron the photon energy should equal the change in energy level therefore where n and p be final and initial energy level the equation can be rearrange into which mean where r be call rydberg constant figure 2 2 grate spectrometer the grate spectrometer be set up and calibrate by several step the telescope be first focus around 1 meter far the adjustable slit be then narrow a sodium lamp be place in front of the slit the telescope be adjust so that the crosswire inside the telescope be align with the slit the telescope then be turn exactly 90 degree by the vernier angular scale and clamped and a diffraction grate with 78.8 line per meter be set on the turn table the turntable be rotate until the crosswire of the telescope be again align with the fringe of the slit from the reflection of the grate then the telescope be unclamped and rotate exactly 90 degree back the turn table be rotate exactly 45 degree and clamped the reading on vernier scale be record a central angle 𝜃 0 which for this experiment be 96.17 degree turn the telescope the fringe of sodium lamp light can then be observe through the telescope the sodium lamp be then replace by a hydrogen lamp turn the telescope red green and purple fringe be observe for fringe with each color the rotation angle show by the vernier meter and order of maximum be record and for each fringe the width be measure a the error there should be more color but be unobservable 1. for date of each color the fit line between order of maximum and the sine function of change in rotation angle to central angle 𝜃 0 be drawn slop of fit line of red blue and purple be 0.05083±0.00018 0.03836±0.00018 0.03482±0.00005 respectively accord to equation 5 the wavelength be the slope time d which be 1.27e-05 m. thus wavelength calculate for red blue and purple fringe be 645.0±2.3nm 486.8±2.3nm 442.0±0.6nm use the wavelength with correspond initial and final energy level rydberg constant can be calculate with equation 10 the initial and final energy level for red blue and purple light be 2 and 3 4 5 10773444.4 ± 12520.1𝑚 −1 in this experiment the spectrum of hydrogen atom be analyze use grate spectrometer hydrogen lamp be use a the source through the spectrometer three colors-red blue and purple-were observe for each color diffraction angle through the grate and order of maximum be measure and use to calculate wavelength wavelength calculate for red blue and purple be 645.0±2.3nm 486.8±2.3nm 442.0±0.6nm wavelength than be use to deduce the rydberg constant use equation 5 result calculate use red spectrum be 11161664.7 ± 40600.2𝑚 −1 blue be 10956139.2 ± 51453.5𝑚 −1 and purple be 10773444.4 ± 12520.1𝑚 −1 the theoretical value calculate by bohr use equation 1 be 1.0967758×10 7 m -1 the rydberg constant be of a great importance since it be coincide with bohr 's theoretical value it prof bohr 's and plank 's quantum theory to be true lead the world into a quantum age\"\n"," \"the rydberg constant be a constant which appear in atomic physic it be use when describe the wavelength of light in numerous spectral line series in a hydrogen atom particularly the balmer series although the value of this constant have be determine before we would like to provide some experimental validation for this ultimately our setup make use of a diffraction grate and spectrometer and by the principle of superposition generates a fringe pattern which we can observe position of principle maximum be related to the wavelength of the emit light and alongside knowledge of the balmer series a value for the rydberg constant can be calculate the value we obtain from this experiment to three significant figure be 1.10x10 7 m -1 with a statistical error of approximately 2.6 systematic error contribution will be discus in detail in section 4. however we attempt to control these in our experiment and this be confirm in our result a it be close to the true value of the rydberg constant the rydberg constant be first introduce a a proportionality constant relate the wavelength of light from the atomic line spectrum of a hydrogen atom to the quantum number correspond to the energy level that the electron transition this be call the rydberg formula and can also be apply to heavier element niels bohr show that the rydberg constant could be express in term of more fundamental constant 1 where me be the rest mass of the electron e be the elementary charge on the electron εo be the permittivity of free space h be the planck constant and c be the speed of light in a vacuum to determine a value for the rydberg constant our experimental setup u a spectrometer a spectrometer be a device which show light intensity depend on it wavelength or frequency the incident light be spread out by a diffraction grate but a prism can also be use both result in a spectrum but this will be discus far in section 2. an article from 1988 title 'precision measurement of the rydberg constant by d h mcintyre and t w hänsch suggest that the accuracy of the rydberg constant have be improve beyond 1 part in 10 9 nowadays the constant have an uncertainty of less than 7 part in 10 12 1 we do n't expect to achieve this level of accuracy in our experiment but it give an idea of how well-determined this constant be the energy of an electron which be bound in a hydrogen atom can only take discrete value this be one way of say that the electron 's energy be 'quantised when an electron fall from a high energy state to a low energy state a photon of energy equivalent to difference in energy state be release this photon also have an associate wavelength the rydberg formula be one illustration of this and be show in equation 1 2 where λ be the wavelength of the emit light r∞ be the rydberg constant for hydrogen n and p be integer which represent the low and upper energy state respectively this experiment be concerned with electron which fall to the n=2 energy state a some of the emit light have wavelength within the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum this be know a the balmer series and be show in figure 2.1 spectrum of a hydrogen atom in the balmer series 3 red appear furthest to the right and then colour change from aqua to blue to violet a you move towards the left the wavelength of the light decrease but the frequency increase until you reach ultraviolet which be invisible to the naked eye the spectrometer in our experiment be couple with a diffraction grate but a mention earlier a prism may also be use the prism separate the light because different frequency of light be refract by different amount this be call dispersion our diffraction grate act like many equally space slit we know from young 's double-slit experiment that when light pas through two slit an interference pattern be form the light interferes a it pas through the slit because of the path difference and result phase difference of two light ray position of maximum intensity occur when the phase difference of the two ray be an integer multiple of 2π it can be show that position of principle maximum for many slit be described by equation 2 where d be the separation of the slit θ be the angle from the centre to desire maximum m be an integer and represent the order number and λ be the wavelength of the emit light if for example we be interested in position of principle minimum equation 2 would be modify such that the left-hand side would be multiply by n the total number of slit firstly the optical spectrometer have to be set up such that result could be take accurately and reliably this involve ensure that the spectrometer be align such that light hit the diffraction grate at exactly 90º if this be n't the case we would see a very messy fringe pattern it be also necessary to make sure that the eyepiece of the spectrometer be focus on the crosshair and that the camera lens be focus on a distant object the crosshair be much easy to see when be use diagonally these be important because the image need to be clear free from parallax and at a comfortable view distance the experimental setup be show in figure 3.1 on the follow page powerpoint to display the experimental setup of the spectrometer the hydrogen lamp serf a the light source the slit limit the amount of light into the spectrometer the collimator be necessary because it make ray parallel before they enter the diffraction grate the camera lens focus the light ray create an image which be then view through the eyepiece by an observer a diffraction grate of 80 ± 2 line per mm be use to generate the fringe pattern the fringe pattern be observe use the eyepiece and the central maximum be locate this angle be record and take a the zeroth order the main scale on the spectrometer be divide into half of a degree and the vernier scale read in arc minute the angle θ be record a a function of the order m for each transition wavelength result be take either side of the central maximum and multiple result be take to improve reliability a measurement can be take very quickly since the angle θ be measure a a function of order m equation 2 implies that a graph of m versus sin θ should be plot for each transition wavelength this will result in a straight line with a gradient λ/d this be show in figure 4.1 a see in this figure the relationship between m and sin θ be linear for both red and blue light a expect we can see that the slope for blue light be not a steep a the slope for red light we also expect to see this a blue light have a shorter wavelength than red light vertical error bar be quite small this implies a small statistical uncertainty in our gradient and this be confirm when the wavelength with an associate error be calculate for each colour for blue light we determine the wavelength to be 488 ± 12.3 nm for red light the wavelength be determine a 650 ± 17.9 nm with the wavelength know equation 2 can be use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant blue light appear on the emission spectrum because of electron drop down from the n=4 energy state to the n=2 energy state red light appear on the emission spectrum a a result of electron drop down from the n=3 energy state to the n=2 energy state plug these value into equation 2 give u an average value of the rydberg constant a 1.10x10 7 ± 2.90x10 5 m -1 however this do n't account for any systematic error which we may have encounter in the experiment it do minimise random error such a misread the scale on the spectrometer in the low light condition source of systematic error which could have affected our result might include misalignment of the spectrometer position of our hydrogen lamp air pressure humidity and unwanted background light we attempt to control most of these factor throughout the course of our experiment the spectrometer alignment be an important part of the setup and it take u much longer to do it compare with record the data we each try to set up the spectrometer we also ask the demonstrator to check our setup before proceed because we realise that the spectrometer must be align correctly to achieve accurate and reliable result our hydrogen lamp be position a close to the slit a possible and we do n't move it throughout the experiment we come to the logical conclusion that since we perform the experiment in the same environment throughout the air pressure and humidity would remain fairly constant throughout and would have a negligible effect on our result we also try to limit any background light ensure desk lamp be switch off and the door be close in the dark room we estimate that these factor would be much more noticeable if we be intend to record the rydberg constant to a much high number of significant figure for three significant figure we estimate that these systematic error altogether would contribute about 0.01 to the total error our statistical error be much high than this at the sig fig scale we be measure at and so this can effectively be ignore to conclude the aim of this experiment be to provide some empirical evidence for the current accepted value of the rydberg constant the experimental setup involve an optical spectrometer together with a diffraction grate to display the typical emission spectrum for hydrogen with knowledge of the rydberg formula and balmer series a value for the rydberg constant can be determine for a know wavelength of light we determine the rydberg constant to be 1.10x10 7 with an approximate 2.6 statistical error however we felt that this experiment do take a while to setup a the optical spectrometer have to be align correctly to produce accurate and reliable result once the spectrometer be align it be relatively easy to record measurement unfortunately we struggle to see any other colour aside from blue and red such a violet and if we could see them the intensity be very low perhaps a spectrometer with a high resolution would enable u to see these other colour more clearly we understand from our research that the rydberg formula can be apply to heavier element and a such perhaps this experiment could be extend to other element aside from hydrogen result in a more complicate emission spectrum\"\n"," \"measurement of angle of multiple colour wavelength and order of emission line of hydrogen from the balmer series be take use a grate spectrometer this data be put into a straight line plot which allow the calculation of wavelength which meant a determination of rydberg 's constant r ∞ be calculate and compare to the accepted value through two set of separate data we arrive at two mean value of r ∞ the best value be 10552000±250400 m −1 which carry an uncertainty of 2.4 and an error on the real value of r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 of 3.9 the rydberg equation be a general form of the balmer equation found in 1885 by johann balmer through trial and error and link the wavelength of emission line in the visible hydrogen spectrum and the electron energy level change that produce them 1 the formula give by balmer be a special case for the light emit by hydrogen that fall in the visible spectrum when atom become excite their electron can undergo transition between discrete energy level these energy change result in the emission of discrete energy packet photon which have wavelength correspond to the change in energy the range of possible change of energy level in an atom produce an analogous range of wavelength of photon call a characteristic emission spectrum these spectrum can be use to identify element through spectroscopy however in this experiment a know element will be use hydrogen and the position of it emission line measure in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to take measurement of angular position of spectral line on an arcminute resolution which be a very high resolution and good for make calculation to many significant figure because of the nature of a diffraction grate multiple 'orders or repeat of each colour of emission line can be observe use the spectrometer relationship between wavelength and angular position give in 2 we can plot a straight line graph from which the wavelength of each emission line can be calculate each different wavelength allows a separate calculation of r ∞ and compare our result to the real value allows a benchmark of our experimental technique to be make against high-level experimental determination a grate of 80 l.p.m be use instead for our first set of data take on january 23 2018 but then a second set of data be take january 30 2018 with a 300 l.p.m for comparison a hydrogen lamp be use a our source for our data a it give three well-defined visible spectral line but a sodium lamp be use in the setup of the apparatus a sodium lamp can be left on for longer without overheat the rydberg empirical equation be where n be the initial energy level of an electron in the atom n ∈ n and p be the final energy state p ∈ n p n. in the case of the balmer series p 2. this equation be relevant to this experiment a it describes the visible wavelength produce by hydrogen the balmer series be simply the result of the transition of electron from the n th state to the 2 nd low state in a diffraction grate light diffracts through microscopic slit of which there be of the order of 10 or 100 in a millimetre this cause the diffract light wave to interfere with each other and create light and dark fringe this allows the light that be generate by our source to be amplify into bright peak and mean that each wavelength be repeat in several fringe or 'orders figure 1 indicates figure 1 the path of monochromatic light wave diffract through a grate source 2 the path difference of wave that be travel through separate slit the line ac the condition that these wave must fulfill in order to constructively interfere and make a bright fringe be that they must be in phase at the point of observation this mean that the path difference must be some integer multiple of wavelength which lead to the equation where m be order such that m ∈ n and d be line space in metre this show that a graph of sin θ against m should be a straight line of gradient λ d a d be a constant calculate from where α be the number of line per millimetre in the diffraction grate α ∈ 78.8 300 α 78.8 be for the 80 l.p.m diffraction grate 2 we can calculate λ from this value of λ can be use in balmer 's equation subsituting the know value for n and p for each colour give in table 1 r ∞ can be calculate use the equation 5 which will allow u to make a comparison to the accepted value and hence comment on the accuracy of the experiment the spectrometer be calibrate carefully in order to obtain sharp spectral line across the order in the plane of the eyepiece to make measurement a accurate a possible figure 2 and 3 show clearly the adjustment mechanism that be use to calibrate the spectrometer when look through the eyepiece the observer see a crosshair over the image which be use to make fine visual alignment a show in figure 4. the eyepiece be focus onto the crosshair so it be sharp the telescope lens be then focus by position it near a window and adjust the objective lens until very distant object distance 10m become resolve this be to focus the camera on a point at infinty or close to so that parallax in the eyepiece be minimise without a diffraction grate in place the sodium light source be position in front of the slit and the telescope be move until the crosshair overlap the single emission line from the collimator indicate that the telescope and collimator be parallel it be at this point necessary to adjust the slit so that the line be a narrow a possible whilst still visible to make the position accurate when adjust the telescope position large movement be make by unscrew the fasten screw a label in figure 2 when the telescope be in approx-imately the right place the screw be fasten again and the fine adjustment screw be use to align the crosshair perfectly at this parallel position the reading on the vernier scale be take the angular vernier scale do not provide an absolute angle from a reference point but be instead use for relative measurement this measure value from the vernier scale become our 0 • reference point this reference point be use to rotate the telescope in the horizontal plane 90 • relative to the reference point and hence the collimator a mirror be then insert into the grate holder and the grate table be rotate without affect the vernier scale measurement such that a reflection of the light from the collimator be visible and align with the crosshair base on the principle of reflect light angle of incidence be equal to the angle of reflection this told u that the grate be orient at 45 • to both the collimator and the telescope and the table could then be rotate exactly 45 • use the vernier scale it be then geometrically sound to reason that the grate be in the plane perpendicular to the collimator within a tolerance dictate by the uncertainty on the vernier scale reading which be discus in 6. with the grate stand perpendicular to the collimator the grate table be lock in place to avoid the need for recalibration the mirror be then replace with the grate of choice 80 l.p.m then 300 l.p.m and the table adjustment screw be use to adjust the height and plane orientation of the table until the spectral line from the diffraction grate be in the plane of the telescope across a wide range of angle if the table be not align properly then measurement at high order would be make more difficult and less accurate a they would be in a plane not parallel to the horizontal this be show in figure 5. figure 5 a skew line which would be typical if the table be not correctly adjust this would be more visible at high order it be clear to see that it be not possible to easily define where a measurement should be take in this instance this setup process be follow closely from the lab manual 6 during the first attempt at the setup process the table alignment step be not follow properly a 300 l.p.m grate be be use a it be advise that this would yield clear order for each colour which would reduce confusion however before a full set of data could be take two thing be apparent primarily that the intensity of the spectral line be diminshing very quickly a order increase and so few data point could be take for each colour secondly that the spectral line be deviate from the horizontal this orientation problem be correct and then the grate switch in order to take more data point the main calculation of uncertainty do on the data come from the calculation of uncertainty on the gradient of our graph which be do computationally from the standard deviation of the data point around the regression line in python 's scipy package more data point make the value of deviation more reliable hence why the 80 l.p.m grate be eventually chosen the downside of this be that the order be not a well define -lines of very different order could be found very close to one another this be easily manage by keep good track of the order of each line a the measurement be be take for the 80 l.p.m grate a set of data be take by rotate the telescope through anticlockwise from the 0 • position a this reduce the reading on the vernier scale the absolute angle be negative which meant that the value of order that data be be take for be also negative a the telescope be move through the position and colour of each spectral line observe be record alongside it order this be do until the spectral line diminish to a point where accurate determination of position or order be no longer possible from this position the telescope be swept through again take a set of repeat measurement on the way back to 0 • for the sake of time measurement be not take for order ≥ 1. the raw measurement of angle be record and from them our sero position value be subtract to obtain a correct absolute value of angular position our zero position value be 220 • 10 or 220.17 • 2d.p the 300 l.p.m grate be use to generate a second set of data after the first experiment be perform this be to compare the value of r ∞ for each grate in order to combat the rapid diminish of order that be face with the grate measurement of order both less than and great than 0 be take whereas only order 0 be take with the 80 l.p.m grate repeat be also take for each value measure use the 300 l.p.m this meant there be enough data point to compute error calculation with however there be still distinctly few data point for each colour a discus in 3 each measurement carry an estimate ±3 or 0.05 • uncertainty a discus in 2 the graph of sin θ against order m yield a gradient of λ d therefore for each grate a linear plot be generate for each colour this allow an analysis of the gradient to be perform and λ calculate which in turn allow r ∞ to be calculate for each wavelength use equation 5. in analysis the graph plot for the measurement of angle and order take show a strong linear trend a expect however by inspection it be clear that the result already be not perfect table 2 7 show the wavelength of the line that we see in the hydrogen emission spectrum colour wavelength nm red 656 blue 434 purple 410 it be therefore clear that red should have a steeper line than the other two a gradient ∝ λ. however figure 6 show red be almost parallel to the line for purple the value of λ obtain from the gradient in figure 6 use equation 4 with d 1.27 × 10 −5 from equation 3 be thus present in the table below colour wavelength nm purple 600 ± 57 blue 485.9 ± 1.5 red 830 ± 151 these value be far from accurate and in the case of red and purple they be not precise either the value of wavelength for red be outside the visible range and the value for purple be close to the know value of red wavelength where it should be much low which indicates that there have be some error in the take of data when the measurement be be take the blue spectral line be the easy to see clearly and many more order be visible this be most likely why the value of position for blue be the best because the deviation around blue be the small it error have be quote to 2 d.p a there be great reason to say that it value be know to a high place of accuracy these value and their associate uncertainty be then use in equation 5 to calculate their respective value of rydberg 's constant these be give below colour r ∞ /m −1 purple 7490000 ± 710000 blue 9800000 ± 30250 red 8700000 ± 1580000 these value give a mean value of r ∞ 8660000±1730000 m −1 the discussion of uncertainty for both wavelength and r ∞ be give in 6. use the data from the 300 l.p.m grate another graph be plot similar to before see in figure 7. figure 7 figure 7 the graph for the 300 l.p.m grate show a much more intuitive set of data with the exception of the value of purple at order -3 which fall below the line but carry a large error and so do not influence the line heavily the line all show strong linearity it be also immediately clear that the purple and blue line be close in gradient and that red be much steeper a we expect previously but be not confirm by figure 6. the value of wavelength for this set of data be give in the below table colour wavelength nm purple 434 ± 3 blue 459 ± 10 red 659 ± 5 this show a remark improvement in the likeness of the data to the expect value for wavelength the uncertainty be also more consistent although interestingly blue carry a large uncertainty than the others contrary to the previous set of data these value of wavelength lead to the follow value of rydberg 's constant the uncertainty related to measurement on the vernier scale be subject to estimation a one issue with the precision of the experiement be that it be difficult to say to which arcminute the scale be reading to often multiple line would look close to be align which make the reading hard to give to a fine accuracy an estimate uncertainty of ±3 will be use for angle measurement where denotes arcminute or 1 60 th of a degree a this cover the number of line either side of a give reading that could have also be read a align or close to align this uncertainty of ±0.05 • be include in the calculation of the errorbars on the graph these errorbars be calculate use interpolation of the sine function for each order the error on sin θ σ be calculate use where θ be the mean value of θ take from the two repeat of each point σ θ be the standard deviation on θ calculate use the standard deviation formula on the two datapoints for each order and σ v ernier be the measurement uncertainty from the vernier scale reading σ v ernier 0.05 • all the value be transform to radian before the sine function be use in 6 and 7 a represent the minimum possible estimation of θ i.e the low bound and b represent the upper bound by find half the difference between the sine of a and b we be interpolate linearly in the boundary between the upper and low bound of angle although sine be not a linear function this be still a good estimate a the range between bound for each angle be very small and so the function can be approximate a a linear segment in this interval with negligible error this be prove by the fact that the errorbars on the graph be very small in most case invisible even though the scipy.errorbar function be use to plot them a the errorbars be so small yet the variation of the point around the line be so large it would be irresponsible to say that they be the best estimation of error for λ. a far well estimation of error be the measure of spread around the regression line this be calculate use scipy.polyfit which generates fit parameter for the regression line and also return a covariance matrix c. each point on the line be give a weight w such that w 1 σ which mean the uncertainty from the vernier measurement and the deviation of the repeat value be propogated appropriately the small the error the great the line lean toward that point the uncertainty on the gradient be found use which be the most comprehensive measurement of error on gradient and therefore λ. λ be calculate from the gradient use equation 6. it be reasonable to assume that there be no significant error on d due to manufacturing to estimate the uncertainty on our value of rydberg 's constant the general formula for uncertainty of any function z x a give by which in the case of equation 5gives the mean value of r ∞ calculcated in 5.1 and 5.2 be calculate use the arithmetic mean and the uncertainty value found from add all the other uncertainty in quadrature the mean value of r ∞ 8660000±1730000 m −1 and 10552000± 250400 m −1 both compare differently to the know value of r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 2 the first value have an error of 22 and an uncertainty of 20 both of which be large and indicate that the experimental technique use be flaw it be most likely that the setup be perform incorrectly which lead to a systematic error in the reading of the angle there could also have be an exaggerated effect of random error from reading the vernier scale due to inexperience with reading that type of scale the second value from the 300 l.p.m grate be notably the well value it carry a 3.9 error on the real value which be far more accurate to the level expect of the apparatus use the uncertainty on the value itself be 2.4 which be again a reasonable level of precision that one would expect from the use of a spectrometer which be inherently a precise piece of equipment the majority of this error would have be random and originates from the vernier scale reading a before but there be clearly less systematic error affect this repeat data from the set of data for the 300 l.p.m grate the value for r ∞ calculate from the red wavelength be the most accurate value and carry less uncertainty than the mean a it be the value correspond to the blue wavelength that be responsible for most uncertainty on the mean value from this value of r ∞ 10926000 ± 84200 m −1 the error on the know value be only 0.4 and the uncertainty be 0.8 and so unlike the two mean value the real value of rydberg 's constant fall within the uncertainty of this value this be extremely accurate and although the measurement equipment use have the potential to be very accurate it be debateable whether this value be representative of the experiment give that it be the only value that be this accurate and precise in conclusion the final value of rydberg 's constant from this experiment shall be quote a the mean value r ∞ 10552000 ± 250400 m −1 a it take into account the majority of datapoints take and give a good level of error and uncertainty and be clearly less systematically erroneous than the mean value for the 80 l.p.m data\"\n"," \"this project investigates the measurement of wavelength in the hydrogen spectrum use a grate spectrometer in order to ultimately deduce a value for the rydberg constant wavelength be measure for blue aqua and red emission line which be calculate to be 434.8 ± 2.4 nm 486.9 ± 1.3 nm and 659.6 ± 2.2 nm respectively with their true value be 434nm 486nm and 656nm 1 the rydberg constant be then deduce to be 10940685.2 ± 12293.4 m −1 which be accurate with a 0.3 error compare to the theoretical value of 10973731.6 m −1 2 spectrometer be use to examine the spectrum of light such that wavelength of light over the range of continuous absorption or emission line spectrum can be calculate with emission line spectrum emit by hot gas spectroscopy can be use to measure the width of the spectral line in order to determine property of the emit gas spectrometer be incredibly accurate device that can be use to study flame star plasma and semiconductor 2 for example in astronomy they can be use to measure the age rotational velocity and recessional velocity of interstellar object 3 the aim of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant use this spectroscopy technique involve a grate spectrometer on the emission line spectrum produce by hydrogen gas this be a physical constant that appear in the balmer formula for the spectral line of a hydrogen atom in order to do this the wavelength of the emission line be calculate by measure their diffraction angle after passing through the grate spectrometer emission line spectrum occur when hot gas emit spectrum and be present a a few define line of different colour which correspond to the specific wavelength of light emit by the gas these spectral line be unique to each element so can be use to identify them 1 for example the emission line spectrum for hydrogen can be show in fig 1. when an electron in an atom receives energy for example from heat the electron move to a high energy level cause the atom to be in an excite state however this state be unstable a atom be most stable in their ground state so the electron return to a low energy level by release it excess energy a a photon in the case of a hydrogen atom fig 1. the emission line spectrum produce by hydrogen gas show the four specific wavelength emit on the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum violet blue aqua and red this be what should be view during the experiment through the spectrometer the violet line be weak so sometimes can not be see image adapt from 1 there be multiple energy state that electron transition can occur between quantum mechanic suggests that these energy level exist discretely therefore the emit photon have discrete energy and specific wavelength such that where e be the energy of the photon h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light in a vacuum and λ be the wavelength of the photon this mean the presence of spectral line can be explain by quantum mechanic 4 fig 2. possible electron transition show how they relate to the balmer and lyman series for any atom the high energy level that the electron transition from can be from any number up to infinity but it be the energy level that the electron transition to that determines the series 5 the great the energy difference between the two transition state the shorter the wavelength of the emit photon a it have more energy if the energy difference be great enough the wavelength may be too short to be in the visible spectrum so would not be detect by the spectroscope a it lie in the ultraviolet range likewise if the energy difference be very small the wavelength may be too long to be in the visible spectrum so also would not be detect by the spectroscope a it lie in the infrared range the possible energy transition for hydrogen atom that emit photon in the visible range be from high level to the second orbital energy level this transition to the second energy level be know a the balmer series this idea of energy level and electron transition can be show in fig 2. the balmer series be where electron transition to n 2 from n ≥ 3 where n be the principal quantum number or energy level of the electron 4 in hydrogen both visible light transition and ultraviolet transition form the balmer series with ultraviolet transition also form the lyman series infrared transition form the paschen and pfund series the lyman paschen and pfund series have transition from high energy level to the first third and fourth energy level respectively 6 there be four wavelength displayed in the visible light spectrum for hydrogen 410nm 434nm 486nm and 656nm which correspond to the colour violet blue aqua and red respectively 1 the other balmer line with wavelength shorter than 400nm be in the ultraviolet spectrum and be not visible therefore in order for spectral line to appear on the visible light spectrum the electron transition must emit a photon of the correct wavelength the high energy level which the electron can transition from in order to do this have the quantum number n 6. the spectrometer can be use to view these spectral line by use a lens to produce a collimate beam of light which it disperses with a grate this disperse spectrum be then focus and view with an eyepiece the component that make up the spectrometer can be show in fig 3. fig 3. schematic diagram of the spectrometer and the three main component that make it up the collimator diffraction grate and the telescope the telescope can be consider a the camera and eyepiece this show the path that light take from the source through the device to the eyepiece where the spectral line can be view 2 light from the source travel through a narrow slit where it enters the spectrometer a collimate lens in the spectrometer make the beam parallel therefore all the light ray hit the diffraction grate at the same angle of incidence where this diffract light be then focus onto a cross-hair x by a camera lens an eyepiece be use to view a magnify image of the disperse spectrum 2 the grate consists of many equally space narrow slit with the slit separation be d. the light with wavelength λ diffracts through these slit and the diffract beam interfere with each other the diffraction effect be optimal with maximum wavefront curvature when the grate space have a similar magnitude to the wavelength of the incoming ray a maximum occurs when diffract ray interfere constructively so phase difference between neighbour ray be an integer multiple n of 2π where path difference be dsinθ with θ be the diffraction angle therefore where n represent a positive or negative order number this path difference be displayed in fig 4. the wave be out of phase so interfere destructively to form point of minimum when the path difference be nλ 2 the wave be in phase so interfere constructively to form point of maximum in both case n be an even integer transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by where n be an integer represent the energy level of the initial state of the atom and p be an integer represent the energy level of the final state of the atom here due to the balmer series in hydrogen for the visible spectrum p 2 and n 3,4,5 ... a the electron drop down from a high energy level to the second energy level 2 the rydberg constant be r ∞ which have a theoretical value of 10973731.6 m −1 and can be described in term of fundamental constant where c be the speed of light m e be the mass of an electron h be planck 's constant and α be the fine constant which can be define a where 0 be the permittivity of free space firstly we have to set up the spectrometer to ensure that it be properly align and focus in this way it could be use to make accurate measurement competent of precision of under three part in ten thousand the focus ensure that there be no parallax between the image and cross wire and the telescope need to be align with the axis of the collimator the eyepiece be focus onto the cross wire so that the image be at a convenient view distance without eye strain the camera lens be then focus by view a distant object roughly 5-10 metre away through the lens and focus this object onto the cross wire we place the sodium lamp in front of the slit to illuminate it turn the light off in the room to make this more effective a sodium lamp be use a the light source for set up the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp use later for take measurement would overheat if left on for too long we adjust the collimator 's focus without modify the camera focus until the image of the slit be sharply focus onto the cross wire the clamp screw and slow-motion drive be then adjust in order to align the camera and cross wire so that the cross wire be set on the slit image the slowmotion drive allow the camera to be rotate smoothly and by precise amount we rotate the cross wire a we found that they be most easily use when marked a an x instead of a '+ we move the telescope through exactly 90 degree use the rotation drive and clamped it in position there be two scale use in order to do this precisely the main scale divide into half of a degree and the vernier scale divide into arc minute a mirror be place in the grate holder and the grate table rotate until we could see the reflect image of the slit in the eyepiece once this occur we knew that the mirror be at 45 degree to the incident beam from the collimator we use the adjustment screw under the grate table to modify the height of the image and the grate drive to set the mirror so that the slit image be precisely at the cross wire use the reading that the telescope be set at when it be 90 degree we then rotate the mirror through exactly 45 degree so that it be accurately set at 0 degree incidence to the normal we then move the telescope back 90 degree so that it be at 0 degree orientation the spectrometer be now focus and align so measurement could be take 2 the mirror be replace with a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm and the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen gas lamp through the eyepiece the emission line spectrum of hydrogen could be view a we rotate the telescope use the slow-motion drive for each transition wavelength we measure the diffraction angle θ a a function of order m for positive and negative m value from the zeroth order the reading on the scale be note at the zeroth order a the reference value which be deduct from each transition wavelength reading to get θ. reading be record in degree and then arcminute use both the scale for some wavelength we found that we could obtain more order than for others a others grow dimmer faster for example blue we manage to obtain θ and m value for blue aqua and red line but not purple line for each colour wavelength record a graph of sinθ against m could be plot from equation 3 the gradient of this graph be λ d so the wavelength of each colour spectral line could be calculate from multiply the gradient by the grate space use equation 4we calculate the rydberg constant for each wavelength then could use these to obtain an average value for the constant the result for the variation of sinθ against order m for blue spectral line be present in fig 5. the error bar be barely visible a they be so small that they may be consider negligible this be due to the precision of the spectrometer the gradient of the slope be 3.43 ± 0.0192 x 10 −2 the diffraction angle θ be a function of the reference value and the record angle both of which have an error of half an arc minute a this be half an increment on the vernier scale therefore this error be add twice in quadrature to calculate the error in θ which be propagate through use function error to calculate the error in sinθ use equation 3 the gradient multiply by the grate space be equal to λ which can be calculate to be 434.8 ± 2.4 nm have a 0.56 uncertainty the theoretical value of the wavelength for blue spectral line here be 434nm which lie within the uncertainty therefore there be only a 0.18 error in our result show that it be extremely accurate with the wavelength calculate equation 3 can be use to calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ use the balmer series n 5 for blue wavelength r ∞ be 10953123.1 ± 61473.1 m −1 this be an uncertainty of 0.56 and an error of 0.19 from the theoretical value of 10973731.6 m −1 therefore our result here be very accurate also because the theoretical value lie within the uncertainty of our calculate result the result for the variation of sinθ against order m for aqua spectral line be present in fig 6. the gradient of the slope be 3.84 ± 0.0104 x 10 −2 use this the wavelength for aqua be calculate to be 486.9 ± 1.3 nm a 0.27 uncertainty error be calculate in the same way a described for the blue wavelength this compare to the theoretical value of λ be 486nm so our result have an error of 0.19 and be thus very accurate from the balmer series n 4 for aqua wavelength so r ∞ can be calculate from this data to be 10952833.7 ± 29572.5 m −1 this be an uncertainty of 0.27 and have an error of 0.19 compare to the theoretical value this result be also very accurate due to the small percentage error and because the theoretical value lie within the uncertainty of the r ∞ we calculate in the same way a the previous two colour the wavelength for red could be calculate from the plot of sinθ against order m which be present in fig 7. the gradient of the slope be 5.2 ± 0.017 x 10 −2 this lead to the calculate wavelength to be 659.6 ± 2.2 nm which be a 0.33 uncertainty the theoretical value of λ be 656nm therefore our result have a 0.55 error which be slightly large than the error calculate in the other wavelength but be still very small thus our result be accurate use n=3 from the balmer series for red wavelength r ∞ can be calculate to be 10916098.9 ± 35895.6 m −1 this have a 0.33 uncertainty and have a 0.53 error so this result be very accurate despite have a large error than the previous value calculate for r ∞ to deduce an overall value for r ∞ for this experiment the mean of the three r ∞ value calculate for the individual wavelength on the emission line spectrum for hydrogen be take this prove to be 10940685.2 ± 12293.4 m −1 with the error calculate use standard error of the three r ∞ value this result have a 0.09 uncertainty and a 0.3 error from the theoretical value both of which be very small thus fig 7. the result for sinθ plot against the order m for the red spectral line observe with the spectrometer with precise value and a strong positive correlation there be again negligible error bar however the error in this gradient be large than the error in the gradient of fig 5 and fig 6. prove the accuracy of this result and that systematic error be unlikely the main error take into account although very small be the human error in take reading from the scale we take this to be half an increment on the vernier scale -0.5 arc minute this be because the room be dark and the scale be very small to read so we have to use a magnify glass this error be propagate throughout equation 3 and 4 and then combine with the standard error of multiple data set to calculate the overall error in r ∞ a show in table 1 the r ∞ value calculate for each different colour photon be always slightly below the theoretical value despite all still be very accurate this may have be cause by a small systematic error there be several possible cause of this systematic error a we have to consider the effect of spectrometer misalignment defocus lamp position grate period air pressure and humidity and background light defocus seem unlikely because the emission line be very sharp and in focus the most likely cause of this systematic error be probably a slight misalignment in the spectrometer this may have explain why all the wavelength value calculate for each spectral line be slightly large than their theoretical value and thus the rydberg constant be always small furthermore θ value should have be the same for positive and negative order of the same magnitude however some be out by 0.5 which highlight how there be a small spectrometer misalignment the spectral resolution of the diffraction grate be limited to the grate period d. to obtain a high spectral resolution grate should be of a very large size or there should be a high number density of slit however this be difficult due to the high-precision process of the spectrometer 7 the grate period calculate from the number of line per mm give on the grate slide may not have be the exact value of the period but in fact slightly large which would explain the slightly large wavelength calculate other factor to consider be air pressure and humidity the theoretical wavelength value give be for those photon travel through a vacuum however the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in air be small to that in a vacuum this be primarily due to the atmosphere have a refractive index that affect the curvature of the electromagnetic path 8 this refractivity of air be dependent on pressure temperature and humidity a they all affect the density of air in a vacuum pressure be far low than the atmospheric pressure experienced in the room there be also matter in the air but not in a vacuum which affect the path of the diffract wave therefore take measurement for pressure temperature and humidity and use formula the density of the room can be calculate in order to calculate the refractive index n of air in the room this can be use to convert the value obtain for wavelength into the wavelength in a vacuum a λ vac nλ air 9 these new value could then be use to calculate r ∞ on the other hand the experiment can be conduct in a vacuum chamber to make the wavelength value more accurate to the theoretical vacuum value background light may have make it harder to view certain order a although external light do n't affect the position of spectral line it affect their relative intensity to the background view through the spectrometer this may have affected how for each colour photon we always found more negative order than positive order a positive and negative order be suppose to be symmetrical about the zeroth order in the same way our lamp position may have obstruct the view of some emission line so some be too faint to be see therefore to improve we could have turn all lamp off before take reading a we may have see more emission line at full intensity and we perhaps could have obtain more data point lead to an even more accurate gradient we may also have see the fourth violet emission line a this be include in the visible range for hydrogen emission line this would increase precision of result and the accuracy of the calculate rydberg constant the aim of the experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ by use a grate spectrometer to calculate the transition wavelength produce in the visible range of the emission line spectrum for hydrogen gas our result for the wavelength r ∞ be very accurate and close to the true value with r ∞ calculate to be 10940685.2 ± 12293.4 m −1 only have a 0.3 error the spectrometer be use effectively to give precise measurement for value of the diffraction angle θ against order m and we be able to obtain value of θ for order of high magnitude up to 12 for aqua emission line the main error account for be the human error in take reading from the vernier scale on the spectrometer however small systematic error be consider in the data analysis a although our result be incredibly accurate they be n't perfect and be all out by a similar amount to improve the experiment perhaps multiple reading could have be take with the experiment repeat and the mean reading record to reduce uncertainty and human error possible systematic error could be take into account such a consider the effect of the atmosphere 's refractive index on the wavelength of the photon and thus conduct the experiment in a vacuum chamber measurement could have be take in order to make estimation for possible systematic error or to determine them which could then be include in the calculation of error also all background light should be eliminate in order to view the spectral line easily a perhaps more could have be observe\"\n"," \"the aim of the experiment be to measure the spectrum of vaporise hydrogen from a hydrogen lamp and determine the wavelength of the spectral line use this we calculate the rydberg constant for each spectral line and found an average and take the standard error the final value of the rydberg constant we obtain be 1.092x10 7 ± 3.180x10 4 m -1 this be a highly precise experiment generate a percentage error of only 0.291 the set up consists of a simple spectrometer with a 78.8 lines/mm diffraction grate and a hydrogen lamp the spectrometer can measure in the vernier scale the small increment of measurement be 1 arcminute we measure the angle at which each order of the spectral line appear after be diffract and plot a sin angle against order graph to determine the wavelength of the spectral line the wavelength be then use with rydberg formula to determine the constant spectrometry be a technique of use em radiation and in specific case also use the mass of an ion and magnetic field to determine the structure or the composition of a material or an object diffract light from a material or the amount of ion deflection in a magnetic field be analyse 1 in our experiment we be focus on the emission spectrum of hydrogen gas a a potential difference v across the filament in the hydrogen lamp be apply the gas be heat and cause the atom to be excite the electron in the atom be promote to a high energy level and then fall to a low energy level energy equivalent to the difference in the energy level be release in the form of a photon 2 the energy level be fix and so only photon with discrete wavelength be release therefore each element or compound have a unique spectral pattern in this experiment we be observe the balmer series in hydrogen this be to say we be look at wavelength of photon generate from an electron transition from a high level n=3,4,5… to energy level p=2 this produce photon in the visible spectrum this can be see in the rydberg formula give by eq 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 𝑛 be the energy level high than 2 and 𝑝 be the 2 nd energy level 3 the light in the spectrometer can diffract through a diffraction grate the wavelength of each spectral line can be determine by the diffraction formula give by eq 2 where ⅆ be the distance between the slit in the diffraction grate 𝜃 be the angle at which the order appear in radian 𝑚 be the order at which the spectral line appear where m 0 ±1 ±2 etc and 𝜆 be the wavelength pf the spectral line 4 the central order m =0 will appear at 𝜃 =0 at the central order all the spectral line will be overlap the set up consists of a simple spectrometer with a 78.8 lines/mm diffraction grate and a sodium or hydrogen lamp the set up can be see in fig 1. sodium lamp be use to ready the spectrometer a it produce high intensity light and have a longer operational time than the hydrogen lamp however the sodium lamp do take some time about 2 minute to reach maximum intensity it have a manageable warm up time this overall make the set up of the spectrometer much easy a time can be take to make fine adjustment the disadvantage of use a hydrogen lamp instead of shin light through a vial of vaporise hydrogen and measure an absorption spectrum be that lamp only remains bright enough to make measurement of the low wavelength light for about 10 minute it also only have an operational time of 20 minute this meant that the measurement have to make quickly this however be still more manageable than the alternate method of produce the hydrogen spectrum a the light emit through the hydrogen may have it own spectrum this may lead to confusion when analyse the overall spectrum the sodium lamp be set up in front of the slit and the slit be narrow the intensity of light from the sodium lamp be high and the narrow slit provide a high resolution of the spectral line the resolution be the ability to separate two spectral line and see them discretely the spectral line be then focus use the focus nob the spectral line be ensure to be vertical by place a filter that block some light and turn the line into small dot it be important to ensure that the spectral line be vertical so that the angle measure be in a plane that be perpendicular to the line the filter be make by cut a triangle in a black square card it be position in front of the slit and adjust until the line appear to be dot the filter be then taped on to the slit securely hold it in position the head of the spectrometer be rotate from left to right and we observe if the crosshair pas through the centre of the dot if the crosshair do n't then the stand hold the diffraction grate be adjust use the 3 level screw until it do the filter be then remove a diagram of the filter can be see in fig 2 the diffraction grate be also place such that it be perpendicular to the slit and lens array in front of the lamp preliminary data of the order and angle at which the order appear be make use the sodium lamp here we notice that it be best to make measurement by rotate the head in one direction ie go from m= -4 to m=4 rather than start at the m=0 and change direction after reach the high order this be because change direction occasionally cause the spectrometer to shift a it be not fix to the table finally we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be place such that it be closer to the slit and the centre of the lamp face the slit the centre of the lamp be the brightest part of it the slit be also make to be a bit wider than before this allow more light into the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp be dimmer than the sodium lamp this however decrease the resolution of the spectral line the spectrometer be refocus and measurement be make first we slowly move from the 0 th order a this be the easy to identify to the -4 th order which we define to be in the clockwise direction then we measure the angle at which the red spectral line appear make sure to keep the crosshair in the centre of the line this be do by use the fine adjustment screw locate on the base we then measure the angle of the subsequent order of the red line until we reach m +4 we then repeat the same technique with the blue and purple line the observe spectral pattern of hydrogen can be see in fig 3 and the data of the angle of each order for each spectral line can be see in appendix a. a see in fig 3 the pattern also contains a rainbow artefact this be due to light from the surround enter the spectrometer if the experiment be do in perfectly dark condition then this pattern would not be see\"\n"," 'in this experiment we use a grate spectrometer to investigate the hydrogen emission spectrum and obtain an estimate for the rydgerg constant we observe the three expect colour of the spectrum through the grate spectrometer i.e red green and violet however there be also the colour orange which could have be due to impurity present in the hydrogen lamp there be indeed a linear relationship between sinθ and m. we obtain a value of 110 ± 6 𝑥 10 5 𝑚 −1 for the rydberg constant spectrometer be instrument use to study the spectrum of light the spectrum generally take one of two form hot solid such a a tungsten lamp filament emit spectrum where the intensity be a slowly vary function of wavelength-a `` continuous spectrum `` hot or electrically excite gas emit spectrum in which the emission be concentrate at a few well-defined wavelengths-called `` emission line spectrum `` from the appearance of the slit image of the spectrometer spectroscopy be a `` non-invasive `` technique allow physicist to observe natural phenomenon such a plasma star flame semiconductor without risk of exposure to radiation thus it be a very powerful tool available to physicist in it simplest form a spectrometer u a lens or mirror to produce a collimate beam of light and disperses it with a grate or a prism the disperse spectrum be then focus and view with an eyepiece or record with an electronic detector for this experiment we investigate the hydrogen emission spectrum the hydrogen atom contains a single electron orbit the nucleus the electron have many

accepted value 1.097 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 the accepted value be not within the calculate error range for the experiment which be believe to be due to other source of error not account for the rydberg constant be a fundamental constant of physic and be formulate by physicist johannes rydberg in 1890 a part of the rydberg formula the rydberg formula be use to find the wavelength of a photon travel between energy level in an atom this be very significant a it allows for the calculation of the wavelength of an emit photon without know the value for the energy difference between these energy level in the atom in this experiment a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp be use in order to measure the diffraction angle of emission line which be in turn use to find the wavelength of emit photon which could be use with the rydberg formula to calculate a value of the rydberg constant photon will be emit from a gas when it be hot a electron that have become excite to high energy level be prone to spontaneous emission in which the electron fall from a high energy level to a low energy level and emits a photon with energy equal to the difference in energy level when the difference in energy

value of p have it own emission series and in this experiment a value of p=2 be use a it be the balmer series in hydrogen in which the transition wavelength be in the visible part of the spectrum and so can be observe by eye a diffraction grate consist of n equally space slit be use to separate different wavelength of light and repeat principle maximum be produce due to constructive interference of the diffract light the follow equation hold for principal maximum of light through a diffraction grate where n be an integer now use we obtain measurement of the rydberg constant use the grate spectrometer where d be the slit separation which can be use to calculate the wavelength of the emit photon if the wavelength initial and final state be know then equation 1 can be use to calculate the rydberg constant the grate spectrometer that be use for the data collection first require to be calibrate precisely this be do by first focus the eyepiece on the crosshair and then to focus the camera lens on an object approximately 5-10 metre away next the crosshair be to be align with the image of the slit and the focus of the collimator adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the crosshair the angle which the telescope be currently at be the initial angle and all record will be from this the telescope be then rotate 90 degree clamped into position and a grate be put in the holder next the grate table be move until a reflect image of the entrance slit could be slit which meant that the grate surface be at a 45 degree angle to the light from the collimator and the grate drive be use to adjust the slit image until it be at the crosshair the grate table and telescope be then move back 45 and 90 degree respectively to their original position so that the grate be now perpendicular to the light and the telescope be parallel to the collimator axis data be collect for 3 different wavelength correspond to the colour red blue and violet with initial state n=3,4,5 respectively the angle of each successive maximum on either side of the central maximum be measure use the vernier scale in the grate spectrometer for m=-3 -2 -1,0,1,2,3 for red emission line and m=-2

majority of data point within their respective uncertainty for the red light the gradient of the line be calculate to be 0.053 and the covariance matrix in 5 be obtain begin to overheat also result in dimmer line and high error the aim of this experiment be to use the grate spectrometer to find value of the wavelength of blue red and violet light which in turn could be use in the rydberg formula to

7 m −1 which be slightly low than the true value and there be a 3.64 difference between 𝑅 ∞avg and the accepted value it be likely that the reason for this be due to unaccounted error such a one described above and also the failure to set up the grate spectrometer adequately which would have lead to a systematic error in the record in addition to this despite the vernier scale be very precise it be often the case that there be a disagreement a to what value the vernier scale be display this be due to it be slightly ambiguous to know which mark be most line up between the vernier scale and the main scale and so incorporate this reading error would improve the credibility of the experimental result'\n"," \"troscopy method with a hydrogen lamp the aim be to determine a value for the

quite agree with the accepted value of 10 973 736.6 m 1 for the rydberg constant this be due to a small systematic error t he grate spectrometer be a device that be construct with a specific pathway for light spectroscopy involves the study of spectrum by take measurement of radiation and this device be just one of many that can be use for this purpose electromagnetic radiation be able to pa

many quantity through the calculation of specific wavelength and constant like that of the rydberg constant this ability to identify relationship mean it have great importance with it application for example the result it be capable of produce allow the determination of gas temperature and density on a small scale and the velocity of galaxy with respect to each other on a large scale 1 exploit these experimental property meant that the rydberg constant could be found by take measurement of the emission spectrum produce by a hydrogen lamp specifically it be the analysis of interference

radiation can be consider to occur in waveform so it be able to undergo this phenomenon in the case of the grate spectrometer there be a diffraction grate which act a multiple aperture a the light wave pas through the aperture diffraction will occur and this will be more observable when the width of the aperture be similar to that of the light wavelength the grate consists of many narrow slit which have the same width and be separate equally each slit cause diffraction to occur and therefore interference can also happen this be because the light wave from each slit will cross path and superimpose path difference be the respective difference in distance travel by wave after exit the slit it be illustrate in fig 1 and through the use of trigonometry the path difference be give by where be the path difference d be the slit separation and ✓ be the diffraction angle the superposition result in an interference pattern form because the wave be able to interfere with each other

the phase difference and m be the order number the wavenumber which be write a k be characteristic to a wave and be consider a the phase per unit distance a demonstrate by this equation where be the wavelength the fractional distance of the wavelength move in other word the phase difference relates to the path difference by the follow equation equate the result in equation 1 equation 2 and equation 4gives the follow relationship between the separation of slit and the wavelength b. energy level in quantum theory atom consist of neutron and proton in their central nucleus with electron in surround orbital shell quantum theory explains the characteristic behaviour of the electron because of the quantum mechanical system they can be consider to act in the atom be clearly stable because it can retain it initial state in most case provide that it be not radioactive the explanation for the model of the atom by classical mechanic be unstable because it allows the electron to have any energy whereas in quantum mechanic the electron can only have specific discrete value of energy the electron be a negatively charge particle and will experience an attractive force due to it interaction with the positively charge nucleus a coulomb 's law state the presence of a resultant force by newton 's second law mean it be also accelerate accord to the larmor formula 3 the electron will radiate power because it be both charge and accelerate this radiation represent an energy loss and in the classical model this electron would spiral into the nucleus a represent in fig 2 meaning that the whole atom itself appear to be unstable fig 2. the classical model to the left show an electron that loses energy collapse towards the nucleus this electron be particle like the quantum model to the right show a stable electron orbit the nucleus with fix energy this electron be wave like 4 the quantum model allows electron to have discrete quantity of energy a way in which this be possible be if the electron be to act a stand wave in each orbit the orbit have a circumference that be a multiple of the electron 's wavelength which mean the orbit can only occur at specific distance from the nucleus the electron can only exist in these discrete orbit therefore they can only transition between these particular position 5 these transition amount to a change in total energy because there be a change in both potential energy and kinetic energy there be two case one where an electron drop an energy level and another where it rise an energy level rise an energy level require a gain in energy this be ultimately because the potential energy be increase and the attraction to the nucleus must be overcome fig 3. the electron move from a discrete high energy level to a discrete low energy level therefore there be a discrete energy loss which occurs a electromagnetic radiation this electromagnetic radiation be present a a photon characterise by a specific wavelength and frequency drop an energy level amount to a decrease in energy and it be this case that be explore in this experiment the decrease in energy be represent by the emission of a photon a fig 3 illustrates the photon emit will have a discrete amount of energy because of the discrete orbitals these packet of energy be quantise by the follow equation where e be the energy of the photon h be planck 's constant and ⌫ be the frequency of the photon this can be rewrite a where c be the speed of light consider this energy be quantise there must be a some kind of relationship between the energy of emit photon and their orbital ring or in other word energy level this energy be a function of wavelength a equation 7 show and so this relationship can be express by the equation where be specifically the wavelength of the emit photon in a vacuum r 1 be the rydberg constant z be the atomic number n be the initial energy level of the electron and p be the final energy level of the electron in the case of hydrogen because it only have one the equation simplifies to the transition between the energy level have many combination so they be divide in to series which be characterise by the final energy level of the electron the balmer series be one that be define for when electron drop down to the second energy level other series such a the lyman and paschen be define by energy level of 1 and 3 respectively 6 the significance of the balmer series be that it be the only series that produce wavelength within the visible light spectrum therefore throughout the analysis of the hydrogen emission spectrum the only line that can be view directly by eye in the laboratory be from the balmer series the transition which give visible light only go up to the point where the electron begin at energy level 6. this be because the change in energy level becomes so large that the wavelength of the emit photon be too small to be observe the human eye can view electromagnetic wave with wavelength between 400 and 700 nm the wavelength emit on the visible spectrum correspond to different colour emission a picture in fig 4. the grate spectrometer be set up on a raise platform by be attach to a small table so that all observation could easily be take at eye level throughout the experiment it be make sure that the optical equipment be not touch so that the equipment be clean and light could travel a expect the camera lens of the telescope be focus onto an object that be around 5 to 10 meter away this be do in a well lit room to make the image easy for view the eyepiece lens be then focus onto the crosshair to reduce parallax between the image and the crosshair itself once this be do the experiment be move into a darken room the telescope be align directly with the axis of the collimator so that they be position in a straight line a sodium lamp be place behind the slit for the rest of the setup in order to protect the hydrogen lamp a prolong use of it could have cause it to overheat and become damage the light from the slit be view through the eyepiece and the focus of the collimator be adjust until slit light be focus on the crosshair the slit size be reduce to the point where it be more manageable to focus it the crosshair be also rotate to a cross position a oppose to a plus position to aid this focus process the main scale and vernier scale be use to record the exact position of the telescope the grate table be rotate through 90 degree with the slow motion drive aid this rotation to be a accurate a possible once it be clamped tightly into position a mirror be place in the holder fig 5. the light from the hydrogen lamp pas through the slit and a reduce segment of it be capture this fraction of light can be diffract by the slit but the ray of light be make parallel when they pa through the collimator these parallel beam be then diffract by the diffraction grate have met it surface perpendicularly these diffract light ray then enter the telescope and be magnify into the eyepiece by passing through the camera lens and eyepiece lens 8 the holder be rotate until a reflect image from the collimator be view from the eyepiece to ensure that the grate surface be at 45 degree to the incident ray the adjustment screw on the grate table be alter so that the table be horizontal and at a height where the image be align with the crosshair the angle of the grate table be record and rotate through by 45 degree use the table and slow motion drive so that it surface be perpendicular to the incident ray the mirror be replace for a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm the telescope be finally then move back through 90 o to it original position so it be in alignment with the slit collimator and grate at this original position the light be observe a be a maximum with a combination of colour that have not be diffract at all this be take to be the reference point for order 0 and it position be record a 183.5 o 5 ± 0.5 the spectral line be observe briefly by rotate the telescope the slit size be alter by decrease and increase it until the line could be view optimally start from the maximum order at 183.5 o 5 the positive direction be take to be clockwise in which the scale of the angle reading increase the order record from here be also take to be positive the telescope be slowly rotate around until the first order be locate the colour present be record position the crosshair on each spectral line meant the angle on the scale could be measure for each colour at order 1. this be repeat across the whole quadrant for the subsequent order until no more line could be observe at all the telescope be then take in the counterclockwise direction from the reference point and the same reading be record such that the angle on the scale be decrease and the order be consider to be negative three colour be observe throughout the experiment these be red aqua and blue which can also be name h-↵ h-and h-respectively in relation to their electron 's initial position for all of these wavelength there be a positive correlation present between the sine of the diffraction angle and the order associate with that angle the diffraction angle be calculate by subtract the reference angle of 183.5 o 5 from the record value on the scale each reading have an error of 0.5 arcminute so the error in the diffraction angle be simply calculate by add the error in quadrature for the subtraction this meant each diffraction angle have an error of 0.71 arcminute with respect to the sine of the angle this error can be consider negligible a show by the very small error in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8. this emphasis the precision the grate spectrometer can have when take measurement the graph be manipulate such that they pas through the origin because this be a specific value for the datasets and can be record a well a state without error because it occurs at the reference angle for this experiment the wavelength and their error be calculate by multiply the gradient and error by the grate period of 12.69 µm the grate period be take to have no error because it be custom make therefore the only error account for in this calculation result from the angle measurement the red wavelength be calculate a 656.1 ± 2.7 nm this be closely align with the accepted value of 656.3nm within experimental uncertainty the aqua wavelength be calculate a 490.8 ± 3.4 nm 486.1 nm be the accepted value and the calculate value do n't agree with this experimentally but this be only a slight difference the blue wavelength be calculate a 439.8 ± 6.0 nm this wavelength coincides with the accepted one of 434.0 nm within the experimental error obtain the position of the lamp be found to have no affect on the position of the line because the slit still accepts a fraction of the light it be found however that the lamp position affected the intensity of the light with a reduction if it be far away therefore if it be n't a close a possible to the slit the line at great order may not have be visible a likely cause for an error in the wavelength be the calibration of the spectrometer the fact that the anticlockwise direction have more observable order suggests the diffraction pattern be n't symmetric about our reference point this mean the calibration of the instrument ca n't have be correct and the light may have hit the grate surface at an angle that be n't the normal this be highlight by the modulus value of the diffraction angle for each order in table i the symmetry appear to get bad a the wavelength decrease fig 6. a linear relationship be show between the sine of the diffraction angle and the order this red photon give the steepest gradient out of the three photon with a value of 0.05170 ± 0.00021 and this corresponds to how the absolute value of the error for the wavelength also increase a wavelength decrease to improve in this case a great grate period could be use a although less order would be present the same number should still be record-able the pattern would also be more symmetric because the angle of each order would be much more similar a far extension of this would have be to check the symmetry before take measurement by verify if it be calibrate correctly the air pressure humidity and temperature affect the record of the wavelength in a systematic way because when the each of these value increase the air in the room becomes less vacuum like the increase in pressure mean the pressure be n't exactly that of a vacuum increase in the number of water molecule in the air mean that the area be n't a deplete of matter so the air be less of a vacuum furthermore by the gay-lussac law the great temperature result in the pressure be great too such that it be less vacuum like 9 all of this mean the refractive index be great than that of a perfect vacuum so the speed of the light be less result in a reduce wavelength in this case the wavelength be n't less but actually slightly great therefore this must n't be a significant contributor to the variation of wavelength to their accepted value a likely systematic error would be that of the grate period it may not be exactly a state but actual more therefore the wavelength be calculate a be great than they should be in addition to this the separation may not be perfectly uniform and so wavelength would of course appear to be slightly different this would require a test of the diffraction grate value use a know wavelength for a monochromatic light by the same method a this experiment the calculate wavelength for each photon emission be related to their respective emission level use the balmer series it be evident that the red photon occur by an electron drop from a low energy level than the others equation 7 show this a it 's clear a large wavelength cause a small energy change therefore it could be conclude that the respective energy level state be 3 for h-↵ 4 for h-fig 8. this linear relationship have the shallowest gradient of the three photon of 0.03466 ± 0.00047 because it have the great energy and therefore the small wavelength and 5 for h- the reciprocal of the wavelength be plot against the change in the reciprocal of the square of the energy level to give a straight line in fig 9. the covariance matrix for this plot could not be calculate because there be only three point however the line clearly illustrates the linear relationship present where the gradient be the negative of the rydberg constant a predict by equation 8. the rydberg constant be calculate by consider each of the three value of the constant from the three wavelength a independent value that can form a normal distribution with a mean and standard error use equation 9. the rydberg value be found to have an average of 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 this meant the rydberg constant calculate can be state a 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 the value deduce for the rydberg constant do not agree with the accepted value of 10 973 731.6 m 1 this be only ever so slightly a the percentage difference be 0.77 this would suggest that the experiment be very accurate a it only differs from the accepted value slightly however within experimental uncertainty it be do n't therefore there be likely to be a small systematic error this error would have occur in the measurement take for the wavelength if the fourth colour be observe the experiment would have be well a the precision would be great because fig 9. there be a linear trend between the change in the reciprocal of the energy level square the slope be define a the negative of the rydberg constant the dash line be that of the actual constant and the solid one be the experimental one so it be evident there be a systematic error because the experimental value be shallower and therefore less than the accepted value the error be less and the linear relationship would have be verify more strongly the fact that there be only four point that be visible be still very little therefore a way in which the experiment can be improve to allow for more data point in the final plot be to record wavelength that be n't visible a method for this would be to use a uv-meter this would allow not only the uv-light in the balmer series to be detect but the uv-light in the lyman series the rydberg constant be deduce a 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 this be a very precise result with a small percentage error of 0.40 it only deviate from the accepted value by 0.77 and this be most likely due to a small systematic error it be show that the grate spectrometer be effective in study the spectrum of light the proportional relationship between the sine of diffraction angle and their order be consistently verify this allow precise and accurate wavelength of h-↵ h-and h-to be calculate a 656.1 ± 2.7 nm 490.8 ± 3.4 nm and 439.8 ± 6.0 nm respectively a clear success for this experiment be the use of the spectrometer because record be take efficiently and precisely with the main and vernier scale despite this successful usage the setup could definitely be improve with well calibration to ensure that the pattern be symmetric about order 0. furthermore extra investigation could be carry out to estimate the magnitude of the potential systematic error an adaptation to the experiment would involve increase the number of wavelength obtain so that the experiment have less spread the use of a uv-meter would enable more line to be record the repetition of the experiment in a glass chamber would ensure the area be a close to a vacuum a possible allow great accuracy for the wavelength value the grate spectrometer be a sufficient device for deduce the rydberg constant and it be effective in produce precise result the combination of many theory like quantum and wave-particle duality result in the rydberg constant meaning it be a vital constant in explain the model of the atom\"\n"," \"in this experiment we attempt to determine the rydberg constant by direct measurement of the wavelength of photon emit from the de-excitation of hydrogen atom in the balmer series use a spectrometer with diffraction grate of line density n 300mm −1 grate 1 and n 78.8mm −1 grate 2 we then use the rydberg equation to make an estimate of the rydberg constant from the gradient and y-intercept of the plot we estimate the rydberg constant within a tolerance of 2.7 or less use grate 1 we calculate r∞ 1.11 ± 0.03 × 10 7 m −1 and r∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and y-intercept respectively for grate 2 we have r∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 and r∞ 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and yintercept respectively s pectrometer device be use to observe the emission or absorption spectrum of a light source or gaseous atom spectrometer typically offer measurement to an accuracy of ±1 or 1 arc-minute 1 when propagate through this be equivalent to an error in the wavelength of approximately σ λ 0.03 give sufficient repeat measurement be make 2 make it one of the most accurate experimental equipment available a spectrometer be usually configure along with a refractive prism or a diffraction grate by use the prism it be possible to analyse the amount of refraction undergone by each incident wavelength of light and therefore determine the refractive index of the prism a a function of wavelength 3 by use a diffraction grate it be possible to use the diffraction angle to determine the wavelength of the incident light in our experiment we will be use the latter technique to analyse the emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp the grate spectrometer have a range of application for example the grate spectrometer be use by fraunhofer in 1814 to see the 574 dark line of the solar absorption spectrum 4 which be subsequently use to determine the atomic composition of the sun similarly the light from distant star have be analyse by highly sensitive grate spectrometer and this have be use to determine their atomic composition which subsequently allows astrophysicist to infer the temperature and age of these star spectrometry can also be use with gas chromatography in forensics to analyse the composition of a sample of material a discus by knight the ratio of the intensity of these spectral line be related to the temperature of the gaseous sample while the width of the line be related to the density of the gas 2 give vital clue for analysis of the sample this technique can be use to confirm the presence of certain atom for example in a drug sample or can be use to verify the purity of water 5 the rydberg constant be fundamental to physic and be related to a number of physical quantity primarily the rydberg constant be the constant of proportionality in the rydberg equation which relates the wavelength of light emit by excite electron when they transition between the energy level of a hydrogen atom the value of the rydberg constant denote r ∞ be approximately 6 r ∞ 1.09737 × 10 7 m −1 however the rydberg constant also have other application for example it can be define in term of the fine structure constant α 7.29735 × 10 −3 which be a dimensionless quantity that characterises the ratio of the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two electron to the strength of the gravitational interaction between two planck mass 7 then the rydberg constant can be express a where a 0 5.29177 × 10 −11 m be the bohr radius the wavelength of light need to ionise a hydrogen atom be λ 9.12 × 10 −8 m and can be calculate by equate eq 1 to 1/λ from the planck-einstein relation the ionisation energy of the hydrogen atom be then e 2.176 × 10 −18 j. the rydberg constant be also related to the compton wavelength of an electron λ e by therefore the compton wavelength of an electron be λ e 2.426 × 10 −12 m. note that the relationship of the rydberg constant to other physical constant provide an indirect method of determine these constant for example if we be able to determine the rydberg constant through a grate spectrometer experiment then we be subsequently able to determine other related quantity such a the fine structure constant the bohr radius or the compton wavelength of an electron which can then be use to determine planck 's constant or the mass of an electron the ability to measure the rydberg constant accurately also limit the error in these related quantity that may be more difficult to measure experimentally spectrometry be the process of analyse the emission spectrum of a light source or the absorption spectrum of a sample material to understand the principle of spectroscopy the bohr model of the atom be use where electron exist only in discrete energy level which be unique to each atom therefore the energy level transition -that be the energy need for an electron to transition from a low energy state to high energy state -are generally unique for each atom when an atom de-excites it electron transition from a high energy state to a low energy state release energy a photon the energy release from each de-excitation event be equal to the energy difference between the initial energy state and the final energy state a these energy difference be discrete and unique for each atom the energy of the photon emit and hence the wavelength of the photon emit be also discrete and unique for each atom when an atom be excite by heating it electron move to high energy level but be unstable in these energy level and will spontaneously de-excite emit photon of discrete wavelength if these emit photon be analyse they will produce an emission spectrum conversely if an atom in it ground state be expose to white light contain photon with energy that coincide with the transition energy of the atom the ground state electron will absorb these photon and transition to the high energy level this will produce absorption spectrum of dark line where certain wavelength of white light be absorbed by the electron of gaseous atom in this experiment we will consider the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom hydrogen have a number of spectral series for example the lyman series be the set of spectral line when excite electron from energy level n 2 3 4 de-excite to the ground state we will focus on the balmer series which refers to the spectral line emission when electron in energy level n 3 4 5 de-excite to the second energy level this be because the balmer series be the only spectral series for hydrogen that result in the emission of line in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum the define equation for this behaviour be the rydberg equation where λ be the wavelength of the photon emit when an electron de-excites from the nth energy level to the pth energy level p n a before r ∞ be the rydberg constant p 2 for the balmer series and n 3 4 5 then the value of λ for different value of n be give in table i. the diffraction grate of the grate spectrometer behaves accord to the principle of diffraction and interference diffraction occurs when a wavefront encounter an obstruction the balmer series -these be the wavelength of photon emit when an electron in a hydrogen atom deexcites from the nth energy level to the second energy level note that n could take any value up to ∞ but these value of n be the only one that produce photon in the visible spectrum which range from 400-700nm 8 in it path such a an aperture or an obstacle 1 this cause the wavefront to curve around the obstruction which creates a path difference between different ray and therefore cause interference produce an intensity pattern that depends on the geometry of the setup when the number of slit be increase the intensity pattern becomes more complicate and be show for n 2 10 slit in fig 1. fig 1 plot show the intensity pattern produce by diffraction through n slit for a fix slit width and slit separation solid line note that each of the intensity pattern be modulate by the intensity pattern of single slit diffraction dash line since each slit have a finite width and therefore light also undergoes single slit diffraction through these slit the equation for the intensity pattern produce by a wave of wavelength λ diffract through a diffraction grate of line density n be 9 in this experiment we aim to use a grate spectrometer to make an estimate of the rydberg constant firstly we will use the grate spectrometer to measure the diffraction angle and hence the wavelength of light emit by a light source contain gaseous hydrogen atom we will compare these wavelength to those suggest by the rydberg equation accord to the balmer series allow u to make an estimate of the rydberg constant we can now use our derive equation to make prediction about the experiment firstly from the rydberg equation eq 2 we predict that we will observe principle maximum correspond to the wavelength and colour specify in table i. it be possible that the maximum correspond to λ 410nm will not be visible a it be almost outside of the visible light spectrum nevertheless we should be able to make measurement of at least three of the wavelength in table i. we can make the measurement of the wavelength λ by record the order m of the maximum observe and the diffraction angle θ at which the maximum occurs use the spectrometer then with sufficient repeat measurement we plot the graph of sin θ against m correspond to the relation give in eq 4. hence the slope of this plot should be and therefore we can determine the wavelength λ. once we have record the wavelength for correspond value of n from table i we then use the relationship in eq 2 to plot a graph of 1/λ against 1/n 2 this plot should have slope give by s −r ∞ 6 and y-intercept since p 2 for the balmer series we can determine the rydberg constant from these relationship we use a grate spectrometer with an engrave vernier scale on a rotate diffraction table the spectrometer include a collimator with a slit which ensures that the incident ray be parallel and an eyepiece which allows the intensity pattern to be observe a the light source we use a hydrogen lamp which excites gaseous hydrogen atom by passing a current through the gas the emit light be a mixture of wavelength but we will only be able to observe the visible photon with wavelength a specify in table i. we also have diffraction grate of slit density n 78.8mm −1 and n 300mm −1 provide to u fig 2 show the set-up of the apparatus a view from above fig 2 a plan view of the apparatus use to measure the wavelength of light emit by de-excitation of hydrogen atom the light emit by a hydrogen lamp be collimate before be diffract through the diffraction grate the rotate eyepiece can then be use to record the order m and the angle θ m of the spectral line first we configure the eyepiece by adjust the focus until it produce a clear pattern of the crosshairs we also rotate the crosshairs until they form an × instead of a this make it easy to find the centre of the spectral line see fig 7 in appendix b to complete the experiment successfully it be crucial that the light from the hydrogen lamp be perpendicular to the diffraction grate to prevent oblique incidence pattern which complicates the analysis 10 to do this we first lock the diffraction table and align the eyepiece parallel to the collimator while ensure no diffraction grate be use a source of light e.g desk lamp be use to illuminate the slit cover the opening of the collimator the slit be then close until the central line be view a a clear vertical line from the eyepiece if the line be not vertical the angle of the slit be adjust until this requirement be met once the crosshairs be centre on the line of light from the desk lamp the eyepiece be fix in position and an initial reading of the angle be take from the vernier scale on the diffraction table from this reading we subtract 90 • and then rotate the eyepiece to the calculate angle this ensures that the eyepiece be exactly perpendicular to the collimator from this angle we lock the eyepiece and unlock the diffraction table we place a reflective mirror in the slit holder and rotate the diffraction table until the reflect light from the desk lamp be incident on the centre of the crosshairs in the eyepiece this ensures that the grate holder be now position at an angle of 45 • to the collimator we take a note of this reading and add 45 • before rotate the diffraction table until it be at the require angle now the diffraction holder be align perpendicular to the ray from the collimator for the remainder of the experiment the diffraction table will remain lock in this position this alignment procedure be show in fig 3. fig 3 calibrate the spectrometer -it be essential that the spectrometer be align such that the incidence ray be perpendicular to the diffraction grate in order to prevent the effect of oblique incidence 10 initially we use grate 1 a this will produce a wider intensity pattern and will therefore have a small percentage error in the diffraction angle measurement we turn off external source of light and position a hydrogen lamp close to the slit of the collimator then we place the diffraction grate into the grate holder and rotate the eyepiece until the crosshairs be centre on the central fringe for each colour of spectral line visible we record the angle of the spectral line for each order up to the maximum visible order afterwards we repeat the experiment use the 2nd grate to give u additional measurement of the wavelength in the balmer series a expect the fourth spectral line correspond to the wavelength λ 410nm be too dark to measure accurately therefore the final data consist of only three visible spectral line the complete dataset be include in appendix c for your inspection to be able to plot the data we have collect we first convert each angle from arc-minutes to it radian equivalent use the formula where α be the degree element of the angle and d be the arcminute element subsequently we normalise the angle of each colour by subtract the average of the m 0 order maximum from each of the measure angle thereby ensure that the central fringe occurs at θ 0rad plot each of the value of sin θ for normalise θ against order of maximum m produce a linear graph for each of the visible wavelength of the balmer series a show in fig 4. from the plot in fig 4 we can deduce the wavelength of each of the spectral line use eq 4. these result be summarise in table ii now for each of the value of n and calculate λ we plot 1/λ against 1/n 2 accord to the relationship specify in eq 2. these plot be show in fig 5. from these graph we calculate the rydberg constant a summarise in table iii the error calculation in table ii and table iii have be adjust to account for the uncertainty due to the resolution of an instrument a well a the systematic error discus below for example the vernier scale offer an accuracy of up to ±1 or ±0.0167 • but the actual uncertainty in each measurement of the angle be great this be primarily because fig 4 a plot of sin θ against m for both diffraction grate note that the red light have the steepest gradient a it have the long wavelength which confirms the relationship in eq 5. with the 1st grate the maximum be spread far apart but their intensity reduces with θ so only the first three order of maximum be visible for the 2nd grate the percentage error in each measurement of the angle be great than with the denser grate but more maximum be visible with this grate and therefore the overall error in the wavelength be low of a significant parallax error when reading the vernier scale which give error up to ±3 depend on the angle the scale be be read from to minimise this we try to read the scale from directly above additionally the dark condition in the room meant that it be difficult for our eye to determine the exact point at which the engrave of the vernier scale line up sometimes lead to disagreement in the reading of up to ±6 furthermore there would be an error associate with the measurement of the angle of the central fringe which be propagate through each reading when the angle be normalise this central fringe angle be calculate from an average of three reading and therefore be likely to have a small error of around ±0.5 another source of error related to the alignment of the grate be in relation to the use of a mirror the mirror reflect light upon incidence with it surface but a diffraction grate diffracts light after it pas through the surface if we assume that the thickness of the mirror be approximately 2mm this would cause a shift in the reflection by up to fig 5 a plot of the inverse wavelength 1/λ against 1/n 2 where n be the quantum number of the energy level in the balmer series a specify in table i for the n 300mm −1 grate φ 64 see fig 6 which would impact the alignment throughout the experiment this error could be minimise by use a thinner mirror use a spectrometer which have a large distance between the diffraction grate and the eyepiece or hold the mirror on the outer side of the grate holder so that the thickness of the mirror can be neglect the systematic error due to the thickness of the mirror can not be measure by experiment since all of the measure value be affected by this systematic error and be therefore consistent however note that the misalignment of the diffraction grate cause all of the spectral line to shift by φ but this should not impact the relative angle between order and therefore should not be account for in the error calculation above accounting for these factor the uncertainty in our measurement of the angle be more than the resolution of the vernier scale it be reasonable to assume that this error be likely to be approximately ±6 which be what have be use for the measurement in table ii a minor source of error be in the value of the line density of each grate we be told that the line density be n 300mm −1 and n 80mm −1 nominally and these be often accurately produce with error approximately σ n ±0.001mm −1 however the diffraction grate be use and have scratch surface which would diminish their ability to diffract light therefore a conservative estimate of fig 6 a possibility of an error arise in the alignment of the spectrometer due to a finite thickness of the mirror the error in these diffraction grate be 0.1 these error have also be account for in the error calculation in table ii lastly we consider the error contribution due to external source or change condition for example heating of the hydrogen lamp may cause it to emit additional wavelength of light if the tube be not adequately evacuate in our experiment we observe an unexpected yellow spectral line while take measurement while we could not determine the source of the yellow spectral line we decide to ignore it a erroneous and focus primarily on those colour we have predict in our theory but this introduces the possibility that there be other erroneous spectral line in our data to prevent change temperature condition from affect our result we take the precaution of measure the result alternately -that be first red line then violet line then blue line -to ensure there be no immediate pattern in term of the wavelength of the light that could have be impact by the change external condition the final table of error contribution in the value of the rydberg constant be show in table iv the error in the rydberg constant be mostly due to the error in the diffraction angle of σ θ ±6 which subsequently impact upon the error in the wavelength of light from the balmer series however this error be reduce by take repeat reading in use the spectrometer we be able to accurately determine the angle of diffraction for different wavelength by measure the angle at which their spectral line form on an emission spectrum the spectrometer offer an accuracy of ±1 but we be unable to take advantage of this accuracy due to systematic inaccuracy e.g parallax error however we be able to collect a significant amount of data in order to reduce the effect of random error for each wavelength and each order we take up to three measurement and be able to take the average of these to a good degree of accuracy this be a strength of the experiment -the ability to reproduce the same result with consistency and very small fluctuation due to random error a limitation of this experiment be that it rely on the balmer series because it be the only series that produce visible light for the hydrogen atom in the balmer series we be only able to observe 3 of the possible 4 visible wavelength of light which meant that while our error in the wavelength could be reduce by do repeat measurement the error in the rydberg constant be great owe to the fact that we only have three data point for the rydberg plot this be the reason for repeat the experiment with the n 78.8mm −1 grate to provide additional data point for the rydberg plot however a more effective technique would have enable u to measure the wavelength of light from the ultraviolet spectrum e.g by use a uv image camera provide additional data point to more accurately determine the rydberg constant a weakness of this method of determine the rydberg constant be that it assumes the bohr model perfectly describes energy level transition for atom however the bohr model be not completely accurate a it do not account for the effect of fine structure 11 -which concern relativity on an atomic level and electron spin -and hyperfine splitting 12 which take into consideration the existence of electron cloud rather than energy level a a result of these effect the rydberg constant be often not measure directly from observation of the spectral line instead emission spectrum of hydrogen and deuterium be use before make adjustment for the fine structure hyperfine splitting and a finite nuclear mass a more accurate method would account for these effect in summary we use the balmer series of hydrogen to calculate the wavelength of photon emit when electron transition from energy level n 3 4 5 to p 2 use a spectrometer and grate of line density n 300mm −1 and n 78.8mm −1 with eq 4. we then plot our calculate wavelength accord to the relationship in eq 2 and calculate the rydberg constant from both the gradient and the y-intercept quantity use eq 6 and eq 7. use the n 300mm −1 grate we calculate r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.03 × 10 7 m −1 and r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and y-intercept respectively for the n 78.8mm −1 grate we have r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 and r ∞ 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and y-intercept respectively the intensity pattern of the single slit envelope be govern by the expression sin 2 α α 2 while the

section 2 and the relation include a constant of proportionality r ∞ the rydberg constant this relation be of importance a hydrogen be abundant in the universe the emission spectrum of which provide insight in many area such a astronomy this experiment determines the rydberg constant by measure the wavelength of some of the spectral emission line of different energy level transition this be do by use of a spectrometer which pas the light from a hydrogen lamp through a diffraction grate separate the light of different wavelength across multiple diffraction fringe at angle to the normal of the grate by measure the angle of these fringe to the normal the correspond wavelength can be determine and subsequently the rydberg constant can also be determine the use of a spectrometer allows for a high degree of precision a it allows the angle of diffraction of light from the source to be measure to the order of arc-minutes the wavelength of a photon emit by a hydrogen atom be give by the rydberg formula 2 where λ be the wavelength of the photon emit r ∞ be the rydberg constant and p and n be principle quantum number which take integer value for the energy level that the atom transition to and from respectively for the spectrum of wavelength in the visible light spectrum know a the balmer series p 2 and n ≥ 3. therefore a graph of for n correspond to λ will exhibit a relation of direct proportionality with gradient equal to the rydberg constant r ∞ r ∞ can also be express a a product of other fundamental physical constant 2 where c be the speed of light in vacuum m e be the mass of the electron α be the fine structure constant and h be the planck constant use the measure value of these constant 1 we obtain a value of r ∞ to which the result obtain in this

these graph suggest a direct proportionality relationship a be predict by equation 3 equation 3 predicts that the gradient of the line for each colour wavelength be give by gradient λ d where d be the

of the diffraction grate specifies approximately 78.8 line per millimetre with negligible error relative to other error in this experiment allow the first three emission wavelength of the balmer

m equation 1 predicts that the gradient of the graph of λ against n be give in figure 5 the gradient of this line be 1.10 × 10 7 ± 1 × 10 5 m −1 and therefore the result be that the rydberg constant have be measure to be the error on this result could be low significantly with the spectrometer experimental set-up in particular this experiment take no repeat reading due to time constraint but do so would reduce the error similarly take reading to high value of m and take reading for more than three of the wavelength in the spectrum would reduce the error significantly the error on each angle reading could be reduce far if the focus of the spectrometer be improve and the slit narrow make each fringe narrower this experiment set out measure the rydberg constant which relates the wavelength

applicable to any energy state transition in a hydrogen atom and therefore any hydrogen-like atom where λ be the wavelength of the light emit r be the rydberg constant and n 1 and n 2 be the initial and final energy level respectively the rydberg equation give u a very accurate way of calculate the wavelength of the photon release when an electron in a hydrogen atom de-excites to a low energy level exploration of hydrogen emission line have proven to be very important in the development of modern physic consider the fact hydrogen make up 75 of the element in our universe moreover the development of the rydberg equation lead to bohr 's model of the atom and the quantum revolution in this investigation the balmer line will be explore this be because some of the balmer line have wavelength which lie in the visible region whereas lyman line n 2 1 and paschen line n 2 3 have wavelength which lie in the infra-red and ultra-violet region respectively a diffraction grate spectrometer will be use to analyse the spectral line to obtain the constituent wavelength of light from a hydrogen lamp use these wavelength and rydberg 's formula equation 1 we can deduce an experimental value for r. when a hydrogen lamp be connect to a power source and turn on light of specific wavelength be emit a the high-energy electron pa through the hydrogen gas they interact with the hydrogen atom and cause them to excite once the electron in the hydrogen shell be in the high energy state it then naturally de-excites to a low energy state release a photon in the process the energy of the photon release upon de-excitation be equal to the energy change of the electron across the two energy state the equation that relates the energy level change in hydrogen to the wavelength of light release be call the rydberg equation -see equation 1. sometimes the rydberg constant be write a r ∞ where the '∞ indicates that we be assume that the mass of the electron be

since the photon release be in the visible part of the electromagnetic em spectrum one would be able to see the light from a hydrogen lamp with the naked eye it be indeed the case that at least three of the balmer emission line be visible to the human eye through a grate spectrometer when light pas through the diffraction grate in the grate spectrometer it get split into it constituent colour this

the graph give value for θ with very little error this be expect consider the quality of the result obtain the point fit very well with the best-fit line the value for θ a we previously have establish be related to the wavelength λ by equation 3. this mean that we can calculate the value for λ for each value of θ. the error be calculate use the fact that the error of sin θ be co θ × σ θ the error

emission line graph show in figure 3 do not fit on the line of best-fit despite the low error chance of random error the final result be 1.28 different from the accepted value of r. however this be very likely to be because of a systematic error during the experimental procedure consider the value for λ that have be calculate be high than the accepted value for the balmer line this be displayed in table 2. here we can see that for b α and b γ the percentage difference be similar this suggests a possibility of a systematic error which provokes a high measurement for the value of λ. nonetheless we can not say this with certainty because the measure value for b β be small than the accepted value a potential source of error be the value for d the diffraction grate line space the value be not experimentally test during this investigation it be simply quote a 78.8 line per millimetre and thus an estimate of the error have to be make to test this value for d a light source of

b γ the wavelength be great than the true value it be possible that the fringe space be great than the value for d use 1.27×10 −5 m another source of error may have be the alignment of the diffraction

with a separate atom in the ground state 3 r ∞ and the rydberg formula both arise from rutherford-bohr model an approximation of the structure of the atom it can also be described in term of more fundamental constant although the most accurate measurement of the rydberg constant come from measure it constituent and more fundamental constant our investigation be to find the rydberg constant through the measurement of transition wavelength in hydrogen a this be far easy to perform in a laboratory these wavelength come from a relatively simple formula know a the rydberg formula an equation which relates the wavelength of emit photon to the initial and final energy level of the atom they come from for a hydrogen atom the wavelength of light emit from an atom with a final energy level of 2 and an initial energy level of 3,4,5 etc fall within the visible region of electromagnetic radiation this series of wavelength be know a the balmer series after johann balmer a swiss mathematician and physicist who discover them and an equation to calculate them in 1885. due to the abundance of hydrogen in the universe this series be especially useful in astronomy these balmer line can appear a either absorption or emission line depend on the source for our experiment a hydrogen lamp be use and so emission line be observe and measure the emission line from the hydrogen lamp be analyse with a grate spectrometer this comprises of a collimator that pas light normally through a diffraction grate disperse the spectral line the angle of diffraction of these spectral line be then measure use an eyepiece that rotates freely about the grate fig 2. the grate spectrometer be use because of it high precision and accuracy enable the measurement of the wavelength of a give sample of light to nanometer precision once the value of the wavelength be know the rydberg formula can be use to find the rydberg constant by graphical analysis the rutherford-bohr model be one of the simplest approximation of the structure of the atom apply mostly classical physic in this model the electron orbit around the nucleus in the same way that planet orbit around a star if we consider an electron orbit a hydrogen nucleus it total energy must be described by where e be the total energy of the electron v be the potential energy of the electron and t be the kinetic energy of the electron a the only force between the nucleus and the electron in the model be the electromagnetic force it can be show that this total energy be give by where k be 4π 0 −1 with 0 be the permittivity of free space e be the magnitude of the charge of an electron and r be the radius of the `` orbit `` of the electron it can also be show that the angular momentum of the electron must be quantise and so combine these discrete value of velocity with the equivalence of centripetal and electrostatic force we find where n be an integer arise from the quantisation of angular momentum and m e be the mass of the electron when n 1 r give the bohr radius substitute this back into equation 1 we get an expression for the total energy of a give energy level n a an electron jump from a high energy level to a low one the difference in energy between these two level be emit a a photon see fig 1. equate this energy difference to the energy of a photon give where λ be the wavelength of the emit photon n 2 be the initial energy level n 1 be the final energy level make n 1 n 2 and r ∞ be the rydberg constant give by where c be the speed of light in a vacuum h be plank 's constant and α be the fine structure constant 4 give by it be from this definition of the rydberg constant that the high accuracy measurement have be make however a λ n 1 and n 2 be know it be not need for this experiment allow the use of equation 5 directly in derive the total energy of the electron it be assume that the mass of the nucleus when compare to the electron be infinite denote by the subscript ∞ consider a finite ratio between the two mass coffman show 5 that the formula becomes where with m e be the mass of the electron and m be the total mass of the nucleus although not necessary for this particular experiment the rydberg formula can also be expand to describe other element that behave in a similar manner to hydrogen with the formula where z be the atomic number of the element if we take equation 5 rearrange for λ use the accepted value of r ∞ a 1.0974 × 10 7 m −1 and take n 1 a 2 then we can find the value of λ for n 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... ∞ table i. a these value be only for hydrogen the first spectral line be commonly refer to a h-α the second h-β and so on the first four spectral line be in the visible spectrum and so can be detect by the human eye all other line with these parameter lie in the ultraviolet region this series of spectral line with n 1 2 be know a the balmer series although more in depth analysis of the diffraction grate be possible for determination of resolution and to show the presence of secondary peak only the principal maximum be use in this experiment if an arbitrary point be consider that be illuminate by a diffraction grate a principal maximum will only occur if the path difference between neighbour slit to the give point be an integer multiple of 2π this mean that the phase difference φ be give by where s be the path difference between adjacent slit k be the wavenumber and m be a positive or negative integer a s d sin θ and k 2π λ then give and so through measurement of θ and m with the grate spectrometer determination of λ be possible for a give colour these value of λ can then be use with equation 5 to find r ∞ before start the experiment equation 5 be use along with the accepted value of the rydberg constant to calculate the expect wavelength of the first five spectral line of the balmer series table i. these wavelength be then convert into visible colour with colour chart from these value it be predict that all line with n 2 ≥ 5 would be in the ultraviolet range and so it be expect that four line would be visible to the eye the hydrogen lamp use to produce the spectral line would overheat if left on for more than approximately 15 minute when this occurs the lamp no longer produce accurate spectral line and will not turn on before cool to low temperature in extreme case this can cause permanent damage to the lamp for this reason the initial calibration of the grate spectrometer be do use a sodium lamp a a substitute this be use a the sodium lamp produce clear spectral line in a similar manner to the hydrogen lamp whilst not suffer from overheat the collimator and diffraction grate see fig 2 have to be perfectly align to ensure light would be incident normally on the diffraction grate minimise the error in the position reading the eyepiece be first focus on the cross-hair with an object 5-10m away the opposite wall of the laboratory be use the collimator be then calibrate by adjust the focus of the collimator until the source through the slit be at it sharpest a see through the eyepiece the slit width be minimise but not so much that the observe spectral line become hard to view the purpose of these step be both to minimise eye strain and to minimise the spread in the spectral line minimise the error in θ. the camera be then rotate by exactly 90 • and a mirror use in place of the diffraction grate to precisely align the diffraction grate mount the diffraction grate use have 2001 line per inch approximately 78.8 line per mm it be predict that four wavelength would be visible when use the hydrogen lamp table i. however initially only the red and aqua line be observe upon replace the hydrogen lamp the red aqua and violet spectral line be then visible but not dark blue from discussion with other team it become apparent that many lamp be not show all of the expect spectral line and so we decide to use the lamp despite only be able to observe three wavelength the cause of this be unknown however it be likely due to fig 2. a simplify top-down deconstruction of a grate spectrometer 4 the source slit collimator and grate remain fix whilst the camera crosshair and eyepiece rotate freely about the grate omit be the vernier scale in arc minute use to measure angle of rotation θ. for the gradient and their associate error see table ii either overheat of the lamp from previous usage or from other manufacturing defect the position of the spectral line of each colour be then measure by align the cross-hair of the eyepiece with the centre of the line the value on the vernier scale of the grate spectrometer be then record a the scale be in arc minute the error in θ be ±1 for each colour the position of the central line be measure follow by 3-5 line either side depend on their clarity the central line be of order 0 and far line along increase θ be decide to be of increase order and vice versa when the brightness of the line be such that their colour could not be determine with relative ease their position be no longer record to reduce the chance of the lamp overheat due to prolong usage reading be take for period of 5-10 minute with break of a few minute in between to allow to the lamp to cool to obtain a quantitative measurement of the error in the position of the spectral line the width of the 0 th order line of each colour be directly measure for later use see section iv-b this be do by take two position measurement one for each side of the fringe the wavelength of each spectral line be found from equation 13. this give λ a the gradient of the plot of d sin θ against m fig 3. the value of the calculate gradient in table ii all contain the expect value of λ from table i within their associate margin of error equation 5 be then use with the value of λ and n 2 from table ii to calculate the rydberg constant fig 4. through swap the two reciprocal term of n 2 1 an n 2 2 the gradient becomes r ∞ this give r ∞ to be 1.096×10 7 ±1.4×10 5 m −1 the accepted value of r ∞ be 1.0974 × 10 7 m −1 meaning that the calculate result be 0.1σ from the accepted value the main source of error within the dataset be from the human judgement of the centre of the spectral line to quantify this rather than estimate an uncertainty the width of an individual fringe of each wavelength be measure see section iii-b through subtract the great of these two angle from the other and combine the error for each in quadrature the total width of the line could be found halve the width and then combine this with it associate error in quadrature give the total error in each line position measurement for each wavelength see table iii this spread of each line be cause by the finite width of the slit and the diffraction of the light a it pas through it this effect be far amplify by any error in the focus of the collimator and the camera lens arrangement lead to a small but measurable spread in the observe position of each line error in the calibration of the grate spectrometer i.e the light not be normally incident on the diffraction grate also lead to systematic error in the line position these effect be mostly remove by use of a linear regression model all far calculate error be found from these line of regression initially the calculate wavelength of the violet light be found to be great than that of the aqua colour it be widely i. this meant that n 1 2 and n 2 3 4 and 6 a dark blue be not observe the gradient r∞ be found to be 1.096 × 10 7 ± 1.4 × 10 5 m −1 accepted that this be not true upon inspection of the violet data fig 5 it be found that at the two end of the dataset the position deviate dramatically whereas the central section remain linear and closely match the expect value upon remove these anomalous data point the gradient of the trend line of the central data point give a value far closer to the expect value calculate beforehand this new value be use in the calculation of r ∞ the cause of these peculiar anomaly may have be down to mis-association of the colour to the record line position a the brightness of the line decrease with distance from the central line this could explain why only the outermost line be anomalous many other dark line be observe however a their colour could not be determine accurately they be not record overall the error in the final result be reasonable consider it be found from only three data point fig 4. ideally all four wavelength would have be visible and repeat measurement of each spectral line would have be take to far reduce the error in r ∞ unfortunately due to the lack of another replacement hydrogen lamp and the lack of laboratory time allocate this be not possible both of these factor greatly increase the error in the final value the aim of the experiment be to find the rydberg constant through measurement of the spectral line of the balmer series through use of the rydberg formula r ∞ be found to be 1.096 × 10 7 ± 1.4 × 10 5 m −1 this be 0.1σ from the accepted value of 1.0974 × 10 7 m −1 this final error be mainly due to the lack of repeat be take and due to only three of the four wavelength be visible in future the accuracy of the experiment could have be greatly improve through address these issue the knowledge and experience gain through use of the grate spectrometer and through work a a team to gather meaningful data from it can and will be directly apply to future project\"\n"," \"in this investigation we be determine the rydberg constant use hydrogen lamp and spectrometer we estimate the constant to be 1.046±0.022x𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 the accepted value for the constant be 1.097x𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 therefore the experiment be 4.65 accurate in the experiment we use a spectrometer and hydrogen lamp the spectrometer be an effective way to determine wavelength of light precisely and accurately by measure wavelength of the light that be emit from a hydrogen lamp we can determine the rydberg constant a the wavelength of light emit related to the rydberg formula for one of the wavelength measure we gain an anomalous result that be not part of any model in the rydberg formula although measurement for the other two wavelength do fit the model that the rydberg formula provide for this experiment we be determine the rydberg constant by observe the diffraction pattern when a beam of light from the emission of a hydrogen lamp be shone through a diffraction grate the light from a hydrogen lamp be not make up of a continuous spectrum of light but of distinct colour the distinct colour be due to the quantisation of energy level in electron in the hydrogen atom a the hydrogen gas be excite the electron in the hydrogen be promote energy level that be distinct and quantise see appendix a for diagram when the electron lose energy they be demote energy level and release a photon of light a the difference in energy level be distinct and not continuous only photon of certain wavelength be emit these wavelength can be estimate use spectroscopy technique the wavelength relates to the rydberg constant and the energy level the electron be promote to in the experiment the wavelength be determine use spectroscopy technique from multiple grate diffraction theory the wavelength of light can be estimate for the light emit and from this the rydberg constant be estimate the rydberg constant be very important in atomic physic and even in astrophysics the rydberg constant can predict the wavelength of light emit for hydrogen and ionise element with the same number of electron a hydrogen the rydberg constant can be use to model wavelength of photon emit in excite hydrogen thus it have important application in astrophysics by observe light from star or any other celestial body astronomer can shine the light through a grate similar to the one we use in the experiment can confirm presence of hydrogen 1 to determine the rydberg constant the value of the wavelength emit from the excite hydrogen must be estimate this be do by a graph the graph be sin theta against order of maximum this mean that the gradient be equivalent to the wavelength of light emit the light observe be red cyan green and blue with wavelength calculate to be 487.2±7.3nm 659.3±2.7nm 532.6±9.6nm respectively from this we get the rydberg constant to measure 1.046±0.022x10 7 𝑚 −1 this experiment u multiple grate diffraction theory to estimate the wavelength of the emit light the grate be make of equally space narrow slit each with a distance between them of d. suppose there be phase difference of neighbour ray of wavelength λ if the phase difference be an integer multiple of 2π then there be constructive interference of maximum intensity a show in appendix b the path difference be dsinθ the phase difference be calculate by 1 where ϕ be the phase difference a we be interested in the diffraction pattern for when there be a maximum constructive interference we know that ϕ be equivalent to 2πm where m=0 ±1 ±2 .. etc therefore we can equate 1.1 to 1.2 determine the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and spectrometer by cancel the 2π term and multiply by λ we derive 1.3 which we use for the analysis of result for the spectrometer 1.3 λ be related to the rydberg constant by 1.4 2 this be due to quantum effect of the electron in the hydrogen atom the electron in the hydrogen atom be at specific energy level when the hydrogen atom be in an excite state the electron be raise by an energy level or to even high specific energy level once the hydrogen atom be not in an excite state the electron in the excite state demotes an energy level when this happens photon be emit from the atom the energy of this photon be equivalent to the difference in energy of the electron energy level therefore in 1.4 p equal the final energy level and n equal the energy level of the electron in the excite state for visible light to be emit the electron 's final state be in the p=2 state any high would result in the photon be emit have a wavelength in the region of infrared light if the final state be low the photon will be in the uv spectrum in the experiment we be determine the wavelength of the light emit we research the balmer series for hydrogen appendix b so n and p be know 4 rearrange 1.4 can give a result for the rydberg constant iii method figure 1 show an example of a very similar spectrometer use 3 the slow motion drive or rotate table varies the angle of the eyepiece with cross hair the cross hair be line up with maximas when the angle θ be measure on the slow motion drive a the spectral line be of a certain thickness due to the slit before the collimator this provide an uncertainty in θ. we determine the uncertainty to be half the thickness of the spectral line a the true angle of maximum could lie within the region of the spectral line at the central maximum θ=0 and this be the point where the eye piece and the collimator where completely parallel to each other it be also require that the plane of the grate be exactly perpendicular to the collimator and be perfectly level this be so that 1.3 be valid we make sure that this be the case by the follow step first we align the eyepiece with the collimator without put in the diffraction grate next we rotate the eyepiece by 90˚ and clamped it into position the eyepiece and collimator be therefore perpendicular to each other we then place the grate in the holder and rotate it until we could see the reflect image of the slit align with the cross hair of the eyepiece this meant that now the grate be at an angle of 45˚ a show by figure 3. when this point be reach we rotate the grate by exactly 45 degree this assure that the grate plane be perpendicular to the light beam come out the collimator the eye piece be then rotate 90 degree exactly so that the eye piece and telescope axis be parallel to the light beam to obtain value of theta the telescope be rotate use the fine adjustment screw on the rotate table and the value of theta be read off on a vernier scale the vernier scale have a precision of 1 arc minute the hydrogen lamp be not like other lamp and can not be kept on for a long time we estimate the rydberg constant to be 1.046±0.022x10 7 𝑚 −1 this be close to the accepted value of 1.097x10 7 𝑚 −1 2 we observe the hydrogen to emit three distinct colour blue red and cyan green with wavelength 487.2±2.3nm 659.3±2.7nm 532.6±3.6nm respectively below show a graph of sin θ a a function of m. there be a strong linear fit with the graph and small uncertainty in value of sin θ for each of the colour the gradient of this graph be equivalent to the wavelength of the light divide by the distance between the slit grate there be small uncertainty with the estimation of the wavelength when research the balmer series 4 the value of the wavelength for light emit be similar for the blue and red spectral line for the red light beam the wavelength be meant to be 656.1nm which be very close to our value of 659.3nm and for the blue light beam the wavelength be meant to be 486.0nm which be again close to our estimate value of 487.2nm however the presence of light with the 532.6nm wavelength be not part of the balmer series this result be also not due to one anomalous result a the graph show a strong linear fit with each of the distinct colour a possible cause for this be that there be another light source go through the diffraction pattern but this seem unlikely a the measurement of the wavelength for this light be very precise and if this be the case it would have have to be a laser therefore we do not calculate the rydberg constant for this light beam when we estimate the rydberg constant we obtain value for the rydberg constant for the individual light beam and take the mean a the result infront of the collimator be a slit that make the light source a light beam however the slit have certain thickness and provide an uncertainty in theta a the light beam have a certain thickness we estimate the result of theta a the central part of the beam to measure the uncertainty we record theta the edge of the ligh tbeam the uncertainty be the difference in theta for the edge of the light beam and we divide this by a half below show a visualisation of the measurement of the uncertainty\"\n"," \"the emission spectrum of hot hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the visible transition wavelength which lie on balmer series be observe and measure the rydberg constant r∞ which relates the energy level in the atom to the transition wavelength be calculate the value of r∞ obtain be 1.10±0.04 × 10 7 m -1 the result be what we expect and it also verifies the rydberg formula spectroscopy be the study of electromagnetic spectrum which be the wavelength composition of light due to atomic and molecular interaction a grate spectrometer u a diffract grate to disperse the incident polychromatic light into it constituent monochromatic component 3 in this experiment the emission spectrum of hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the rydberg formula explains the relation between the transition wavelength and the energy level with the proportionality constant be the rydberg constant the information about the wavelength of the emission spectrum be use to deduce the rydberg constant the word spectrum be first apply by isaac newton to describe the rainbow of colour that combine to form white light during the early 1800s joseph von fraunhofer conduct experiment with dispersive spectrometer that enable spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique 4 since then spectroscopy have become important in the study of physic and it be equally crucial in the astronomical biological chemical metallurgical and other analytical investigation 3 figure 2.0 show the electromagnetic spectrum of light that range from radio wave to gamma ray correspond to their wavelength 8 the electromagnetic spectrum can be anything from long infrared all the way down to gamma ray a show by figure 2.0. the light might have originate from anything from a cool crystal to a superhot plasma or from a star 1 the light spectrum generally take one of two form firstly hot solid such a a tungsten lamp filament emits a continuous spectrum of intensity that vary with wavelength secondly hot or electrically excite gas release spectrum that have concentrate emission at a few well-defined wavelength a see from the slit of the spectrometer a show by figure 2.1. this form be call 'emission line spectrum the ratio of intensity of spectral line for example can provide information about the density of the emit gas or the density of the free electron in an electrical discharge since the spectroscopy be a `` non-invasive `` technique it be one of the most powerful tool available to physicist 1 figure 2.1. show the emission spectrum of various element these line have well define position which correspond to well-defined wavelength 9 these gas also show 'absorption line spectrum which occurs when a continuous white light be pas through their cool state instead of emit spectral line the gas absorb the well-defined wavelength of light and reemit in random direction result in dark line in a continuous spectrum a see in figure 2.2 2 however the focus of the experiment will be on the emission line spectrum of hot hydrogen lamp determine the rydberg constant use the grate spectrometer the absorption spectrum of helium with well-defined dark line on the continuous spectrum of white light 10 a spectrometer need a dispersive object to disperse or separate the different wavelength of the incident light spatially 3 in our experiment we use a diffraction grate diffraction be a wave phenomenon that occurs when a wave encounter an obstacle or a slit 2 a grate can be consider a a large n of equally space very narrow slit 1 each slit be separate by a distance d 1 where m be the order number 1,2 here m take value of 0 1 and 2. in this experiment the value at the opposite direction take negative value such -1 and -2. the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen be divide into a number of spectral series spectral emission occurs when an electron transition from a high energy state to a low energy state to differentiate the two state the low energy state be designate a p and the high energy state be designate a n. since the energy of each state be fix the energy difference between the state be fix and the transition will always produce a photon with the same energy 5 hydrogen atom correspond to the wavelength of the photon emit 13 this experiment focus on balmer series since lyman series and paschen series do not involve photon that lie in the visible range so the value of p in this case be 2. the energy difference between level and hence the wavelength of emit photon be give by the rydberg formula 5 where r∞ be the rydberg constant which have the measure value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 it can be express in term of more fundamental constant a where me be the mass of electron c be the speed of light h be plank 's constant and α be the fine structure constant the value of 1/α ≈ 137.036 1,6 before proceed to make measurement the spectrometer be first properly alinged and focus firstly the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire `` x `` to find a set that do not strain the eye the instrument be brought outside the work space to a window the camera lens be focus so that a distant object be focus on the cross wire the distant object chosen be another window across the street since the distant in this context mean 5 to 10 metre 1 the telescope be set so that it be alinged with the axis of the collimator the hydrogen lamp be position close to the slit so that it be illuminate without change the camera focus the focus of the collimator be adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire the slit be adjust to it minimum width and the cross wire be set a an `` x `` rather than a a `` `` it be checked how the clamp screw and the slow motion drive work the camera and collimator be alinged so the cross wire be set on the slit image the telescope be move through precisely 90 deg by note the intial and final position on the vernier scale and clamped in position a mirror be put in the holder and the ruling be ensure approximately vertical the grate table that hold the mirror be turn until a reflect image of the slit be observe in the eyepiece this indicates the grate surface be at 45 deg to the incident from the collimator the height of this image be adjust use the adjustment screw under the grate table the reading be note the grate be rotate through precisely 45 degree use the scale so that it be accurately set at 0 deg normal incidence the mirror be replace with a grate slit the telescope be then move out of the way and look into the grate the telescope be move around to find the diffract image of the slit if the image be above or below the plane define by the cross wire the grate adjustment screw be use to rotate the grate in the plane of it surface until the image be at right height the spectrometer be now set up to make measurement the hydrogen lamp be only switch on whenever the measurement be go to be make since it get hots and the intensity of the emission line drop until they be not visible in the eyepiece the grate slit that have 78.8 line per mm 1 be chosen since it show more emission line up to 3 order number the hydrogen lamp be turn on and the diffract image be observe in the eyepiece the position of the centre of the diffration pattern be measure here the centre represent the zeroth order in the grate equation i.e eq 2.2. the first order m=1 of emission line be observe in the first order one of the emission line look red and it position be record the step above be repeat for the second and third order and the order in the opposite direction the second visible wavelength be blue the position of the blue emission line be measure in the same manner a red 's the third visible emission line look bluish purple however the intensity of the third emission line be very low so the grate slit be change to another one with 300 line per mm 1 which provide high resolution but only the first and second order can be observe my partner and i take reading of the position of the same line alteratively to get a value for the uncertainty in the angle turn θ. the entire measure process be repeat multiple time for the three different emission line to increase the accuracy all reading be record on the lab book and then transfer to the computer to be analyse eq 2.2 implies a plot of the sin θ vs. m will yield a straight line a plot of sin θ a a function of m be plot on python for each transition wavelength use the information about the slope the wavelength of each emission line be determine with their uncertainty for each wavelength the rydberg constant be deduce with it uncertainty the plot of sin θ vs. m be plot on python for each transition wavelength the slope of the plot from figure 4.3 be 0.1294±0.0008 the d use be 3.33 × 10 -6 m. this be different from those use for previous plot since the grate slit be change for well resolution the wavelength of the emission line obtain be 4.3±0.1 × 10 -7 m. the error in the angle of the emission line θ for each transition wavelength be calculate from the standard deviation of the data the error in the wavelength for purple emission line be increase to 0.1×10 -7 m from a very small error since the intensity of the line be very low i suspect the error be big than the value obtain from standard deviation in summary the transition wavelength be give on the table below by compare the colour observe with the figure 2.6 the result be very similar visually but the second emission line be actually aqua light blue and the third one be blue not purple apart from that the wavelength do correspond to the colour observe in figure 2.6. also the forth emission line violet which be suppose to be visible be not observe this could be due to low intensity of the hydrogen lamp provide the rydberg constant r∞ be calculate for each transition wavelength by use eq 2.3. since the spectral line on balmer series be of the visible wavelength the wavelength obtain from the experiment correspond to the balmer series therefore the value of p energy level of the final level in this experiment be 2. the result be summarise by the table below colour n λ 10 -7 m r∞ 10 the average of the value of r∞ obtain be 1.10±0.04 × 10 7 m -1 the percentage difference when compare to the measure value be 0.2 the measure value also lie within the range of the average 1.06,1.14 × 10 7 m -1 the error in the average be relatively large thus result in a large range however the measure value be very close to the average there be a few possible source of error which could have affected the final result for example the hydrogen lamp get hot and the intensity drop make it difficult to spot the line we also change the lamp for a few time and the position of the lamp might have be change sometimes the whole set up be move by accident which could have cause the set up to be misalingned hence a set up fix to table must be use with a well long last hydrogen lamp even though the experiment be carry out in a dark room there be table lamp on our neighbour table which could have affected the incident light into the diffraction grate therefore an opaque shield should be use to cover it leave a hole for the eyepiece besides the grate holder could have be move during the change of the grate slit the temperature and humidity be possible error source too since they can affect the system optic 3 therefore the temperature and humidity should be monitor and regulate during the experiment the emission spectrum produce by hot hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the visible transition wavelength which lie on balmer series be observe and measure the rydberg constant r∞ which relates the energy level in the atom to the transition wavelength be calculate the value of r∞ obtain be 1.10±0.04 × 10 7 m -1 when compare to the measure value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 the percentage difference be 0.2 the result be what we expect this also verifies the rydberg formula i.e eq 2.3. it should be note that the grate spectrometer be highly accurate and the lab script claim to give a precision of ±0.2nm for the wavelength of yelloworange light if repeat measurement be take 1 since the small error in λ we can achieve be ±4nm we be still a long way from reach the uncertainty of ±0.2nm therefore the experiment should be repeat multiple time with more careful procedure consider the step discus in the previous section apart from that this experiment only investigates the visible transition wavelength of hydrogen i.e balmer series the other spectral line such a those from lyman series and paschen series should be study and be use to determine the rydberg constant a they be also related to it by eq 2.3 5 besides hydrogen any hydrogen-like element can be use to determine r∞ too 5\"\n"," 'the rydberg constant be calculate by use a grate spectrometer to observe the hydrogen emission spectrum the wavelength correspond to different electron transition be measure by the spectrometer these value be then use to calculate the rydberg constant via the rydberg formula the experiment lead to an answer of 10 960 518 m -1 whereas literature value state it a 10 973 732 m -1 this result be accurate to within 0.15 which suggests that this be an accurate method of obtain the rydberg constant spectrometry be a method of analyse electromagnetic radiation from which the chemical composition of the light source can be obtain in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen in order to calculate the rydberg constant the grate spectrometer u a series of lens to collimate light this light then pas through a diffraction grate which cause a dispersion spectrum this spectrum be define by the wavelength of light which enter the spectrometer the disperse light be focus and can be observe by the experimenter a hydrogen atom have a single electron occupy different energy level depend on the state of the atom the low energy level be refer to the ground state and the most stable configuration for the electron occurs when it occupies this level the electron can be excite to a high energy state if there be an input of energy such a a collision with a photon of appropriate energy the electron absorbs energy and be promote to a high energy state however this configuration be less stable and the electron will lose energy by emission of a photon and fall to a low energy level the energy of the emit photon corresponds to a specific wavelength of light which can be detect by mean of a spectrometer the majority of energy transition correspond to wavelength which be outside the visible spectrum transition from a high energy level to the ground energy level n 1 lead to wavelength in the ultraviolet region transition to the second low energy level n 2 and the third low energy level n 3 correspond to spectrum in the visible and infrared region respectively since the energy level be discrete the energy of the photon and therefore wavelength be also discrete this lead to spectral line be observe rather than a continuous spectrum of wavelength or colour the light which enters the spectrometer will be a superposition of all the wavelength of light cause by electron transition the diffraction grate will cause the light to disperse a different wavelength of light be diffract by different angle in order for constructive interference to occur and a wavelength of visible light to be observe from the eyepiece the phase difference must be equal to an integer multiple of 2π calculate the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer'\n"," \"the same set up be use a that in figure 1. before the experiment could be carry out the spectrometer have to be accurately set up and calibrate with a sodium lamp before the hydrogen lamp be use to do this first the eye piece be focus onto the crosshair then use an object that be five to ten meter away the camera lens be focus so that there be no parallax between the image and the crosshair once this be do the spectrometer be set up in a straight configuration without any grate in the middle and the sodium lamp source be turn on then without adjust the camera the collimator be focus until a sharp image of the slit appear once this be do the grate then have to be accurately put in place the telescope the combination of camera and eyepiece be rotate through exactly 90 degree and a grate be put in the holder the grate table be then turn until a reflect image of the entrance slit be see in the eye piece this show that the grate be at exactly 45 degree use adjustment screw under the grate table the height of the grate be adjust so that the image of the slit be precisely at the cross hair a note be make of the reading on the scale and the grate be rotate through exactly 45 degree to be align accurately with the incident ray from the collimator once this be do the spectrometer be set up and preliminary reading can be take on the sodium lamp to determine the accuracy the first order maximum on either side of the central maximum be measure at 3.5° this be then use to calculate the wavelength of the spectral line which be 610nm when compare with the accepted value of this sodium spectral line an error of 3.7 be found after this measurement of the rydberg constant could be take use the hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be not a bright a the sodium lamp so the size of the slit be adjust until the best image of the spectral line be achieve a grate of 77.8 line per mm be use first a note be take of what order the spectral line occur in and also how many of each line could be see then one specific colour be chosen and the spectrometer telescope be swung from left to right positive to negative order to measure the angle at which each occur it be ensure that the crosshair be in the center of the spectral line before a measurement of the angle be take this be then repeat for each colour of spectral line and for each a graph be plot of the sine of the angle against the order number make sure that the angle have be convert to radian this yield a straight line a can be see from equation 1 that will have a gradient of the wavelength divide by the space of the slit the negative of the angle be use for the negative order so that it creates a straight line these value of wavelength that be achieve can then be use to numerically determine the rydberg constant through calculation these can then be average to obtain a since value and it error use equation 2. displayed below in table 1 be the data for the angle and order of the red spectral line since the scale on the spectrometer do n't start at 0° for the central maximum the angle that be displayed be measure and from this the true angle subtend from the central maximum be determine this be the same for all the different spectral line displayed below in table 2 be the data for the angle and order of the blue spectral line all these measurement be take use a vernier scale on the spectrometer this give them a reading error of ±0.005° or ±0.0001 radian give the large percentage error of 0.3 this value be negligible compare to the error that arises from the graph the data from these table be then use to plot three separate graph to calculate the wavelength these value be then use to calculate the rydberg constant in each case use equation 2 where for each colour p=2 red compound the error form these three value to obtain a total error for the final value be do by 𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 √ 1.2 10 5 2 1.2 10 5 2 6.5 10 3 2 ± 1.7 10 5 𝑚 −1 𝑅 ∞ 1.09 10 7 ± 1.7 10 5 𝑚 −1 the aim of this experiment be to determine

this error could have be reduce with more accurate calibration of the equipment use the lithium lamp this would allow a more precise value to be obtain systematic error of the equipment be most likely the large source of error in this experiment along with make sure that the crosshair be in the spectrometer be directly in the middle of the spectral line\"\n"," \"the purpose of this report be to display the result of my experiment in which i attempt to calculate the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer the rydberg constant be a value which relates the frequency of photon emission which result from the transition of electron between discrete energy level in the atom the measurement be take use a collimator and a camera fit to a vernier scale with the use of a diffraction grate with 300 line per mm the final result of the experiment be 1.1005±0.0004 𝒎 −𝟏 this value be within less than 0.5 of the previously know value make the experiment successful pectroscopy be an extremely useful tool for scientific analysis it be a non-invasive technique which u light from a source to analyse the property of a substance or material the absorption or emission spectrum of the analyse material can provide key insight into the composition of the substance a specific element and compound have specific spectrum which they can absorb or emit for the purpose of this experiment hot hydrogen gas be use and it emission line be observe through a diffraction grate the eventual outcome of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant by use the relationship between wavelength and the degree of diffraction to calculate the wavelength of the light which the lamp emits the rydberg constant relates the wavelength of emit photon from a hydrogen atom for electron transmission between energy level for the purpose of this experiment a it be do by human observation the balmer emission series be use a it produce visible wavelength of light to calculate the wavelength of the light a spectrometer be use comprise of a collimator camera and vernier scale moreover the error in the calculate value be often on the order of a percent due to the precision of spectroscopy a a method however the rydberg constant can be use to calculate the wavelength of light emit from electron transition between any energy level outline below be additional theory which be require to understand the full detail of how the experiment work regard diffraction grate and the rydberg constant the diffraction grate can be assume to be a set of parallel narrow slit with separation d. thus if light of wavelength λ pas through a the grate a principle maximum occurs when all of the beam have a path difference which be a whole number of wavelength hence phase difference between adjacent wave be an integer multiple of 2π a show in equation 1.1 a path difference be 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 where θ be the deflection from the ray initial path then it follow hence plot 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against 𝜆 produce a straight line from which the gradient can be use to get an accurate value of 𝜆. the rydberg equation be a direct outcome of the quantum behaviour of electron a they can only occupy discrete energy level in the atom when electron in the hydrogen atom transition between energy level from high to low they release photon a the transition energy be discrete only certain wavelength of light be emit the equation 2.1 relates this in a remarkably simple fashion where the initial energy level be denote by n and the final level be denote by p. for visible wavelength emission there be p=2 and n=3 4 and 5. hence there should be 3 visible wavelength the measure value of the 𝑅 ∞ be 10 973 721.6 𝑚 −1 it be also give by equation 2.2 where 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light in a vacuum and h be plank 's constant finally 𝛼 be the fine structure constant give by 2.3 𝑒 2 4𝜋ħ𝜀 0 2.3 calculate the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer a. spectrometer setup prior to any measurement take it be vital to calibrate the spectrometer so that the measurement we take be accurate the follow procedure align and focus the instrument it be key to note that once one part of a calibration be complete it be n't change during the experiment a it could have effect measurement take 1. we focus the eyepiece on the cross wire by turn the eyepiece it be preferable to have the crosshairs a an x than a '+ 2. we then go to a window and focus the camera lens on a distant object to by twist the camera 3. then we align the collimator and camera and turn on a sodium lamp this be use in place of hydrogen lamp a the hydrogen lamp overheats and can only be on for 15 minute at a time turn the slit to it narrow set to reduce our error then we align the middle of the cross hair to the center of the sodium beam 4. we note the reading on the vernier scale at that point remember that the large reading be in degree and the small one be in arcminute 5. then we move the camera through 90 degree towards ourselves when we do this we make sure the other part of the spectrometer be lock in place and we rotate the vernier scale 45 degree in the opposite direction so that it would end up in the same place after the camera be move and not underneath the collimator hence we could still read it and take a measurement 6. we then place a mirror in the slot until we could see a reflect beam exactly in the middle of the crosshairs meaning that the camera be at exactly 90 degree to the collimator 7. we again note the vernier scale reading we subtract 90 degree from this reading and move the camera back around so that it be at precisely 0 degree to the normal hence make it perfectly align 8. the final step be to replace the mirror with the grate our image be level they do not change height in the horizontal plane and hence no far adjustment be need then we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp align the crosshairs with the central maximum of the lamp we chose the 300 line per mm a we have a stiff camera the 300 line per mm grate a oppose to the 80 would give few maximum but have them more spread out hence there be less chance of u slide past one without notice which would have make our data inaccurate however the down side be that there be few maximum to measure and hence the uncertainty in the wavelength we calculate be great moreover the slit be a narrow a possible so the width of each maximum be small reduce the uncertainty in the position of the maximum a each measurement would have an uncertainty which be half of the width of the beam finally use the eyepiece we observe the position a 𝜃 minus the angle at the central maximum on the vernier scale for each of the three wavelength purple blue and red each have a minimum of 4 measurable maximum with red have an extra 2 and blue have an extra 1. the first calculation be to find the wavelength of each of the emission line by plot 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 𝜆 which would give a straight line graph with a gradient of show the calculate wavelength and their uncertainty the error in the gradient be calculate use the standard error of the repeat we take for each wavelength and compute in python use a covariance matrix the error in the wavelength be due to the difficulty in locate where the center of each maximum be a the error be half of the width of the beam this be minimize by have the slit at it narrow set find the constant itself be a simple calculation use equation 2. this be within 0.28 of the expect value of 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 and have a very small error suggest our experimental procedure be accurate perhaps use the 80 line per mm grate would have yield a small error in the wavelength a there be more maximum to measure however due to the limitation of our stiff camera we could not do this however if we be to repeat the experiment we would choose a well spectrometer and make this adjustment perhaps get a value closer to the know one the aim of this experiment be to verify the remarkable relationship between photon emission and electron transition in hydrogen atom through the use of spectroscopy the experiment be indeed successful and the value we found be with 0.28 of the know value this be testament to the remarkably low error in spectrometer measurement and our own conscious effort to minimize error perhaps the only flaw be that we sacrifice have more maximum to measure by use the 300 line per mm grate a oppose to the 80 line per mm due to the limitation of our equipment if we be to repeat the experiment we would use a well function spectrometer and use the 80 line per mm grate to reduce the uncertainty in our value of wavelength perhaps a more technical extension would be to use apparatus which could detect the paschen and lyman emission series the lyman series emits ultraviolet photon a n=1 and the paschen series emits infrared radiation a n=3 then there would be 9 measurable wavelength of light and reduce the standard error 𝜎 √𝑛 a n would be nine hence the value would be even more accurate\"\n"," \"spectroscopy be commonly use a a non-invasive experimental technique for identify the composition of an object the aim for

saturnian model 1904 rutherford model 1911 and finally the rutherford-bohr model 1911 3 each succeed model improve on it predecessor by eliminate superfluous feature which do not agree with experimental result the success of bohr 's model lie in it ability to account for simple scenario such a a hydrogen atom and a constant which a of yet have no physical explanation the rydberg 's

level n 3 4 5 .... the secondary aim of the experiment be to test the resolve power of the grate spectrometer a well a to determine the chemical composition of the sun through examine the fraunhofer line and spectral line of certain salt in modern physic bohr 's model be supersede by the schrodinger equation which describes the orbit of electron around an atom in a purely mathematical formulation in 1885 johann balmer discover that an empirical equation could be use to account for the balmer series in a hydrogen atom his equation become know a the balmer equation which describes all the spectral line when electron from a high energy level drop down to the second energy level n 2 where b be a constant with the value of 364.50682nm and n be an integer great than 2. the four possible

start from the right 4 the equation be however purely localize to the principal quantum number of 2. it do not account for the lyman paschen brackett pfund humphreys and far series these series be later generalize by rydberg and explain by bohr 's model a see in figure 2. in 1888 johannes rydberg generalize the balmer equation for all transition of hydrogen 5 use four fundamental equation the four equation be where e be total energy ke kinetic energy and ep e electric potential energy of the electron collectively where f c be the centripetal force act on the electron in orbit due to the nucleus and f e be the electrical force act on the electron due to coulomb 's law where l be the angular momentum i the moment of inertia ω the angular frequency of the electron collectively and h planck 's constant a the electron can only occupy discrete energy state where c be the speed of light and e i and e f indicate the initial and final energy state of the electron respectively the derivation be a follow from equation 3a and common notion ke 1 2 mv 2 and ep e kze 2 r it can be show that where m be the mass of electron v the velocity of electron k coulomb 's constant z the atomic number e the charge of an electron and r the bohr radius distance between electron in the ground state and nucleus in a hydrogen atom from equation 3b and the common notion of circular motion and coulomb 's law it be obtain which reduces to the substitution of equation 6 into equation 4 be make from equation 3c and the common notion of i mr 2 and ω v r it be obtain the subject of the equation be then change to be v yield from here equation 9 be substitute into equation 6 yield which simplifies with r the subject into 11 equation 11 be then substitute into equation 7 yield finally equation 12 be substitute into equation 3d yield note the similarity to equation 1 which be when from here the theoretical value of the rydberg constant can be calculate with know value of h e k m 6 give r ∞

the grate that form a constructive interference be give by where d be the slit separation θ the angle from the zeroth order maximum and m the order of the maximum equation 14 then reduces to the minimum be give by which change to when there be contribution from n slit when there be two similar wavelength incident on the diffraction grate the intensity of the resultant emission spectrum form by the two wavelength will have peak very close to each other a show in figure 4. figure 4 the resultant emission spectrum form from light of two similar wavelength note the difference between ∆λ and ∆l which be difference in wavelength and resolve power respectively 7 if the difference in wavelength ∆λ be great than the resolve power ∆l of the grate a doublet would be see if ∆λ be small than ∆l than the grate spectrometer would fail to resolve the two peak for the purpose of the follow derivation it can be assume that resolve power ∆l equal difference in wavelength ∆λ light from the second wavelength be give by λ 2 λ 1 − ∆λ equation 14 and equation 17 be combine use λ 2 yield which reduces to equation 15 and equation 19 be then combine under λ λ 1 to form which together with definition λ 1 − λ 2 ∆λ yield from equation 21 it can be see that a the number of slit n on the grate decrease the resolution ∆λ increase hence the number of slit n remain at the point when the doublet disappears give the resolution ∆l and wavelength difference between the two light ∆λ classify a a g-type main-sequence star the sun be know to contain an abundance of hydrogen and helium 8 in the center where nuclear fusion occurs white light be produce and certain spectral be absorbed by chemical element present in the atmosphere of the sun figure 5 show the fraunhofer line associate with the sun by burning certain elemental salt in a candle flame and examine the light produce the composition of the sun can be analyse if an element produce the emission spectral line which match an absorption spectral line see in the fraunhofer line it can be conclude the sun contains say element for the purpose of this experiment it can be see that the atmosphere of the sun contains sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen the experimental set-up be divide into two phase calibration and data collection with reference to figure 6 the eyepiece crosswire camera lens be brought into focus on a distant object the telescope and collimator be then brought into alignment and the hydrogen lamp use a the source the focus of the spectrometer be then adjust until a sharp image of the zeroth order spectral line be visible next the telescope be move clockwise by 90 degree and a 78.8 line per mm grate place in the holder the grate table be turn and the height of the table adjust until the slit be again visible the grate be then rotate to be in alignment with the telescope and collimator thus conclude the calibration phase of the experiment for the rydberg constant experiment the order of the spectral line along with it colour be tabulate a a function of the reading on the vernier scale for the spectrometer resolution experiment a sodium lamp be place at the source and the telescope be direct at the small order where a doublet can be see a black piece of cardboard be slide from left to right between the grate and the object slowly until the doublet disappears at this point the ratio of the length of the grate cover up and the total length be estimate by eye for the fraunhofer line experiment a total of four salt be provide sodium chloride iron fill copper sulfate and magnesium oxide a candle be lit use a bunsen burner and the grate spectrometer point at the candle a ladle of the chosen salt be add into the flame and the color of the emission spectrum record and checked use the fraunhofer line show in figure 5. first it be note that all four spectral line h-alpha h-beta h-gamma and h-delta be see in the emission spectrum this be show in figure 7. the order of the balmer series a a function of the vernier scale reading be tabulate in table 1. set the zeroth order a the 0 degree a graph of sinθ against m for the red spectral line and blue spectral line be plot this be show in figure 8 and 9. from equation 15 it could be see that λ d slope since d 1 n 1 78.8mm 7 the value of λ could be derive from the slope of figure 8 and 9. this value of λ be then fed into equation 1 with the appropriate integer value of n 3 4 5 give an average value of r ∞ 10729936.11m −1 compare this with the establish literature value the relative difference be found to be small than 10 and therefore reliable the grate spectrometer resolution it be estimate that half of the total length of the slit be cover when the doublet disappear hence use equation 21 it be found that ∆λ 0.205nm where m 2 λ 2 589 × 10 −9 n 1 2 × 36mm × 80 line per mm the theoretical value for ∆λ be calculate from the follow ∆λ 589.6 − 589.0 0.6nm 24 although the experimental value be in the same order of magnitude a the theoretical value the relative difference be which be great than 10 and not reliable out of the four salt test iron filing and copper sulfate do not produce an emission spectrum sodium chloride produce yellow spectral line in correspondence to fraunhofer designation d and magnesium oxide produce red spectral line in correspondence to fraunhofer designation a a see in figure 5. qualitatively the experiment successfully capture the four spectral line h-alpha h-beta h-gamma and hdelta in the balmer series quantitatively the experiment determine the rydberg constant to a relative difference with the establish literature of 2 since the relative difference be small than 10 the experiment be consider consistent with theory these result be significant a they verify the emission spectral line associate with hydrogen which be commonly found in ionize interstellar hydrogen know a h ii region in astrophysics a nasa photograph of the orion nebula confirms this observation a show in figure 10. although the experimental value for resolution be determine to the same order of magnitude a the theoretical value the relative difference be large than 10 and hence be consider unreliable this inaccuracy of result could be due to an oversimplification in theory which do not account for how the spectrometer and it lens could contribute to an overall resolution this observation be back up by two fact firstly the theory predict that the pair of doublet in sodium lamp should merge into one when in fact one of the doublet simply disappear secondly both doublet disappear together when the source be a hydrogen lamp which should not happen accord to the theory this meant a more sophisticated theory accounting for the spectrometer 's contribution in resolution along with an increase care take during experiment would be necessary for future improvement figure 10 an astronomical photo of the orion nebula with easily identifiable h-alpha and h-delta spectral region locate in the center with h-beta and h-gamma region locate in the fringe 11 fraunhofer line refer to the fraunhofer line see in figure 5 it could be postulate that the solar composition contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen take an abridge table from a paper publish by the araa annual review of astronomy and astrophysics a see in figure 11 it could be see that the postulate be in fact correct figure 11 a breakdown of solar atmosphere composition show that the sun do contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen 12 iron filing do not produce a temperature a it melt point 1500 • c be great than the temperature of the candle 1400 • c although copper sulfate may have produce a green emission spectrum it be unclear whether if the result be due to a contamination of the candle flame hence the experimenter decide to err on the side of caution and discard the result for copper sulfate overall the experiment be consider consistent with theoretical prediction since the four spectral line predict by the theory be observe and rydberg constant be determine to a relative difference of 2 the result be consistent with theory for grate spectrometer resolution the discrepancy between the experimental resolution and theoretical resolution be too large 66 10 and hence a more careful treatment theoretically and experimentally would be warrant for fraunhofer line the result be consistent with the theory of araa which demonstrate that the sun 's atmosphere contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen hence the primary aim of the experiment be attain whilst the secondary aim obtain mixed success\"\n"," \"the rydberg constant allows one to predict how the atomic spectrum of various element should behave and the aim of this first year laboratory experiment be to calculate a value for the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer to take measurement on the diffraction pattern from a hydrogen gas lamp the first few transition wavelength for hydrogen 's balmer series be calculate to within ±0.6 of currently accepted high precision measurement 1 these transition wavelength be then use in conjunction with rydberg/bohr 's formula to calculate the rydberg constant a 1.094 ± 0.007

rydberg/bohr 's relation that accurately predicts the transition wavelength for hydrogen the aim of this first year laboratory experiment be to use a grate spectrometer to measure the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy the rydberg constant first arose in johannes rydberg 's pioneer work on the hydrogen spectrum but with no explanation for the physic behind what be be observe later in bohr 's model for the hydrogen atom a physical explanation be provide to derive the same relation which accurately model the energy transition between orbital level 2 spectrometer be important instrument use in the study of light spectrum from various source and be use extensively in multiple field across physic for example in astrophysics where a great deal of the research on the chemical composition of the universe utilizes spectrometer by use a spectrometer to measure the transition wavelength emit by a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp bohr's/rydberg 's model for the hydrogen transition wavelength can be use to deduce the rydberg constant since the spectrometer be capable of very accurate measurement it should be possible to achieve a value for r ∞ within 1 of the currently accepted value of 10 973 731.568 508 ± 0.000 065 m -1 3 bohr 's model hypothesize that the energy level in a hydrogen atom correspond to stable orbit that the electron can take around the nucleus and that the electron can only exist in one of these discrete orbit bohr argue that the angular momentum of the orbit electron be quantize and use classical mechanic mixed with the idea of quantize angular momentum he derive the follow equation that describes the total energy of the electron in the n th permit energy level/orbit where e n be the total energy in the n th orbit m be the electron mass e be the electron charge and h be planck 's constant by equate the difference between 2 energy level to the energy of a photon it can be show that the transition wavelength for hydrogen be give by where n

the 4 transition wavelength in the visible light spectrum belong to the balmer series 2 which be make up of the transition wavelength from n ≥ 3 and p 2. use a grate spectrometer it be possible to examine these spectral line and to calculate the transition wavelength from which r ∞ can be calculate use 2 calculate the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer a show in fig 1 collimate light ray arrive at the diffraction grate and be diffract by various angle θ produce an interference pattern the path difference between neighbor ray diffract by the same angle θ be dsin θ a highlight in fig 2. the correspond phase difference due to this path difference can be found by multiply the path difference by the magnitude of the wavevector where ∆φ be the phase difference d be the slit separation θ be the diffraction angle and λ be the wavelength of the light be diffract since constructive interference occurs when the phase difference be an integer multiple of 2π this give the follow relation describe the angle that the m th order maximum in the interference pattern will occur 5 where m be the order number from this relation the transition wavelength of hydrogen can be calculate by measure the diffraction angle over various order for each transition wavelength from here r ∞ can be calculate use these value for the hydrogen transition wavelength in order to prepare the spectrometer for take measurement the schematic show in fig 1 be first setup with the grate put to one side temporarily the grate and telescope be both mount separately such that the vernier scale on the spectrometer could be use to observe rotation of both the grate and of the telescope the vernier scale have increment of arcminute before take measurement there be a series of step take to ensure that the instrument be align and focus the eyepiece be focus on the crosshair and the camera lens be focus on a distant object such a the edge of a door that be approximately 15m awaythis be do to focus the camera a far away a possible since the light ray come from the grate be collimate the eyepiece be approach from various different angle and adjust accordingly to ensure that parallax between the image and crosshair be negligible the telescope be then align with the axis of the collimator and the slit width and collimator adjust such that a clear image of the slit be focus on the eyepiece use the clamp and the vernier scale the telescope be carefully rotate by 90.0 ± 0.1° and a diffraction grate of 2001 lines/inch be insert into the holder the grate be slowly rotate until the reflect image of the slit could be see in the eyepiece which indicate that the grate be now at 45° to the incident light ray the grate be then rotate back 45 ± 0.1° and lock into place such that it be accurately set at an angle normal to the incident light ray this be important since relation 5 assumes that the light ray be diffract approach the grate at normal incidence take these step ensure that the theory represent the physical scenario a accurately a possible since the grate ruling be not parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope the image form lay above the crosshair on the eyepiece the grate screw be adjust such that the image form on the eyepiece be in the middle of the crosshair and it be checked that the image form at large angle also form on the center of the crosshair once these step be conclude the spectrometer be set up such that the light ray from the hydrogen gas lamp would be collimate hit the diffraction grate at normal incidence and then focus onto the crosshair inside the telescope for view through the eyepiece in order to get a clear an image a possible of the balmer series spectral line the main light be switch off and desk lamp dim and the door be close such that

the central order 0 maximum which occur at the same location for all wavelength and this angle be record a a reference point give that each maximum have a finite width there be a random error associate with each measurement due to the fact that the crosshair be not necessarily focus exactly at the center of each maximum which be estimate to be ± 0.2° this value be obtain by examine how reproducible the measurement be for give spectral line and note that it be possible to reproduce measurement to this degree of certainty to reduce this source of random error 5 measurement be take for every angle measurement such that a mean and standard error on the mean could be obtain the maximum for each transition wavelength be then measure at various order either side of the central maximum

translate into the correspond error on sin θ for each transition wavelength the value of θ be use to plot sin θ against m see fig 4. in fig 4 a predict use 5 the data for each transition wavelength yield a linear relationship between sin θ and the order of maximum use a least square linear fitting a compute value for the gradient of each linear fit be obtain with the gradient correspond to λ/d from 5 use a covariance matrix which take into account the error on each individual data point it be possible to also obtain an error on the output gradient from here the value of the gradient and associate error be use to compute value for each transition wavelengthsee table 1. the value for slit separation be obtain from the grate period give on the diffraction grate the grate period be 2001 lines/inch and a small estimate uncertainty of ± 5 lines/inch be add to take into account any discrepancy between the quote period and the actual period this give u a value for the slit separation of 12.69 ± 0.01μm the fractional error for the slit separation and the gradient value be add in quadrature to obtain an error for the value of each wavelength the least accurate measurement be for the n=5 transition wavelength which have an error of 0.6 in comparison to recent high precision measurement for these wavelength 1 in order to calculate r ∞ fig 5 be plot use these compute value for the transition wavelength and their associate uncertainty a show in fig 5 the data follow a linear relationship with the gradient correspond to r ∞ a be expect from 2 from a least square linear fitting that be use a value for the gradient and thus r ∞ output be calculate of 1.094 ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 with a discrepancy of 0.3 between the calculate value for r ∞ and the currently accepted value 3 there be a high level of accuracy on the calculate value for r ∞ however the final uncertainty for the value for r ∞ come out at ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 which be equal to ± 0.64 the main contribute factor to this value for the uncertainty be the finite width of each maximum observe despite appear to the human eye at the center of the crosshair each time a measurement be make the reading on the vernier scale would still vary by ± 0.2° it be attempt to reduce the effect of this random error by take 5 measurement for each maximum however this be still a relatively small sample size be the experiment to be attempt again take a large sample size for each maximum such a 20 measurement would reduce the effect of the random error and would also reduce the standard error on the mean for each value give a small uncertainty on r ∞ fig 4. sin θ plot a a function of order of maximum θ be the angle at which the m th maximum occurs mean value plot for sin θ with the overlaid linear fit be obtain use a least square linear regression error bar calculate use 6 currently accepted value have be obtain from 1 a paper present data on the spectral line from hydrogen obtain use high precision laser spectroscopy another way to reduce the uncertainty and obtain a more accurate value would be to observe more hydrogen transition wavelength the linear fitting show in fig 5 only have three data point which corresponds to a large uncertainty on the output gradient use a more powerful hydrogen gas discharge tube that produce a more intense beam and by eliminate the small source of background light such a desk lamp it should be possible to observe the n=6 hydrogen transition wavelength which do lie within the visible spectrum a 410.2 nm 1 with more data point to consider the linear fitting would output a more accurate value for r ∞ a well a a small uncertainty a key factor that affected the accuracy of the final value of r ∞ be the value for slit separation use the grate use have a period of 2001 lines/inch with an estimate error of ± 5 lines/inch since the slit separation be a constant that be directly use to obtain the wavelength value and their error a repeat of the experiment could involve an investigation into the accuracy and uncertainty of this value since this could yield more accurate value for each transition wavelength and thus a more accurate value for r ∞ lastly source of random error such a background source of light in the spectroscopy room and random error due to the finite thickness of each maximum reduce the accuracy of the final result have a more powerful telescope on the spectrometer couple with a more powerful hydrogen gas lamp would allow the slit width to be reduce whilst still be able to resolve the spectral line this would reduce the random error due to the finite thickness of each spectral line and this also could make it possible to resolve the n=6 transition wavelength which would increase the accuracy on the value for r ∞ the main aim of the experiment be to accurately measure the first few wavelength of the hydrogen balmer series and use these to calculate r ∞ and a correspond uncertainty use a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp angle at which maximum of intensity occur for the n 3 4 5 transition wavelength be measure and knowledge about diffraction and interference pattern be use to calculate the correspond transition wavelength of light it be then possible to verify the relationship that bohr and rydberg have both postulate between the transition wavelength and the correspond difference in energy level relation 2 accurately described the data that be observe with the predict relationship clearly be observe in fig 5. a value for r ∞ be obtain of 1.094 ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 that lay within 0.3 of the currently accepted value which be a key success another key success be that through the careful track of uncertainty and their propagation throughout the calculation a realistic degree of uncertainty be achieve for each wavelength with the currently accepted value for each wavelength a show in table 1 fall within the bound of the quote uncertainty to improve the experiment it be conclude that have total control the environment that the experiment be carry out in would be beneficial such that all source of background light could be eradicate with that achieve there could be a chance of resolve the n=6 transition wavelength which would increase the quality of the linear fitting in fig 5 and thus lead to a more accurate value for r ∞ with a small uncertainty also with more time available large sample size for each data point would help to reduce the impact of the random error that occurs since the standard error on the mean reduces by a rate 1/√n n be the number of measurement take it be also conclude that the accuracy on the value for the transition wavelength and thus r ∞ will always be limited by the accuracy of the grate period so a repeat of the experiment should also include an investigation into the accuracy of the specify grate period such that a more accurate value for the slit separation and it 's uncertainty can be obtain the laboratory session serve a a demonstration of the level of accuracy that can be achieve by a spectrometer and by take a sample of measurement with careful consideration of uncertainty and error it be possible to achieve measurement of nanometer level precision use such an instrument\"]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3.
