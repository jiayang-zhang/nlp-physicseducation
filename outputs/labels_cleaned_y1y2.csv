1,GS_VJL711_Redacted,where z be the atom 's atomic number 𝜀 0 be the vacuum permittivity me be the electron 's mass and e be the charge of the electron if we divide eq 2.2 by eq 2 2.6 where v and t be potential the kinetic energy of electron respectively 5 since the energy of a photon emit by a hydrogen atom be give by the difference of two hydrogen energy level where n and m be positive integer and n be great than m. from the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a photon 𝜈 𝑐 𝜆 2.9 where c be the speed of light eq 6 can be rewrite a for hydrogen atom the atomic number z be 1. therefore the rydberg constant be define a in this experiment we experimentally measure the rydberg constant if hydrogen gas be heat or electrically charge the electron in the atom be excite and the add energy push the electron to high energy orbitals when the electron fall back to their original position the add energy be re-emitted in the form of photon and the wavelength of the photon be determine by the differnece in energy between the orbitals a show in where m can be call the order number we set up the spectrometer a show in fig 3.1 use a collimator a grate and a camera with a crosshair and ensure that they be in parallel the beam of photon from the light source be diffract by the grate so we set the angular position of the camera when they be parallel a an origin and rotate it until a light fringe be observe then we measure the angle of diffraction by measure the change in angle from the origin use a vernier we repeat this with a many other fringe a possible and statisticised the result to find the rydberg constant although the rydberg constant obtain from the experiment be reasonably close to the theoretical value the uncertainty of the constant be unacceptably huge and we found that there be various reason that affected our value since the room be dark and it be hard to read the cramped number on the veriner the angle of diffraction could be measure imprecisely we conclude that this be the major factor that affected the inaccurate rydberg constant we found that the major uncertainty emerge in consequence of the wide slit size since this cause the thicker width of the light fringe this could be improve by use a narrow slit there could be various systematic error that affected the result we try to perfectly align the spectrometer but this could be unsuccessful also the position of the lamp should have be a close to the slit a possible since it be directly related to the intensity of the light this could make u see the cyan colour light the air pressure and humidity be also other source but we decide that they be negligible there be background light which be inevitably require to measure the angle of diffraction we thought this could be the reason why the cyan colour of light and the 3 rd order light fringe of red and violet light be not detect and test without any light but we still could not see the line in the experiment we try to measure the rydberg constant use a hydrogen gas tube and a spectrometer and we get 𝑅 ∞ 10.5 × 10 6 ± 4.4 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 which be only 0.4 unit less than the theoretical value however we fail to obtain the precise value a our uncertainty be over 40 percent of our value and we conclude that the width of the slit be not narrow enough to produce the precise result this could be improve by repeat the experiment in a darker room with a narrower slit width and a clearer vernier a for reference this be the code that have be use for data analysis,extended,bal
2,GS_GXI055_Redacted,he aim of this experiment be to determine a value for the wavelength of the emission spectrum of several different compound this be do by burning the compound use initially a candle but later on a butane blowtorch to excite the electron to a high energy shell which lead to them lose their energy in the form of a photon a they transition back down to a low energy state the wavelength of this light be measure use a grate spectrometer the two compound that we will be use be licl and cuso 4 these compound be not the only one that we attempt to determine the wavelength of however we could not excite the electron with either the blowtorch or the candle so we do not find a value for the wavelength of these compound the grate will measure the angle between the different slit of light from the emission spectrum the experiment rest upon the idea that a diffraction grate will turn a beam of light of the same wavelength into several maximum and minimum due to interference of the light wave from this and the knowledge of distance between the grate we can calculate the wavelength of the slit from which we can calculate which transition between orbitals the light represent when a compound be heat the electron within the atom of that compound be excite meaning they now have more energy consequently they will transition from a low energy orbital to one of high energy 3 the energy that the electron have absorbed be exactly equal to the energy of the high orbital minus the energy of the low orbital eventually the electron de-excite meaning that they transition back to a low energy orbital they then release the excess energy a a photon of light with a wavelength 𝜆 correspond to that energy this be express in equation 2.1 a well a be show in figure 1. where h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light in m/s the energy of the high energy orbital and the low energy orbital be specific to the compound meaning that specific wavelength will be observe from the emission spectrum of different compound the diffraction grate be make up of a large number of narrow slit that be equally space it have n slit with a slit separation d 5 a maximum will occur when the phase difference between two adjacent ray be 2𝜋𝑚 with m be determine wavelength of emission spectrum use a grate spectrometer t an integer represent the order of the slit consequently we have equation 2.2. a path difference be equal to 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 where 𝜃 be the angle between the central maximum and the maximum we be measure we arrive at equation 2.3. 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 𝑚𝜆 2.3 this equation allows u to relate the angle of the maximum to the wavelength of the emission spectrum the maximum and minimum be show in figure 2 6 the maximum number of order produce be found when we take 𝜃 𝜋 2 this be because the large diffraction angle that we can have from a grate that be perpendicular to the light ray be use si for all unit we set up the equipment a show in figure 3. we have a choice of several diffraction grate with different quantity of line per mm we decide to use the low line per mm diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm this be because this grate will produce the slit a close a we can get them this be because for this grate d be the high value if we look at equation 2.3 we can see that this will give u a small value of 𝜃 for a give value of m. equation 2.4 show u that for this big value of d we will have a large number of order m that will be visible the light come from the burning compound it then pas through the narrow slit after which it be make parallel by the collimate lens the parallel light then hit the grate at normal incidence where it be diffract this light be then focus by the camera lens onto the crosshair at the point x. the eyepiece can be use to view the magnify image we make sure to adjust the slit and the end of the collimator to ensure that all of the diffraction slit be thin meaning that it be easy to determine their angle from the central fringe this also help ensure that the excess light not from the compound be more easily distinguishable from the fringe we decide not to take too much time make sure the central fringe be at 0 degree instead we take the value that the central fringe be at and then subtract this from all of the measurement to essentially make this the zero point this method be just a precise a calibrate the spectrometer to 0 degree this be do in order to save time so that we could take more measurement this process be show in appendix a and b. measurement be take by look through the eyepiece and line up the lens to align with one of the slit we then use the protractor attach to the side of the spectrometer to measure the angle that the lens be at this be then repeat for all of the slit that be visible to u in order for the slit to be easily distinguish we do the experiment in almost complete darkness in order to produce the emission spectrum that we need to carry out the experiment we have to burn the compound we be initially instruct to use a candle to burn the compound and produce the light when this method be try however we encounter a few problem the first be that the candle flame do n't appear to be hot enough 8 to produce the number of photon need to make the measurement the second problem be if any photon be be produce they be not noticeable due to the large amount of light produce from the candle itself to alleviate this issue we decide to use a butane blowtorch a it be much hotter than a candle flame 9 a well a the flame be less bright in order to use the blowtorch we place the compound into a metal bowl with some candle wax inside the wax be there a we found that the compound burn much brighter when they be mixed with the wax make it easy to carry out our experiment we then aim the torch downwards towards the compound a it be turn on this produce lot of colour light which we be able to analyse through the eyepiece these measurement have to be take relatively quickly a we found that if the compound burn for too long the candle wax would start to boil spit at u therefore make it unsafe to work the data that we gather from the method be summarise in table 1 and table 2. we observe the light from the licl to be red and the light from the cuso 4 to be green this be all do in python for this reason we take the sine of all the value we have record then plot this data against m on a graph a be show in figure 4 and 5. the error bar be a combination of the error due to the equipment add to the error due to the width of the slit meaning the angle measurement have a range these error be add in quadrature for fig 4 we have a gradient of 0.05637. this be calculate in python by use the polyfit function that be part of the scipy package use the covariance matrix in python we calculate that the uncertainty in the graph be ±0.0005044 this uncertainty be very small in relation to the value for the gradient this be because the point on the graph all give a very similar value for wavelength so they all line up on the graph use equation 4.1 we can see that in order to find the wavelength we multiply the value for the gradient by the distance in between each line on the grate a the grate have 78.8 line per mm we calculate that the distance between each slit be 0.0000127m we can multiply this by the gradient to find that the wavelength for photon emit from licl to be 6.82 × 10 −7 ± 8 × 10 −9 m. it be obvious that the error in cuso 4 be big than the error in licl this be partially due to have less data point for the cuso 4 than the licl this be because the after the 1 st order maximum the 2 nd order maximum be too faint to be distinguish from the background light which be mainly be produce by the blowtorch from do this experiment we notice several area for improvement both the candle and the blowtorch both give wide spectrum from their own light consequently the slit of light be much less well define meaning that it be much more difficult to measure the angle another issue be that due to have to use a small aluminium container with wax in it meant we could only burn the compound for a short amount of time after a short duration of the blow torch be on the container would start to melt this be due to the melt point of aluminium be low than the temperature of the torch 10 the setup we use also meant that the light tend to flicker a we be heating the compound this also make it far more difficult to take precise measurement in order to solve all of these problem if we be to repeat the experiment we would use the follow setup to heat the compound a bunsen burner would be setup and set to a blue flame a metal scalpel would be use to scoop up the compound and place it into the flame release photon this mean we would only have to stop each measurement when all of the compound be burn this be a definite improvement a we would have a consistent way to burn the compound get rid of some of the flicker that we previously experienced it will also mean that we would have longer to take our measurement for the angle meaning that our value will likely be more accurate a we will not have to rush in conclusion the value of the wavelength for photon emit from licl be 𝜆 682 × 10 −7 ± 800 × 10 −7 m the value for the wavelength of the photon emit from cuso 4 be 𝜆 5.43 × 10 −7 ± 4.5 × 10 −8 m neither of the value for the wavelength that we have determine through our experiment agree with the accepted value for wavelength of the photon emit from the compound there be a percentage difference of 3 for licl and 11 for cuso 4 from the accepted value in order to gain more accurate value for the wavelength we would repeat the experiment again make the change that i suggest in part v of this report,extended,the
3,GS_NGT657_Redacted,the rydberg constant be one of the most important constant in atomic physic due to it relation to other fundamental constant and because of the high level of accuracy to which it be possible to determine it value this experiment aim to use a grate spectrometer to accurately measure this constant by observe the emission spectrum produce by a hydrogen discharge lamp and measure the diffraction angle of the different spectral line use these to calculate their wavelength and then rydberg 's constant use the rydberg formula the value achieve by this method be 11030000 m -1 with an uncertainty of ± 4000 m -1 this place the result 14 σ away from the accepted value of 10973731 m -1 hen excite to high energy state all atom produce emission spectrum due to the transition of the atom 's electron from high to low energy level emit energetic photon a they do so these spectrum be unique to every element in accordance with the unique energy level available to the electron for occupation 1 study these spectral line have have an impact on a wide range of area in physic observe their position allows u to measure the distance and relative velocity of distant galaxy or the elemental composition of star 2 develop both the theoretical understand of these spectrum and the method to measure them then have be instrumental in progress scientific theory and knowledge of our universe central to this theoretical appreciation of atomic spectrum be the rydberg constant this constant describes the wavelength of light in the atomic spectrum relate them to the transition of electron result in the photon 's emission although discover by balmer and rydberg empirically it be the theoretical work by bohr which follow that give rydberg 's constant it real significance bohr prove that the constant be in fact a fundamental one by express it in term of other atomic fundamental see the next section -theory 3 amongst these constant be the fine structure constant α. this relation have lead to the rydberg constant have great importance in the field of quantum electrodynamics or qed the fine structure constant be central to qed a it be a measure of the electromagnetic couple strength at low energy 4 the rydberg constant can be determine with an extremely high level of accuracy 3 and a such enables great calculation of other fundamental constant especially in this case α. calculate constant to high degree of accuracy be often the best test for theory a have be the case for qed and allows much great theoretical prediction a such due to progress make measure rydberg 's constant qed be often consider the most accurate theory in modern science 5 this experiment aim to determine the value of rydberg 's constant use grate spectroscopic method the setup result and error analysis be all present a well a a critical analysis of the method and potential improvement a grate can be consider a large number of small equally space slit with a separation d. light passing through a grate form a diffraction pattern of maximum if the wavelength of the light be λ maximum occur where the phase difference between light wave come from the different slit be an integer m of 2π at this point the wave be in phase at the same relative position in their oscillatory cycle and constructive interference occurs in other word the light wave sum to produce brighter patch the path difference between two wave be the physical difference in distance that the wave have travel and be give by dsinθ a show in figure 1 where θ be the angle the light make with the grate the phase difference can be define in term of the path difference a therefore by substitute the requirement for the phase difference and the result found for the path difference and hence this be know a the grate equation unlike with simple two slit interference pattern the great number of slit in a grate mean that the maximum be much more distinct and separate by large area of darkness at all point other than determine rydberg 's constant by observe the emission spectrum of a hydrogen discharge lamp use a grate spectrometer w 3 the collimator be then focus so that a clear image be visible on the cross hair of the eyepiece in the telescope a minimum slit width be use to make sure the focus be good a large beam have less define edge make identify the point of focus more difficult the telescope be line up with the beam accurately use the fine motion knob the value read on the vernier scale at this position be record a this be the zero position about which other measurement be reference the telescope be then rotate exactly 90° measure use the vernier scale before place a grate of 80 line mm -1 in the holder the grate table be rotate so that a reflect image of the light beam be visible and align in the telescopeindicating a rotation of the grate of exactly 45° use the scale the grate be then rotate 45° these step ensure the grate be accurately set at an angle of 0° or normal to the collimator the sodium lamp be swap for the hydrogen lamp be use to take measurement the lamp be place a close to the slit at the end of the collimator a possible to reduce the amount of background light enter the system a possible the experiment be conduct in a dark laboratory however the lamp of colleague could still provide external light which have the potential to interfere with the diffraction pattern and the spectrum observe it be decide that both student would take measurement of the position of the maximum a this would help identify the human difference in reading the vernier scale and account for them in a statistical error four set of reading be take in total the telescope be move around the grate bed align with the spectral line accurately use the fine motion knob on the bed and the angle be read off the vernier scale in order to calculate the value of θ a label in figure 2 the zero position reading be subtract from the reading on the scale at the position of the line the angular position be record a a function of order for each of the three different colour spectral line visible red blue and violet because hydrogen lamp overheat and reduce in efficiency after extend use the discharge lamp be turn on whilst the telescope be move into position and secure and then turn off whilst the reading be take from the vernier scale this prevent the lamp from overheat and have to wait for it to cool there be some difficulty in accurately align the telescope with the centre of the high order maximum due to how faint they be in order to try and overcome this shield be use to block out a much background light a possible from the entire setup to provide a great contrast between the spectral line and the dark background reduce the error repeat the reading also aim to reduce the effect of this error in the case of the violet line the third order maximum be not always possible to see the experiment be complete over two week and during the first session the negative third order be not visible and in the second session the positive third order be not visible this be despite all condition and equipment be maintain a similar a possible this do mean that some data be collect for both positive and negative high order however only two reading be make rather than the four achieve for the rest of the colour and order before take result the slit width on the collimator be adjust so that high order maximum in the diffraction pattern be visible by widen the slit and allow more light to pa through however the slit could not be so wide that the beam be too large and undefined a this would add uncertainty to the measurement of their position at this point the diffraction grate be change from 80 line per mm to 300 line per mm a by consider equation 3 it be clear that a small gap between line a small value of d lead to a large angle between order a both m and λ remain constant the effect of this be to reduce the relative error in the measurement of the position the graph below show the average of the data collect for each colour line at each order where negative order and angle correspond to those in the direction define previously the error bar include on the plot have be calculate use the range of the data discussion of why this method be chosen follow later the error bar prove so small they be unclear on figure 3 so an example point be show in figure 4. linear trend line have be calculate use the least square method weight by the inverse of the error of each data point and plot on the graph a can be see from 3 the gradient of a line be 𝜆 𝑑 where d be know to be 3.33 × 10 −6 therefore the wavelength correspond to the light form the three different spectral line can be found these be found to be 653nm for red 483nm for blue and 432nm for the violet line use external resource 7 these wavelength be related to the electron transition produce these photon so the value of n in equation 4 be know the value of p be know to be 2 a this defines the balmer series therefore substitute in the related value of λ and n provide three value of the rydberg constant the mean average of these be take to produce the final result of 11030000 m -1 figure 3 -the sine of the angle to different order diffraction maximum for the red blue and violet spectral line from 3 the gradient of the line be 𝜆 𝑑 and the wavelength of the spectral line be found to be 653nm 483nm and 432nm respectively order e.g +1 and -1 +2 and -2 etc and checked that they be exactly the same a they should be if the grate be perfectly orthogonal to the incident light despite the angle in the result be similar they could have be even more accurate and this may have reduce the inaccuracy of the experiment there be other factor in the laboratory that be uncontrollable and would have have an effect on the accuracy of the experiment the air condition such a pressure temperature and importantly how they vary be not strictly control beyond the fact that the experiment be complete in the same lab for the two session vary pressure and temperature result in a change refractive index of the air which affect the path of the light travel through it and would change the angle record 8 although this effect be consider to be too small to have a significant effect during the practical procedure if the setup could be modify to be conduct in a vacuum any potential effect from the air would be remove,deep,bal
4,GS_HHM124_Redacted,in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the apparatus be already assemble my lab partner and i only have to do the calibration the diffraction grate in the experiment have 300 line per millimeter by analyze the data for interference line of each colour separately one can find it wavelength by relate the found wavelength to the appropriate change in energy level it be possible to find the rydberg constant use this method it be found that the value of the constant be 1.099 × 10 7 ± 2 × 10 4 𝑚 −1 the only great problem in this experiment be that there be probably light come from an outside source which we fail to distinguish from the hydrogen spectrum when measurement be take the main aim of this experiment be to obtain the rydberg constant while also learn how to use a grate spectrometer with the use of a spectrometer one can study the spectrum of light 1 this allows u to thereby deduce some property of luminous object or substance a grate spectrometer disperses light with a grate in which the slit be equally separate this produce an interference pattern which depends on the wavelength of the disperse light and on the distance between the several slit in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the observe interference pattern allow u to deduce the wavelength of photon which be produce by different transition between energy level in the hydrogen atom by relate the wavelength to the appropriate transition one can derive the rydberg constant and it uncertainty the grate be make of many slit which create an interference pattern for light of wavelength  the constructive interference will occur at 1 where 𝛩 be the angle at which the interference line be observe d be the distance between the slit and m be the order number an integer by find several angle at which interference occurs we can therefore accurately find also the wavelength of light furthermore the mention wavelength depends on the energy of the photon which be also the energy release by an atom make a transition from one energy level to another the wavelength be related to the transition between energy level by the rydberg equation 1 where r ∞ be rydberg 's constant n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level in our experiment we could only observe visible light which be part of the balmer series the balmer series be know to be create when atom drop down to the second energy level from any high energy level 1 hence we know that p will always be 2 for our case the n related to each wavelength will be guess by use our previous knowledge of how the colour of observe light be connect to the energy carry by photon by use 1 to find the wavelength and then substitute them into 2 while make reasonable guess of n we can therefore derive the rydberg constant the grate spectrometer we use consists of a collimator a table with a grate holder a camera and an eyepiece although we be give a function grate spectrometer my lab partner and i have to calibrate the instrument during calibration we use a sodium lamp a the light source since the hydrogen lamp overheats quickly we focus the eyepiece at a convenient view distance to minimize eye strain both my lab partner and i have to agree on the calibration since we want to take measurement independently crosschecking our data and thereby make sure that we do not make a mistake while reading the angle on the scale or align interference line with the cross wire in the eyepiece then we have to focus the camera lens on a point far away since the light from our source be collimate similar to light from a distant object this be do by point the camera across the room the object that we point it at be approximately 15 meter away and focus it in such a way that there be no parallax between the see image and the cross wire the camera have to point directly at the collimator to achieve this the camera be rotate by 90 degree so that it be at a right angle with respect to the collimator a mirror be place in the holder for the grate slight adjustment be make to position of the mirror until the reflect light be align with the cross wire this meant that the mirror be form an angle of 45 degree with both the collimator orientation and the camera orientation by rotate the camera back by 90 degree and the table with the holder by 45 degree the camera be point directly at the collimator and the grate would be perpendicular to their orientation the mention part be then clamped into position we also have to set the right height of the grate by take a quick look at the interference line we notice that the one at great angle be dimmer and be above the centre of the cross wire we use three screw in the table to adjust the height and orientation the table could be tilt because there be three screw so that the grate be not tilt and we could clearly see all the interference line when the setup be complete the sodium lamp be replace with the hydrogen lamp and we start take measurement a grate with 300 slit per mm be use in table 1 we can see all the interference line at what angle they occur and their colour we initially estimate the error for each measurement base on the difference between our record and the width of the interference line which be approximately 2 arcminute most of the error be in the range of 3 to 6 arcminute however there be some measurement be the uncertainty range do not cover the same value a the measurement on the opposite side with the opposite order number since this indicate that the error estimation have to be too small i decide to increase the error associate with the two measurement these error get large than i hop but fortunately there be at least three measurement for each colour that be quite accurate because the wavelength be calculate from the slope of the graph the error of the wavelength be not too large since the accurate measurement determine the slope to a great extent the wavelength of each colour be determine by plot a sin θ versus order number m. the error of sin θ be obtain by use the fact that at first i plot the sin θ versus order number line for all the colour on the same graph in python fig 2 but i also want to find the uncertainty of each slope since this be rather inconvenient in python i decide to use logger pro to find the minimum and maximum slope this method be show in appendix a. from 1 we can deduce that where k be the slope of the graph for one of the colour 𝜆 be the wavelength of light of that colour and d the distance between two slit the diffraction grate use in our experiment have 300 slit per millimeter with no uncertainty state i estimate it to be 0.5 of a slit per millimeter since otherwise the grate would have a different slit per unit length number state on it 2 we can see that all the wavelength match the true value except the wavelength for green light do not but there be a slight deviation of the mean value this might be due to systematic error most noticeable be the fact that the central line be not at exactly 0 degree but at 3 arcminute this indicates that the diffraction grate be not perfectly perpendicular although the angle by which it be deviate be small this could have cause a great change in the angle at which the interference pattern occur the green colour be not even close to any of the wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum and there be also quite large deviation of the data point from the best fit line most likely cause for it occurrence be that there be another element with hydrogen in the same lamp or that it occur because of another light source i be more inclined towards the latter explanation because it also explains why the uncertainty be so large if light be not come perpendicular to the grate the pattern will not be described perfectly by 1 from the wavelength obtain in table 2 it be possible to calculate the rydberg constant since it be already explain that the green colour wavelength do not match any of the value from literature it will not be use to obtain rydberg 's constant the other three wavelength will be use and we can expect to obtain very accurate value since the wavelength be also found to be accurate the final energy level in each case be 2 since all the emission line be part of the balmer series furthermore the initial energy level for each wavelength will be guess base on the fact that the energy of a photon be inverse proportional to the wavelength for example red light have the large wavelength hence it be produce by the low energy transition where the initial energy state be 3. blue light have slightly more energy hence the initial state be 4 and in the case of purple light the initial energy state be 5. equation 2 can be rearrange to obtain the rydberg constant i decide to write down the value for the constant to 9 significant figure since they will be use together to get the final result by take the average of the three value for each colour we obtain the follow result 𝑅 ∞ 10986233.4 ± 17863.9 𝑚 −1 ≅ 1.099 × 10 7 ± 2 × 10 4 𝑚 −1 6 the value of the constant found in literature be 𝑅 ∞ 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 2 the obtain value for the rydberg constant have the value from literature include in it uncertainty range we can conclude that the experimental procedure be appropriate and the error estimation be reasonable the aim of this experiment be to obtain the value of rydberg 's constant the experimental procedure be quite good because we have obtain an accurate value for the constant but there be still some possibility for improvement we should have definitely checked that we have observe the right colour since it turn out that one of the observe one be not come from hydrogen this be not a huge problem since the constant could still be derive from other colour furthermore we could have also minimize other error we could have repeat the calibration until the central interference line would be at exactly 0 degree because probably then we would have also see small difference between the measurement on opposite side the error on the distance between two slit be also probably an overestimation one way to low it would be two use light with know wavelength find it interference patter and calculate the distance between two slit with the associate uncertainty the great strength of the data analysis for this experiment in my opinion be use the sine of angle versus order number graph because it really help to low the uncertainty in the slope and consequently in the rydberg constant appendix a estimate the uncertainty of slope although the determination of uncertainty of slope be of central importance i decide to put in into in the appendix because it take a large amount of space logger pro be use to determine the uncertainty in slope at first all the data point with uncertainty be plot by use the `` model `` function under the `` analyze `` tab i be able to create an arbitrary best fit line and change it slope to see what be the great and low slope that could be plot through the error bar,expert,bal
5,GS_BSS023_Redacted,"the aim of this experiment be to provide a calculation for rydberg 's constant by use the emission line of hydrogen by observe red and aqua emission line the expect transition level for each and use the spectrometer equation we be able to obtain two very close value for rydberg 's constant and establish a final value and uncertainty for the red emission line we obtain a value of 𝟏𝟎 𝟕𝟕𝟐𝟏𝟑𝟒 ± 𝟎 𝟎𝟐𝟗𝟗𝟒𝟎 × 𝟏𝟎 𝟔 𝒎 −𝟏 and for the aqua emission line we obtain 𝟏𝟎 𝟕𝟗𝟒𝟐𝟖𝟎 ± 𝟎 𝟎𝟐𝟑𝟕𝟏𝟗 × 𝟏𝟎 𝟔 𝒎 −𝟏 .the percentage error be 0.28 and 0.22 respectively though neither value be within 𝝈 of the generally-accepted value for 𝑹 ∞ i. ascertain the elemental makeup of object be an important task in both research and industrial application thus if we be able to determine this composition by the emission or absorption spectrum of object we would have a non-invasive technique to determine their makeup rydberg 's constant enables u to make prediction a to the constituent element of object base just on their emission spectrum and it value be therefore an important experimental quantity to be determine calculate rydberg 's constant enables u to reliably determine the expect emission spectrum of different material and hence employ physical method in order to nondestructively determine the chemical composition of different compound we can also employ such technique to successfully determine the composition of otherwiseinaccessible object such a star 2 in order to determine rydberg 's constant 𝑅 ∞ we use a grate spectrometer first we experimentally determine the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission line use the grate equation we then experimentally determine the value of 𝑅 ∞ an atom be compose of a nucleus and an electronic shell depend on the element the atom can have multiple layer on it electronic shell each with a quantize energy level this mean that electron can not occupy energy state in between those level however when an atom be excite i.e when energy be impart upon it it electron can gain enough energy to transition to a level farther away from the nucleus afterward they will transition back to their original energy level and in the process release a photon of energy level equivalent to the energy difference energy gap between the electron 's transition level these emit photon constitute the atom 's emission spectrum we use rydberg 's constant to predict what sort of photon i.e predict their wavelength and energy a certain element 's spectrum will consist of 2 the grate spectrometer u a grate with 𝑁 slit to disperse incident light the light which pas through the grate will be deflect at an angle 𝜃 and will suffer from constructive and destructive interference due to their change in phase which will in turn create a certain interference pattern accord to theory this interference pattern will roughly resemble a succession of peak and valley the phase difference between neighbour ray be give by 1 the valley of the pattern correspond to the minimum of interference which occur for 𝑁 slit when the peak of this interference pattern correspond to the maximum of interference which occur when the phase difference be an integer multiple of 2n 1 c/ 2nm 2nm 2 dsin 0 5 accord to theoretical expectation we would expect any transition photon to obey the relation 6 where n and p be the number of the initial and final energy state of the atom equation 6 allows u to obtain an experimental value for rex give that we know the other quantity for our experiment p 2 in all case while n 3 for red light and n 4 for aqua light 4 in order to obtain j we can use the grate equation 1 where j be the w avelength of the spectral line d be the distance between two slit in our diffraction grate e be the angle at which an interference maximum occurs and m be the correspond order number the order number be an integer quantity and for the i th line of a specific colour observe after rotate the grate clockwise or anti-clockwise from the define start position i m thus m can take both negative and positive value accord to equation 7 if we plot sin 0 a a function of m we should obtain a linear plot from whose gradient we can extract j and calculate it associate error namely the gradient from we then use the covariance matrix our number of sample be large enough to use this method to find the uncertainty of this parameter r which we will call ay thus we obtain -from which we find 11 from equation 6 we find from this w e find the uncertainty in our value for r 00 our final result will be in the form before perform the experiment we have to calibrate the spectrometer so a to achieve a good resolution define a the resolve power at which both my lab partner and i be able to easily observe two give set of spectral emission line the process be perform use a sodium lamp since it do not run the risk of burning out and consist of the diffraction grate we use have 77.8 slit per millimetre and we found it to be best in achieve a good resolution in the spectrometer the actual experiment be do use a hydrogen lamp which allow u to observe hydrogen 's spectral emission line for increase accuracy the device use to measure the angle include a vernier scale so we be able to measure our result with ½ arcminute precision after establish the 0 𝑡ℎ order number we rotate the optical device clockwise and anticlockwise record the angle of diffraction and the order number we then process the data computationally create a line of best fit between the order number and the sine of the diffraction angle our experimental result confirm the expectation of the linear relationship between the order number and the sine of the angle at which interference maximum occur a be evident from the figure below however when plot the residual obtain when we subtract the expect value from the real value a nonlinear trend be observe which point to systematic error occur in our experimental setup therefore for the red and aqua maximum we obtain the percentage error on these value be 0.28 and 0.22 for red and aqua respectively which implies high statistical accuracy derive from the large sample base and low overall random error the random error which do exist be likely due to not reading the middle of the emission line accurately statistical error could be even far reduce by systematically building an even large database of measurement nevertheless our experimental range do not coincide or include the expect theoretical value for rydberg 's constant 3 𝑅 ∞ 10,973,731.6 𝑚 −1 10.9737316 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 this be likely due to systematic error affect the experiment some source of systematic error likely include misalignment of the optical piece tiny difference in air pressure and temperature cause slight change in the behaviour of the space through which light pas thereby introduce small error in our reading improve the experiment would require more stringent condition for perform it firstly the room in which the experiment be perform be not dark and might have cause u to miss some of the maximum associate with high order number a these be less visible when parasitic light upset the experimental setup moreover repeat the experiment several time would help improve confidence in the result an improve setup and procedure would be instead of use a manual rotate mechanism use a mechanical rotator and measure the angle of the emission maximum use a digital instrument write a program which can recognize the colour and order number of the emission maximum and thus build a digital database with reliable and highly precise measurement look to quantify systematic error from optical piece misalignment and the aforementioned difference in air pressure and temperature by mean of a different experiment so a to get a proper margin of error use a grate spectrometer we be able to precisely measure rydberg 's constant while thanks to the number of sample and thorough experimental procedure the statistical random error on our result be very small a outline in the previous section comparison with the generally accepted value for rydberg 's constant reveals that we have not measure it to an adequate level of accuracy this be due to the error discus above nonetheless have the value for rydberg 's constant enables u to perform theoretical research a well a to apply our knowledge to practical application

6,GS_FTZ138_Redacted,the excitation and subsequent deexcitation of an electron in an atom result in the emission of one or several photon the rydberg formula relates the difference in the energy state of the electron to the wavelength of the emit photon 1 and contains the rydberg constant hence by determine the wavelength emit and the respective energy transition cause them complete here for hydrogen an accurate value for the rydberg constant can be found the final value determine be 1.07x10 7 ± 6.69x10 4 m -1 which have a difference of 2.42 to the current accepted value a standard grate spectrometer be use to measure the angle of diffraction of the emission line from a hydrogen lamp which allow the wavelength of each line to be calculate the inverse of the wavelength be plot against a function of it correspond excite principal quantum number and the gradient be use to calculate the rydberg constant he balmer series be discover in 1885 and be described by a purely empirical formula relate the inverse wavelength of the emission line see from a hydrogen discharge lamp to a series of integer this formula be then generalize by johannes robert rydberg in 1889 but it be only after development in the atomic model by niels bohr in 1913 that the formula could be explain by theory 1 the derivation for this formula be write in the appendix of this report the balmer series only applies to photon emit in the visible spectrum due to electron deexciting to principal quantum number n 2. however the generalisation can be use to describe other series such a the lyman series of ultraviolet line due to deexcitation to n 1 and can also easily be modify to suit any nucleus 2 where λ be the emit wavelength z be the atomic number of the atom be excite in the case for hydrogen z 1 r∞ be the rydberg constant and n1 and n2 be the principal quantum number of the initial and excite state of the electron respectively n2 n1 the rydberg constant be currently one of the most accurately-measured physical constant with a recommend relative uncertainty of 6.6x10 -12 3 it be an extremely important and relevant constant because it be inherently link to the fine structure constant among several other fundamental constant which can be test for consistency in various physical system hence verify the accuracy of the theory 4 the experimental method use here to determine it value be relatively simple a hydrogen discharge lamp be use to emit various wavelength of light correspond to different energy change due to electron deexciting from different energy level three different wavelength be emit and see through the telescope of a grate spectrometer a each wavelength have diffract by a different amount the grate equation where λ be the wavelength d be the distance between each slit in the grate θ be the angle to the central maximum that a maximum be see and m be the order of diffraction be then use to calculate the wavelength of each emit colour this be do by plot the sine of the angle to the central maximum that a maximum be observe against the order at which the angle be observe multiply the gradient of the resultant graph by d give the wavelength this be repeat for each colour until the three wavelength be found in order to carry out a second plot to determine the value of r∞ the value of n2 for each correspond wavelength have to be found because electron be deexciting to energy level 2 it be deduce that value of n2 have to be 3 4 and 5. the large the difference between n1 and n2 the more energy be emit a light and hence the low the wavelength a plot be make of the inverse wavelength against − and the gradient -which be equal to the value of r∞ -was found the grate spectrometer use be a standard student spectrometer comprise of a collimator telescope and rotatable mount focus knob be use to focus the eyepiece and collimator the eyepiece be focus so that an object a simple mark on an illuminate blank sheet of paper held up against a wall around 30cm away be see clearly and the telescope be focus on an illuminate marker approximately 9m away this be a good enough approximation for the object to be at an `` infinite `` distance so that no parallax be observe blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk t a sodium lamp a then place by the slit to focus the collimator and find the optimal slit width the reason for use this lamp be because a hydrogen lamp which be use for the rest of the experiment would be prone to overheat if left active for large period of time the lamp would have to be continuously run so the time take to focus the collimator be far great than that of take individual measurement a similar procedure be carry out regard the focus the instrument this time focus on an image of the emission spectrum of sodium the lamp initially glowed purple rather than the characteristic orange of sodium due to a small amount of radon present in the lamp before the sodium be completely vapourised the slit width be then low so that the line width observe be low this be do because the width of the line could be use a a measure of uncertainty the angle of the line to the central maximum would be measure at the centre of the line so if the line be wider the measurement be more likely to deviate from the centre of the line ensure that the telescope be precisely 180° to the collimator by line up the centre of the line with the centre of the eyepiece crosswire the vernier scale on the grate table be use to rotate the telescope through 90°00 ± 03 the small realistic value that could be read off the scalewhich read to the near arc-minute and clamped in position the collimator and telescope be then perpendicular to each other the reading on the vernier scale at this point be 15°54 a 300 line/mm grate be place in the rotatable mount at the centre of the grate table this grate a chosen over the 80 line/mm option because in order to calculate the wavelength the grate equation be use assume the error in angle be constant e.g due to resolution of the vernier scale maximise the angle will lead to the minimisation of percentage uncertainty associate with the angle this can be do by increase d in the grate equation in order for the grate to be exactly perpendicular to the collimate incident light the grate be rotate until the reflection of the emission line be see in the telescope this ensure that the grate be 45° to both the collimator and telescope so by add 45°00 to the angle above the grate be position precisely perpendicular to the incident light the telescope be then rotate back to the central maximum of the diffraction pattern the process be repeat for the hydrogen lamp this be do relatively quickly and the lamp do not overheat with the central maximum be at 211°45 and a width of 0°55 212°13 -211°18 table 1.1 to 1.3 below be present a such because each of the three colour violet cyan red be analyse separately to give a distinct wavelength only the mean measure angle be give and the central maximum be observe at angle 211°45 with a width of 0° 55 the width be use a an estimate of uncertainty in θ base on the idea that measurement to the centre of any line can only be make accurate to ± one quarter of the width of the line this be because it be estimate that the angle actually measure would only fall into half the width either side of the true centre of the line the sine of the width of the central maximum be use a the uncertainty in θ when plot sin θ against order however this value be not use in any calculation because it be only a very rough not even take into account the width of the other maximum suggestion a to how uncertainty could be measure fig 1.1 5 a basic pasco model student spectrometer that could be use to determine the wavelength of spectral emission from a hydrogen lamp fig 1.2. show a sodium lamp and spectrometer where the diffraction grate be 45° to both the collimator and telescope this be to ensure it will be precisely perpendicular to the incident light after be rotate precisely 45° clockwise in this case a can be see the angle measure at an order be roughly equal to the angle of the opposite order this agrees with what should be see a the interference pattern be symmetrical about the central maximum furthermore when determine the fit of the line a small value for intercept found for each fit for cyan and red this be of the order -10 -4 and for violet be 10 -3 although this be negligible compare to other source of uncertainty such a the width of the line it do suggest that a slight systematic error may be present one source could be due to the diffraction grate not be precisely perpendicular to the incident light hence result in the modify grate equation where θi be the angle of incidence to the grate this lead to an intercept of -sin θi because the intercept be small and a mixture of both positive and negative value this implies that the grate may have be rotate first in one direction for cyan and red and then in the opposite direction for violet possibly due to a component not be clamped firmly in place the value of the intercept be negligible but worth note here the scipy library also allows for the fit of a line to be calculate the output of which be displayed in the table below scipy be also able to output the covariance matrix which can be use to determine the uncertainty in the gradient and intercept let m represent the gradient of the line for the plot above firstly this allows the wavelength to be found by simply multiply the gradient by the constant d 10 -3 300 m and secondly since the uncertainty in m be give by the root of the first value in the covariance matrix the uncertainty in λ can be calculate by multiply the uncertainty in m by the partial derivative of the right-hand side of equation 3 with respect to m which be simply bohr use the idea that electron could only occupy allow energy level in an atom and can only move between them if give or release the same energy a a photon a the difference between the two level initial i and final f because bohr 's model propose that electron can only emit energy when transition between energy level an electron could move in a stable orbit around the nucleus without emit energy hence the magnitude of the electron 's angular momentum would have to be quantize such that where me be the rest mass of the electron h be planck 's constant n be an integer represent the principal quantum number and rn and vn be the radius and speed of the electron at orbit n. bohr 's simplify model of the electron orbit in a circular orbit around a far large proton meant he could equate the coulomb force to the centripetal force act on the electron at orbit n where e be the magnitude of the charge of the electron and c d be the permittivity of free space solve equation 2 and 3 simultaneously give the follow expression for the radius and speed of an electron at principal quantum number n and 5 the total energy of the electron be the sum of it kinetic and potential energy and by again assume that the electron maintains a stable orbit around a proton be give by it be easily see that this reduces to a change in n from ni to nf will correspond to a change in energy of ei to ef use 1 and 7,superficial,exp
7,GS_BYH124_Redacted,this report present a method which make use of the grate spectrometer for study the spectmm of light of a hydrogen lamp and use this spectmm to determine the rydberg constant the

be use to produce pru•allel beam of light the prism table be use to suppo1t the grate between the collimator and telescope there the grate disperse the light into it different component colour there be also a vemier-calliperlike compass below the prism table on the rotate base which allows u to measure angle see the theory sect.ion for more detail if we look through the eyepiece we can see these different component a well a the original light the screw at b c d and e be use to lock a setup use for the experiment in place 3 a hydrogen lamp be a slim tube consist of two electrode one at each end the lamp contains hydrogen gas at low pressure if we apply a high voltage across the electrode a bright pink glow be enutted by the tube only certain colour can be see with naked eye through the eyepiece when the light be pas through a grate because the other colour be either in the infra-red or ultra-violet region of the light spectmm 4 figure 2 show on the right the light emit by the hydrogen lamp when no grate be present and on the left the three colour which can be see with the spectrometer when the pink light pas through a grate 5 a principal maximum be a region where the intensity of a diffract light passing through a grate be the high l l page whereas a minimum be where the intensity of the diffract light be low principal maximum occur when the phase difference between adjacent ray of a light of wavelength λ be an integer multiple m of 2π where m be the order number 6 the formula for the phase difference be give by the path difference be d sin θ and therefore we obtain the phase angle of the first minimum with n slit illuminate be give by transition wavelength in hydrogen be give via where r∞ be the rydberg constant and n and p be integer represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the atom respectively 6 equation 4 give the balmer series in hydrogen with p 2 and n 3 4 5 ... depend on the colour of the spectrum the band theory suggests that in the atom of a gas the electron orbit the nucleus in a set of energy level 8 by supply sufficient energy to the electron the electron can translate from a low energy level to a high one depend of the distance between the low n 2 and high level n 3 4 5 ... and so depend on the amount of energy supply to the electron we say that electron on high energy level be in the excite state however these excite electron can not remain 'excited for ever and so they eventually fall back to their original energy level in do so the electron emit a packet of energy know a a photon of a certain wavelength transition wavelength 9 for the balmer series the transition wavelength in hydrogen be in the visible part of the spectrum before start the experiment with the hydrogen lamp the spectrometer need to be calibrate prior the eye piece be make to focus on the cross-hair by adjust the screw on the telescope the set should cause a little strain on the eye a possible the camera lens be then focus on a distant object say a building 's window which should be 5 to 10 metre away so a there be no parallax between the image and the cross-hair after this adjustment the telescope be align with the axis of the collimator a sodium lamp be use for the last part of the spectrometer calibration instead of the hydrogen lamp itself because unlike the hydrogen lamp the line spectrum of the light from the monochromatic sodium lamp do not fade away a the lamp get hotter therefore there be no need to rush when calibrate the spectrometer and so we can calibrate the figure 3 show the path difference between two neighbour light ray when a light pas through a grate slit with space d 7 figure 4 represent the balmer transition in a hydrogen atom for different initial state n 3 4 5 6 and final state p 2 depend on the initial state level assort colour be see 10 figure 5 show the setup of the grate spectrometer light from the source pas through the collimator and come out of it a parallel beam the light then pas through the grate where it be diffract into it component use the telescope which can be rotate a magnify image of the different order can be see 11 1 2 with the sodium lamp light on the slit at the collimator be open slightly and the focus of the collimator be adjust until we obtain a sharp image of one of the order at the cross-hair look at the scale of angle on the rotate base the telescope be rotate precisely 90 degree and be fix in that position this scale consists of a main scale 0° -360° which be in degree and a vemier scale o -30 which be in minute just like with a standard vemier calliper the vemier zero be the reference division when reading on the main scale then the vernier scale division which coincides with one of the main scale division be use to calculate the final angle 1 minute on the vemier scale equal to 60° on the main scale 12 let u say for instance we deliberately coincide the vemier zero scale with the 160° main scale division to tum the telescope by 90° the 50° division on the main scale should coincide with the vemier zero division which should remain in a fix position that be only the main scale should be rotate retuming to the spectrometer calibration a suitable grate be place on the table between the collimator and the telescope the grate use in this experiment have approximately 78.8 line per mm 6 the table be rotate until a reflect image of the entrance slit can be see in the eyepiece this usually occurs when the plane of the grate be at 45° a from the collimator axis the telescope be then move around until we get a diffract image of the slit at an enough large angle of diffraction ohl h• ... `` `` `` to left on plane of paper 13 we consider order to the right anticlockwise of the zero order to be positive while order on the right clockwise to b e negative to minimise en-ors when take measurement of angle it be well to measure the angle of the order on both side of the zero order the data for the order number and their con-esponding position from the zero order of the sodium lamp s light be tabulate use these data a graph of d sin 0 against order m eq.2 be plot use a computer with the program language python by write some function both the gradient of the graph and the uncertainty in the gradient can be obtain on the computer the gradient of the graph give u a .. if the calculate wavelength of the light be between 589.0 run and 589.6 run 6 then the spectrometer have be accurately calibrate and so we can begin the ma.in experiment with the hydrogen lamp after have obtain the wavelength of the different colour from the hydrogen lamp with the same method mention in the previous paragraph a graph of 1/ a. against 1/n 2 -1/p 2 eq.4 be plot and the gradient uncertainty can b e obtain use python the gradient of this graph give u the negative of the rydberg 's constant the wavelength of sodium obtain in this experiment be 878 ± 180 run the latter do not fall in the range between 589.0 run and 589 .6 run even if we consider the uncertainty associate with it this prof that the calibration be not properly do or/and there be lot of systematic e1rnrs the graph figure 7 below show the straight-line relationship of d sin 0 against order m. for the second graph figure 8 which depicts the plot of the three visible component of hydrogen the w avelength obtain for the red component be 67 1 ± 82 run that of the blue component be 480 ± 140 nm and finally the wavelength of the violet component be 625 ± 120 nm the wavelength of the red and blue l • determine the wavelength of hydrogen emission spectrum component fall in the officially accepted range which be between 622 nm -780 run and betv.•een 455 nm -492 nm respectively 14 if we consider the uncertainty associate with them how ever the calculate value for the violet co~ponent do not fall in the range 390 run -455 nm 14 which mean there be lot of source of eitor during it measurement the intersection of the line give an indication how accurately the grate spectrometer w a calibrate the closer the intersection be to the zero-order m the well the calibration of the grate spectrometer be ultimately the gradient of the final graph figure 9 which be a plot of 1/ a against l/n 2 -l/p 2 give u the negative of the rydberg constant for the red colour n 3 for the blue colour n 5 and for the violet one n 6 10 thus the positive value of the latter obtain computationally be then the main aim of the experiment be to detennine the rydberg constant roo use a hydrogen lamp and the grate spectroscopy method a sodium lamp be use durin the calibration of the grate spectrometer during the experiment there be a lot of problem and systematic eitors w e encounter and this can be show that our result obtain for the rydberg constant 3.45 ± 1.03 x 10 6 m-1 be very far from the officially accepted value 1 0 973 731.6 m-1 5 the first problem be that after sometimes it become ve1y difficult to position accurately the cross-hair on the violet ~olow spectrum of the hydrogen light due to the ve1y low light m tens1ty we could not even see the cross-hair through the eyepiece secondly we knew during the experiment that a the hydrogen lamp get more and more hot the colour component of the latter fade away and so we decide to tum the lamp off for the lamp to cool down however when we try to tum it on again the lamp never light on • again and so we have to change our hydrogen lamp therefore i think that take measurement of the violet colour from another hydrogen lamp induced significant uncertainty in our result the third problem be that it be quite difficult to read the scale on the spectrometer rotate base even use a loop equip with a light bulb while try to read the scale of angle it cause some eye-strained to address the first and second problem a deuterium lamp can be use to detemune the rydberg constant instead of a hydrogen lamp because the deuterium lamp give great intensity and have a longer life even though it cost more 15 the third problem can be solve by use a grate spectrometer which have a digital scale of angle so that the measurement of the position of the order be more accurate and easy to read even though we do not get the result we hop for this experiment taught u how to calibrate a grate spectrometer how to use it to determine the rydberg

8,GS_TGO908_Redacted,10 900 000 ± 232 000 m-1 chemical element emit discrete frequency of electromagnetic radiation when atom go from a high energy state to a low energy state the transition of electron from a high energy level eu to a low energy level el cause the emission of photon with energy a diffraction grate can separate frequency of this electromagnetic radiation when a beam of light be incident upon it give unique emission spectrum for each element this be possible because distinct wavelength of light deviate from the central maximum by different amount the formula relates the wavelength 𝜆 of light from a maximum in the emission spectrum to the principal quantum number 𝑛 𝑈 and 𝑛 𝐿 where 𝑛 𝑈 be the high energy level and 𝑛 𝐿 be the low energy level r represent the rydberg constant whose value we to derive use a spectrum of hydrogen in this experiment the frack-hertz experiment 1 portrayed the existence of energy level by investigate the motion of electron in mercury vapour electron orbit the nucleus at fix radius and spectral line be of discrete wavelength imply that the magnitude of an electron angular momentum be quantise 2 mathematically represent a this be far corroborate when instead of a particle approach we take a wave approach to the atomic model where electron be stand wave with wavelength 𝜆 𝑛 a distance 𝑟 𝑛 away from the nucleus for a stand wave to be feasible the wavelength in a circular orbit should be a whole number n 1 2 3 … use 4 and de broglie 's relationship for wavelength and momentum 3 can be derive in hydrogen the force require to cause centripetal acceleration of the electron around the proton be provide by the electrical attraction between the two negatively charge particle combine coulomb 's law and newton 's second law give u the equation simultaneously equate 3 and 5 give value for 𝑟 𝑛 and 𝑣 𝑛 that can be use to obtain the total energy for the n th orbit in the bohr model en which can conventionally be write a where r be the rydberg constant the rydberg formula 2 can very simply give the wavelength of the radiation emit when electron transition energy level in this experiment the high energy level 𝑛 𝑈 from which the electron de-excites be 3 4 and 5 with the photon colour be red blue and violet respectively in the laboratory we determine the rydberg constant by shin a hydrogen lamp through a spectrometer to obtain an emission spectrum the spectrometer use consist of a collimator and telescope between which the diffraction grate be place a light from the source pas through the slit into the collimator a beam of parallel light ray be produce 3 incident on the diffraction grate in accordance with huygens principle 4 the beam of light disperses into a spectrum accord to huygens each point the grate spectrometer -rydberg constant despite the same person reading the scale in addition to the ± 3ʹ error from reading the value there would be a far ± 3ʹ error due to any fault in set up the spectrometer for the red and blue line the slit width be extremely narrow result in a negligible error due to a wide slit for the violet spectral line we measure the difference in angle between one end of the band to the other to be 1ʹ when graph these error be very inconspicuous after obtain value for 𝜃 for different order number n plot graph for 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against n give straight line for each wavelength due to the proportional relationship between them with a gradient use the covariance matrix in python the graphical uncertainty show in table ii can be calculate along with value for the rydberg constant in table i the error from measure and incorrect calibration be much high than these value meaning they be more significant than the statistical error from table i the average rydberg constant can be calculate a 10 863 637 m -1 the uncertainty from table ii table iii and the standard error from the mean calculation add in quadrature give the uncertainty correspond with the average rydberg constant which be 231 705 m -1 therefore the result of the experiment be 10 900 000 ± 232 000 𝑚 −1 there be a possibility if the set up of the spectrometer have go significantly wrong that there be a substantial systematic error in the value calculate a way to recognise the systematic error would be to repeat the experiment with different equipment and set up the spectrometer again another way to analyse the result obtain be to realise that the beam at order number n 1 and n -1 be symmetrical about the zero-order beam path therefore the value 𝜃 for both these order be the same this give u two value for each order from which an average angular deviation can be found however these can not be use to calculate the standard error for each order wavelength additionally this method of analysis do not require graphical representation of the result at all an example of this method be use with the red spectral line be show in table iv from here an average wavelength for the specific colour can be compute and then this can be substitute into the rydberg formula in this method of analysis there be statistical uncertainty due to work out the mean instead of the graphical uncertainty from the initial method the standard error of the wavelength be manipulate to become the error in the rydberg constant calculate use each of the three wavelength far manipulation of the uncertainty and the value for the rydberg constant the result determine by this analysis method be 10 900 000 ± 244 000 𝑚 −1 this value be relatively similar to the one calculate from the previous analysis the difference be that the uncertainty in this method be slightly great this could be due to the addition of the standard error in calculation the standard error in inversely proportional to the square root of the number of data sample a way to improve the uncertainty in this method be to increase the number of data sample in this experiment the value obtain for the rydberg constant be in the same magnitude a the measure value also it be consistent to 2 significance level however there be many improvement which can be make so that the error associate with this value be decrease firstly obtain more data would mean the value for the deviation angle be more reliable also it would allow an average to be calculate this reduces the chance of anomaly in calculation which could be due to misjudgement of the vernier scale even though an average can be calculate by use the second analysis in the result section the number of total data point remain the same so the anomaly can not be recognise and omit a well a possible also calculate the standard error with a sample of 2 will give a large error contribution secondly increase the width of the slit for the violet spectral line cause a high contribution of uncertainty to the final value a way to improve would be to remove any other source of light present in the space around u this would increase the contrast between the black background and violet spectral line the rydberg constant be useful because it be part of an elegant formula that allows the transition wavelength to be calculate easily,superficial,bal

one of the few where we can observe at our macroscopic scale phenomenon have a quantum origin indeed we observe that atom light emission be quantify to specific wavelength this observation lead u to discus the dual nature of light this experiment u the effect of light diffraction see ii.a to look at what happens inside the atom the rydberg constant be one of the fundamental physical constant and be today know to 14 decimal place 1 use a grate spectrometer see fig 2 to look at the emission ray of hydrogen atom come from a hydrogen lamp see fig 2 we aim to calculate the rydberg constant this very precise instrument use in a dark room allow u to limit noisy light to a minimum level a. about the grate spectrometer consider light a wave we know that white light be a superposition of all the visible colour 3 indeed it be compose of wave of wavelength from 400 nm to 700nm we can decompose any light into it different wavelength use either a prism or a grate in our case we use a grate which be a transparent piece of glass which contain a very large number of equally space narrow line when light shine through a grate it be diffract by the line and light change it path by an angle θ give by 2𝜋 𝜆 d sin 𝜃 2𝜋m 2 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the light d be the space between two line of the grate and m be the number of the ray from the central ray when light go through an obstacle of a width of the same magnitude a it wavelength it get diffract 4 because of this phenomenon of diffraction the ray be displace from the straight path and appear a thin ray repeat themselves a we turn the telescope the light 's maximum intensity which be the ray we see be locate at 2𝜋m m be the number of the ray 2 rearrange 1 we have 2 we can therefore see that a beam of light contain different wavelength get separate into ray of a specific wavelength shift from the straight path by an angle θ depend on their wavelength accord to bohr 's model 5 atom be compose of a central nucleus compose of both proton and neutron and of a set of layer contain a define number of electron depend on the energy they carry the electron can pa from one `` layer `` call level of energy to another this change of level of energy be call a `` quantum leap `` if the electron jump from a low level of energy to a high one it absorbs energy in the form of a photon particle of light of a particular wavelength reversely an energise electron will quickly 5 return to a low level of energy by emit it excess of energy in the form of a photon of the wavelength correspond to the one of the photon it initially absorbed in the quantum theory everything be quantify that be why we be in presence of specific wavelength and energy level the hydrogen lamp function accord to this quantum theory indeed the lamp contains hydrogen atom see fig 2 that be excite by the heating of the lamp and emit light of specific wavelength when the atom be deexciting come back to low energy level 5 the hydrogen atom emits ray both visible ultraviolet and infrared the visible ray be give by the balmer series 2 and correspond to transition from the high energy level 6 th to 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level the visible ray be show in fig 1. visible wavelength emit by a hydrogen atom from left to right the ray correspond to transition from the 6 th to the 2 nd energy level from the 5 th to the 2 nd from the 4 th to the 2 nd and from the 3 rd to the 2 nd 2 c. about the rydberg constant measure the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw the rydberg constant r ∞ relates the transition between level of energy to the wavelength of the emit or absorbed photon for a transition between level n to level p n p we have where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the emit photon accord to the theory we should be able to distinguish 3 different ray of light with different wavelength each correspond to a specific transition in the hydrogen atom we be also suppose to see these ray repeat themselves a few time a we rotate the spectrometer r ∞ be also give by where 𝑚 e be the rest mass of the electron 𝜀 0 be the permittivity of free space 𝑒 be the electron 's charge 𝑐 be the speed of light in vacuum and ℎ be plank 's constant the accepted value for this fundamental constant be 1.097 373 156 8508 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 1 note in the case of the hydrogen atom the value of the rydberg constant be slightly different a it have to take into account the effect of the central proton 6 in the case of the hydrogen atom the rydberg constant r h be give by r h e h hc 6 5 where e h be the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom h be the planck 's constant and c the speed of light in vacuum however the difference be too small to be apprehend at our level of precision and we will therefore calculate r ∞ first of all we have to set up our spectrometer a show in fig 2. after understand what the principal piece be we start to look at the light emit by a sodium lamp we do not use the hydrogen lamp to set up the apparatus a it heat up quickly and tends to shut down after 15 to 20 minute of use to determine what be the straight path of light we place the 78.8 lines/mm grate at 45° of the incoming light we turn the rotate arm of the spectrometer until the light reflect by the grate be visible see ii.a we take note of the position of the arm know from the law of reflection that the reflection angle be the same a the incident angle we deduct that our straight path be at 45° to this measurement we deduce that our spectrometer be align when the rotate arm be at 349.42° when observe the spectrum of emission of the hydrogen lamp we observe 3 different colour red light blue and purple the purple be harder to see than the other colour rotate our telescope we saw that the ray repeat themselves multiple time a predict by the theory see ii.a regard the allocate time and the fact that we could not have the hydrogen lamp light for a very long time we chose to take 3 time the same set of measurement let the lamp cool down between measurement for each colour we chose to measure the angle of diffraction of the 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd ray go to the left correspond respectively to 𝑚 1 2 3 and of the correspond ray go to the right 𝑚 −1 −2 −3 a well a of the central ray 𝑚 0 we therefore aim to have 21 measurement per colour if we have have more time we would have measure the 4 th ray for each colour to the left and to the right three time for each colour rather than take a fourth time 7 measurement for each colour we be indeed interested in the overall trend of the ratio 𝑚/ sin 𝜃 and not in the particular angle 𝜃 at which be locate each ray because of noisy light in the room the purple ray be really faint and hence hard to see sometimes we be not sure if the ray we be observe be the second or the third purple ray another probable source of error be also that we do n't see the difference between two violet wavelength indeed we saw very faint purple line and we estimate that they be all of the same wavelength but accord to theory we should have have two violet ray we therefore chose to make measurement for the purple ray keep in mind that they have a high degree of uncertainty and that we could and probably should not use them when calculate the value of the rydberg constant we try to get the purple ray a bright a possible by measure them last when the hydrogen lamp be hotter and the ray brighter a more atom would deexcite in the same time however it be not good enough we manage to take only one measurement of the ray -2 and 2 and only 2 measurement of the ray -3 and 3. we estimate that we have an error of ±15 arc minute on measurement -2 and 2 we indeed ca n't determine statistically the error despite poor light condition the grate spectrometer be overall very precise for this kind of experiment indeed because of the slit situate on the light 's path and because of the process of interference the ray of light be situate in a small region of space this help in the precision so do the cross-wire see fig 2 two thin black line cross each other in the centre of the lens that help centre the measurement exactly in the centre of the ray another feature of the spectrometer that improves greatly precision be the vernier scale this apparatus be precise to 1 which corresponds to a precision of 0.02° put together the different measurement and use the statistical method to determine the error we obtain the result show in table i where 𝜃 blue be the angle of the blue ray subtract the value of each ray 's position to the value of the central ray we find the relative angle of displacement of each ray take the sine of the angle of the relative angle of displacement and plot it against the ray number we obtain the graph give in fig 3 a b and c use 2 on the measurement summarise in table i the value of d calculate in 5 and obtain error use the statistical method we calculate the value of the wavelength of each colour a be 𝜆 red 6.67 ± 0.19 × 10 −7 𝑚 𝜆 blue 4.95 ± 0.05 × 10 −7 𝑚 and 𝜆 purple 4.95 ± 0.31 × 10 −7 𝑚. a we can see our measurement for the purple wavelength seem wrong a they have a high uncertainty and be not coherent a we calculate the same wavelength for the blue and purple set of ray this comfort the hypothesis make in section iii b that the measurement of purple ray be unprecise and should not be use in far calculation a we have see in part section ii.b the blue ray correspond to a transition from level 4 to level 2. rearrange 3 we have take 𝜆 𝜆 blue n=2 and p=4 we can calculate an experimental value of 𝑅 ∞ 𝑅 ∞ blue 1.08 ± 0.01 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 similarly the red ray correspond to a transition from the 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level use 𝜆 red n=2 and p=3 and 6 we find 𝑅 ∞ red 1.08 ± 0.03 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 take the mean of these two value and the mean error we find our experimental value for the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ exp 1.08 ± 0.02 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 we estimate that the error come from different source firstly a part of our error come from a move of the grate that result in a misalignment of the spectrometer indeed we see that our central ray the one not be deflect be n't always at the same position use statistical mean to calculate error we find that this central ray be locate at 168.85 ± 0.05° we can therefore estimate our error a be 0.05° furthermore if the vernier scale allow u a great precision it be also sometimes a bit hard to read we consider that we have a random error of ±3 ′ on the measurement use the vernier scale of each angle because of the parallax effect and the bad visibility in the dark room we also estimate that we have an error of ±2.5 on the determination of the ray position indeed we measure that the width of our ray be 10 we consider that we know whether we be closer to one of the border or to the centre of the ray but we ca n't really determine if we be at ¼ of the ray or at ½ of it therefore our error here be the quarter of the ray width 10/4 2.5 we also have source of error in the fact that the spectrometer might have move horizontally and would not be exactly in front of the slit anymore this a well a the background light present in the room during the experiment reduce the relative brightness of the observe ray and cause u to cast out our measurement of the purple ray finally environmental condition such a the ambient humidity temperature and air pressure probably influence the behaviour of the hydrogen atom however they be difficult to estimate and we consider that they be negligible ideally we could determine their magnitude by do the experiment in different meteorological condition however it seem really difficult to do it practise because of the multiple vary factor humidity temperature noisy light ... that prevent u from repeat the experiment in the exact same condition add all the estimate error we find an error of 0.14° which corresponds to an error in the wavelength of 0.18 × 10 −7 𝑚 which be small than our error on the red wavelength but still of the same order of magnitude we therefore chose our measure value for the error a they be big than the estimate one the accepted value of the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 1 lie within our margin of error our estimate for the rydberg constant be 𝑅 ∞ exp 1.08 ± 0.02 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 and be coherent with the theory we observe that the hydrogen atom emits only at certain wavelength which be coherent with the quantum picture and the description of light a a particle in the experiment we also experienced diffraction of light through the grate a phenomenon more easily explain by a wave-like picture of light this experiment be one of the few that relates quantum mechanic to optic allow u to encounter the wave-particle duality because we use a very precise apparatus we have less than a 2 error in our value for the constant this error come at 35 from a displacement from alignment at 35 from a unprecise reading of the vernier scale and at 30 from a difficult determination of the ray position the condition of experience brightness temperature humidity air pressure… played a role a they prevent u from make use of the purple ray a well a be source of systematic error however they ca n't be estimate use this sole experiment we could determine their magnitude by repeat the experiment in different meteorological condition the strength of this experiment be it precision the comprehensive view of the atom it give and the link it make between quantum mechanic and optic thanks to the precise apparatus we use this experiment be successful however it can be strongly improve by make it in a proper dark room with a more powerful hydrogen lamp that would allow u to measure the two purple set of ray a well a the blue and red one more precisely calculate the constant use 4 wavelength would indeed be more precise we could also measure a 4 th and even a 5 th ray from the central ray to improve our precision even far,superficial,the
10,GS_VLS445_Redacted,a of recent time the rydberg be one of the most accurately measure fundamental physical constant this report review how the rydberg constant be calculate use a grate spectrometer this be the primary aim of the experiment another aim be to become familiar with a spectrometer and how it can be use in different way to study spectrum a spectrometer be use to analyse a spectrum of light from a know source by take measurement of the angle between spectrum line and use knowledge of balmer transition the formula for the rydberg constant be solve a value of 2.088e+07𝒎 −𝟏 +/-1.087e+07𝒎 −𝟏 be obtain he rydberg constant be a fundamental constant which be very important in atomic physic it be name after the swedish physicist johannes rydberg who developed the formula use in this lab report to obtain a value for this constant the constant describes the wavelength of the photon of light emit a spectral line in transition in the balmer series the easy atom to study be the hydrogen due to their simple structure this be why a hydrogen lamp be use in this experiment in the lamp be hot electrically excite hydrogen gas this cause it to emit a spectrum that 's concentrate only at a few specific wavelength the space between these bright line provide data which can be use to draw many conclusion include the conclusion of this experiment spectroscopy be a highly successful and powerful technique due to the fact that it be non-invasive the other piece of equipment use be the grate spectrometer this be an instrument use to study the spectrum of light emit by the hydrogen lamp it u a lens to produce a collimate beam of light a diffraction grate disperses this beam due to it series of very fine groove cut in it surface the disperse beam be then focus by the camera onto the eyepiece of the spectrometer the spectrometer be make up of three component a collimator a diffraction grate and a telescope this be show in the schematic diagram below the light from the hydrogen lamp enters through an adjustable slit which be use to focus the camera this will be explain in the method the slit be strategically position at the focal point of the collimator to ensure that all the light passing through the diffraction grate be one parallel collimate beam of light all beam have the same angle of incidence the diffraction grate be simplify to a large number of equally space very narrow slit this cause the beam to disperse and the pattern be picked up at the telescope the diffraction angle depends on the wavelength of the light this be illustrate by the follow equation where d be the slit separation sin 𝜃 be the sin of the angle between adjacent emission line m be an integer and 𝜆 be the specific wavelength of that colour of light this equation implies a straight line when sin 𝜃 be plot against m. this allows for the wavelength and their uncertainty to be determine from the gradient and error bar which be calculate use python the diagram below show the diffraction patter for 4 slit the balmer series be the series of visible line which a discharge lamp emits the formula to describe these line be found by johaan balmer and be give by where n and p be integer represent the initial and final state of the atom the value of p for hydrogen be always 2 for balmer transition therefore this equation can be use to plot to give a straight line the rydberg constant and it uncertainty be calculate from there this phenomenon of why hydrogen only emit four line also know a the balmer line of hydrogen be explain by niels bohr in his model for the atom the electron which orbit the proton can only exist in certain orbital state a quantum number the diagram below show a visual representation of these transition the experiment be carry out in a dark room in the laboratory to allow clearer image to see through the spectrometer and reduce human error the method that be carry out in order to obtain all the data need be a follow  the first and most important part of the experiment be set up the spectrometer so that it be in focus  the camera lens be focus on a distant object so that the cross wire be on top of it  then the hydrogen lamp be place near the slit and the collimator focus be adjust until a sharp image be show  in order to ensure that the collimator be align at 0 degree with the camera the telescope be move through 90 degree and clamped  then the grate table be turn until a reflect image be see use a mirror in place of the diffraction grate  at this point the collimator and camera be at 45 degree from each other the telescope be rotate back through 45 degree and this give normal incidence to give the zeroth order measurement  for each colour the telescope be rotate in both direction to look for the 1 st 2 nd etc order emission line  the angle of each line be record  measurement for the error be also take the width of the line be measure for each line i.e the difference in the angle between the two side of the strip  this be the great source of uncertainty in this experiment and therefore it be the data use to plot the errorbars on the graph in the result  at first it be thought that the great source of error would be from partner record different angle however when this be compare with the other source of error it be found that the subjective reading be much less significant than the error due to not know where to position the cross hair on every line a note regard the procedure that be follow be that after take the measurement for the first colour the hydrogen lamp stop work so it be replace with another one it be attempt to place it in exactly the same position so that it would not cause the reading for different colour to be inconsistent below be graph of sin 𝜃 against m for each colour these be use to calculate the wavelength it can be see that they all follow straight line trend use python 's poly1fit function the equation for each line of best fit be obtain the uncertainty be include from here the graph to calculate the rydberg constant be plot the equation for this line be 2.088e+07 x 7.83e+0 the magnitude of the gradient of this graph 2.088e+07𝑚 −1 from earlier error calculation the uncertainty in this gradient be 1.087e+07𝑚 −1 from the above graph it be clear that one point be an anomaly and so it be not include in the calculation the reason it be so far off from the trendline be that the blue light measurement be take use one lamp whereas the other two be both do use the same lamp although use only 2 point reduces the validity of the experiment conclusion can still be make furthermore the wavelength obtain be of the same order of magnitude but they be low than their actual value this be due to a systematic error which in this experiment be human error in reading the angle from the spectrometer the official accepted value for the rydberg constant be 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 the value of 2.088e+07𝑚 −1 +/-1.087e+07𝑚 −1 be of the same order of magnitude a this furthermore the accepted value lie within the error range of the experimental value,superficial,none
11,GS_CYF541_Redacted,the principle purpose of the conduct experiment be to calculate rydberg constant `` r `` the value be found to be r 11123886.85 ± 1317838m -1 this be calculate by mean of a spectrometer where hydrogen light be normally incident on a diffraction grate thus separate the different color of hydrogen a telescope be then use to measure the diffraction angle correspond to several order and the wavelength of the associate color for the balmer series of hydrogen the balmer series governs the descent of electron from high energy level to the second energy level then the rydberg constant be calculate use the three wavelength of the hydrogen light red violet and blue finally the mean value of the three obtain rydberg constant be obtain and use a the value of the rydberg constant the calculate value of the rydberg constant along with it associate error be within the range of the actual value the difference between the two value can be mainly attribute to different random and instrumental error which be discus thoroughly in this report the main aim behind the conduct experiment be to determine `` rydberg `` constant use the spectrum of hydrogen rydberg constant be a fundamental atomic constant which appear in several relationship famously associate with the hydrogen atom and have unit of m -1 1 this be determine by study the diffraction pattern of hydrogen light use a spectrometer a spectrometer be an instrument use to study different phenomenon of light 2 see section iii historically isaac newton in 1666 be the first scientist who demonstrate that sunlight be constitute of several different color and coin the word `` spectrum `` after that several other scientist include melville and angstrom study the different spectral line of different type of light until rydberg in 1890 mathematically derive a formula which include this constant finally bohr show that it can be express in more fundamental term 3 see section ii in this experiment the rydberg constant be determine use the relation of associate with the balmer series the balmer series describes the transition of electron in the hydrogen atom from high energy state to state of n=2 where n be the quantum number the spectral line consider in this experiment be the line correspond to n=3 red wavelength n=4 blue wavelength and n=5 violet wavelength which be in the visible spectrum 4 it be important to note that the balmer series contains several spectral line which be in the ultraviolet region furthermore determine the different wavelength of the three spectral line be base on the phenomenon of diffraction whereby incident light from the source bend when it encounter a diffraction grate 5 the main phenomenon behind this experiment be diffraction of light diffraction of light a mention in the introduction section be the phenomenon where a beam of light be spread out when encounter an obstacle grate in this case by geometrically analyze the pattern obtain the follow relationship can be derive where d be the slit separation in meter θ be the angle between two beam of light in radian m be the order number and λ be the wavelength of the incident light in meter a mention in the introduction section the balmer series be use to obtain the rydberg constant it be express a follow where r ∞ be rydberg constant in m -1 and n and p be integer which represent energy level of initial and final state respectively the rydberg constant can be express in more fundamental constant a where ɑ be a constant me be the electron mass kg c be the speed of light in vacuum m/s and h be planck 's constant joule second furthermore the constant ɑ can be determine use the follow formula determination of the rydberg constant use the spectrum of hydrogen where ϵ 0 be the permittivity in free space farad per meter therefore use equation 1 the wavelength of the three spectral line red blue and violet be calculate by plot three fit of sin θ v the order m where the slope of these plot represent λ/d hence from equation 2 and note that the value of p in the balmer series be 2 rydberg constant be determine the first step in the experiment be to adequately align the spectrometer first the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire by view the image of a distant object the window of the building face the lab a sodium lamp be then use for the purpose of position the telescope so that it be align with the axis of the collimator after that the telescope be move 90 degree the vernier scale be use to measure the angle and a grate be place in the holder the table be turn until a reflect image be see which indicates that it be at an angle of 45 degree finally the grate be place so that the beam be at normal incidence and then the telescope be position back to face the grate the sodium lamp be replace by the hydrogen lamp to start obtain data in order to determine rydberg constant the diffraction pattern of the hydrogen light be observe the telescope be use to observe the different spectral line at different order negative and positive order the start position be the zeroth order which have all three spectral line red blue and violet overlap then for the red and blue spectral line the angle of the order from m=-4 to m=4 be measure by reading the vernier scale however for the violet spectral line we be only able to observe the order from m=-2 to m=2 it be also important to note that the error in the vernier scale be take to be ±0.5 arcminute after obtain the data a plot be create use python for three fit for the three different spectral line of sin θ v the order m from which the wavelength of the light be obtain from these three different wavelength three different value of the rydberg constant be obtain and the mean and error of the value be calculate use python a well 6 the experimental data obtain in this experiment be diffraction angle for the three different spectral line of hydrogen at different negative and positive order hence a graph of sin θ v the order m be obtain graph 1 the plot of the three spectral line of hydrogen red blue and violet of equation y 0.05164x -0.002256 y 0.03728x 0.007478 and y 0.03377x -0.00164 respectively the three plot show a linear straight line a expect from the relation represent in equation 1 from the slope of the three fit the wavelength of the spectral line be calculate a follow similarly λviolet 473 nm and λviolet 428 nm hence use the three value of the wavelength three value of the rydberg constant be obtain from equation 2 it be important to note that the value for n for the red blue and violet wavelength be 3 4 and 5 respectively 7 the value of the rydberg constant be rred 10986831.91m -1 rblue 11273247.5m -1 and rviolet 11111581.14m -1 thus the mean value of the rydberg constant be calculate to be r 11123886.85m -1 associate uncertainty calculate in the follow section use python the error in the slope of the three fit be estimate and hence the error in the wavelength be calculate then δλred 8.1 nm similarly δλblue 54.8 nm and δλviolet 4.29 nm where the symbol δ mean the error of correspondingly the error in the three rydberg constant be δrred 135867 1306076 and δrviolet 111375. thus the error in the mean rydberg constant be δr 111375 this be calculate use the formula of the standard deviation and the number n of the dataset therefore the value of the rydberg constant obtain be r 11123886.85 ± 1317838. the calculate value of the rydberg constant along with it error lie within the range of the accepted value which be r 10973731.6 m -1 this indicates that the value be relatively accurate but do not rule out the possibility of the existence of systematic error equation 1 indicates that y-intercept of such fit should be zero which do not agree with the result although the y-intercept be small this be also the result of the existence of several source of error there be several source of error in the conduct experiment which explain the difference between the calculate value and the actual one first of all error in measure the diffraction angle due to the instrumental error of the vernier scale which be estimate to be 1 arc minute furthermore parallax error be take into consideration due to the difficulty in reading such small value at different angle to reduce parallax error my lab partner and i try to separately do the reading from the same angle for all measurement several outer source of error be present include light from neighbor experiment this be mainly evident when observe the violet spectral line be upon turn off the light from neighbor experiment two more order become clearly observe concern systematic error some possible source of error include the calibration of the spectrometer in other word the position of the telescope or grate might not have be exactly a require which therefore would have affected all the obtain measurement additionally the eyepiece of the spectrometer be open in order to see large beam of light this in turn make it more difficult to see where exactly the spectral line be align with the cross wire moreover influence from external source light from outside might also have result in affect all the measurement finally possibly the major factor which explains the difference between the two value would be the number of data point obtain especially in the violet spectral line we be only able to obtain angle for 4 order from m=-2 to m=2 which would decrease the accuracy of the result it should be note that all the above uncertainty be take into consideration and express a error bar in graph 1 above the main aim of the conduct experiment be to calculate the value of rydberg constant the major result be therefore the r 11123886.85 ± 1317838 m -1 the calculate value of the along with it error lie within the range of the actual value of the rydberg constant the key success in the experiment be mainly be able to measure the diffraction angle the wavelength of the spectral line and thus the rydberg constant the main shortcoming be the rather large random error associate with the value of the rydberg constant this can be attribute to instrumental and random error related o the measurement take and possibly also to systematic error mainly due the calibration of the spectrometer there be several way to improve the result the main method to follow would be to obtain more data point this could be do by eliminate almost all possible source of light which would enable u to observe high order of diffraction both on the negative and positive side furthermore use a more advanced spectrometer which would show a clearer diffraction pattern would also result in show more order a more advanced spectrometer would also ensure that the spectral line would almost be exactly align on the cross wire which would increase the accuracy of the measure angle this experiment prove that by use the spectrometer to observe the diffraction of hydrogen light we be able to calculate to a relatively high degree of accuracy a fundamental constant in atomic physic,superficial,bal

use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant r∞ this experiment result in a value for the rydberg constant a 10860000 ± 31690 m -1 a oppose to the literature value of 10973731.568508 m -1 because it be expressible a a product of many of the fundamental constant of physic a a result many experiment have be devise and carry out to make it one of the most precisely know physical constant a this

wavelength of light get diffract be measure for a many order a they remain visible fro m this data the wavelength of the light present in the spectrum can be calculate which in turn can be use to obtain a value for the rydberg constant r∞ if a gas be electrically excite it emits radiation at a few specific well-defined wavelength the wavelength that be present depend on the energy level within the atom of the substance produce the spectrum this be because a an electron transition from a high energy level to a low one it loses energy by emit a photon the energy of the photon be equal to the difference in energy between the two level if only one atom be present then only one emission lin e would be visible at any one time however a there be a copious amount of hydrogen all the emission

493 ± 3.61nm and 438 ± 1.97 nm respectively these value be all great than their literature value by a similar amount -5nm 7nm and 4nm this show that there be an error of a systematic nature that be affect our result there be many possible source of error in this experiment with two of the most influential be a misalignment of the spectrometer and the human error involve in reading the vernier scale other small source of error include the grate period and the fact that the refractive index of air be n't 1. calculate a value for the rydberg constant with the value of each wavelength in turn

-preliminary data `` red `` fit `` red `` data fig 7. graph result from first data run red emission line this be the preliminary data record use the newly developed in/out method a before there be clearly a strong correlation between the two variable the uncertainty for m 0 be due to the fact that two central emission line be visible a cyan and a red at the centre they merge but it be difficult to determine whether these emission line should be treat a one or a two slightly separate emission line for this point they be treat a one thus increase the emission line width and therefore the uncertainty in the measurement of θ. these data give a wavelength of 654.7 ± 0.2 nm and hence n 3. a value for the rydberg constant r∞ be calculate a 1.0997 ± 0.0004 × 10 7 m −1 the accepted value of r∞ do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty this new method have successfully reduce the uncertainty in the measurement however the value calculate for r∞ do not agree with the

give a wavelength of 484.6 ± 0.1 nm and hence n 4. a value for the rydberg constant r∞ be calculate a 1.1006 ± 0.0002 × 10 7 m −1 the accepted value of r∞ do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty line since hydrogen do not have an orange colour emission line this line be measure and a wavelength of 587.5 ± 0.3 nm be record the data for this line be outline in figure 10. the origin of this orange emission line be unknown perhaps it originate from some out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp due to the high temperature inside although this do seem very unlikely an experiment study the emission spectrum of nacl solution flame test have be carry out with the equipment before this data run have be carry out although this do not seem to have affected the equipment in any way two final value for the rydberg constant be calculate one for each run of the experiment but take the mean of both the calculate value and their uncertainty for the first run of the experiment a final value of 1.111 ± 0.006 × 10 7 m −1 be calculate and can be see plot in figure 11 a `` average run 1 `` for the second run of the experiment a final value of 1.1004±0.0004 ×10 7 m −1 be calculate and can also be see plot in figure 11 a `` average run 2 `` a can be see in figure 11 the accepted value for r ∞ do not fall within any of the range define by the calculate value and their respective uncertainty however the data collect from each run be clearly quite different run 2 -orange -definitive data `` orange `` fit `` orange `` data fig 10. graph result from first data run orange emission line this be the definitive data record use the newly developed in/out method interestingly an orange emission line be observe in the hydrogen emission spectrum there do not exist an orange emission line hence this be measure in order to record a wavelength such that this emission line could later be look up this emission line be the brightest and clearest of the three observe during the definitive data run these data give a wavelength of 587.5 ± 0.3 nm from a previous experiment in which the emission line of sodium be measure a 587.7 ± 0.4 nm use a sodium vapour lamp and 587.6 ± 0.4 nm use a nacl flame test -both of these measurement use the in/out method this emission line be clearly identify a sodium j. sansonetti give this emission line of sodium a 588.9950954 ± 0.0000015 nm 5 data from the first run be less precise and also less accurate than data from the second run furthermore the uncertainty for the measurement take in the first run be clearly large in magnitude than the uncertainty for the measurement take in the second run the reason for this be unknown however it be hypothesise that the stark difference in each data set 's accuracy be due to the alignment of the spectrometer before the data be collect during the alignment process for the first run of the experiment explain in section iii when the grate be turn by precisely 45 • such that it be meant to be at 90 • to the centre line it be clearly not this perplexed u and the alignment process be attempt again upon repeat the alignment process the grate be still not perfectly align however we attempt to continue with the experiment for the second run the same issue occur again however this time the effect be much less pronounce although the grate do not seem to be at exactly 90 • to the centre line of the collimator the hypothesis be the data from the first run be less accurate more spread out because the spectrometer be more misalign whereas the data from the second run be more accurate less spread out because the spectrometer be less misalign in this experiment the rydberg constant for hydrogen be calculate a 1.1004 ± 0.0004 × 10 7 m −1 use angle measurement take with a grate spectrometer a hydrogen vapour lamp be use a the light source in order to observe fig 11. all of the calculate value for the rydberg constant value from run 1 have a large spread than those from run 2. also the value from run 1 have much wider uncertainty than from run 2 run 2 use the in/out method whereas run 1 do not average mean be take of the calculate value for run 1 run 2 and for all of the value these value be also plot alongside the individual emission line calculation for reference the accepted value for r∞ have be plot 1.09737316 × 10 7 m −1 1 the accepted value for r∞ do not lie within any of the range define by the calculate value uncertainty the emission spectrum of hydrogen use the equipment the experiment be run twice since a novel method for determine the centre of the emission line observe be developed after the first run of the experiment be complete the data from the first run be much less accurate and precise than those of the second run and this be clearly visible in figure 11. hence a the mean of the second data run be much more precise and accurate than that of the first this be select a the final value for the rydberg constant a calculate in this experiment unusually during data collection for the second repeat of the experiment an orange emission line be observe in the emission spectrum of hydrogen there do not exist an orange colour emission line the wavelength of this emission line be measure a 587.5 ± 0.3 nm confirm it a originate from sodium in a previous experiment use the same equipment the wavelength of the emission line from a sodium vapour lamp be record a 587.7 ± 0.4 nm and the wavelength of the emission line from a flame test of a nacl solution be record a 587.6 ± 0.4 nm the origin of this emission line be unknown a possible explanation could be out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp although this do seem to be an unlikely scenario for this experiment a visual grate spectrometer be use to make the measurement other spectrometer design exist such a a computer-aided grate spectrometer in which the eyepiece be replace with a detector array usually a ccd or cmos sensor the benefit of use a computer-aided spectrometer over a visual grate spectrometer have already be investigate 6 in this investigation it be found that there be no significant improvement or reduction in the uncertainty of the measurement when use a computer-aided spectrometer thus this experiment would not be improve through this suggestion however if the experiment be to be repeat again much more care should be take in align the spectrometer when carry out this experiment the spectrometer do not appear perfectly align before the first data set be record before the second data set be record the spectrometer be align much more carefully however the alignment be still not perfect it be hypothesise that the misalignment of the spectrometer explains the difference in accuracy between the two separate run of the experiment in order to far reduce the error in measure the angle of the maximum in the spectrum a diffraction grate with a high number of lines/mm could have be use such that the angle separate the order of the spectrum would be large thus the uncertainty in determine the small change in the angle on the vernier scale would have be far reduce combine with the `` in/out `` method of measurement developed the uncertainty could be reduce to an even well range more repetition of the experiment could improve the final mean value take for r ∞ a long a the spectrometer be correctly align when carry out the experiment it be important to make detailed note on the alignment procedure so that during data analysis it be possible to notice any issue that may have arisen,superficial,none
14,GS_LZH215_Redacted,abstract-the main aim of this experiment be to determine the value of the rydberg constant this be do by find the wavelength of the spectral line associate with the balmer series in a hydrogen atom this be found by use the principle of diffraction the spectral line be diffract through a diffraction grate in a grate spectrometer then by know the energy level transition associate with these spectral line and by use the rydberg formula for hydrogen atom the rydberg constant be calculate our measure value for the rydberg constant be 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value give a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 1 due to the small percentage error but an uncertainty which do n't include the accepted value with slight improvement this method can produce accurate and precise measurement for the rydberg constant however in it current state the procedure give result which do n't agree with the accepted value the main reason for this inaccuracy be that it be difficult to read the scale on the grate spectrometer a it be too small this be not help by the fact that we have to constantly squint our eye to try to read the value from the scale with only a very bright desk lamp over the scale if a digital grate spectrometer be use then the measurement would be much more accurate he bohr model of the atom describes negatively charge electron in orbit of a positively charge central nucleus at particular radius at these radius the electron only have discrete value of energy call energy level the electron can remain indefinitely in the energy level without emit radiation and lose energy if the electron be give the correct amount of energy they can jump to a high energy level if this occurs the electron be say to be excite energy can be transfer to the electron be several way include absorb a photon of electromagnetic radiation which have energy exactly equal to the difference between the two energy level if enough energy be give to the electron it will escape the electrostatic force of attraction of the positively charge nucleus and the atom will be ionise the rydberg constant be the wavenumber inverse wavelength of the photon of the low energy which will cause the ionisation of a hydrogen atom it be first use by swedish physicist johannes rydberg in 1890. it be one of the most accurately measure fundamental physical constant with accepted measure value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 ± 5.9x10 -10 1 however it can be express a a combination of other physical constant where me be the mass of an electron e be the charge of an electron h be plank constant c be the speed of light and ε0 be the permittivity of free space due to the number of fundamental physical constant which define the rydberg constant it be very important and powerful constant in particular it can be use to find the energy level within any atom of a know element this experiment will find a value for the rydberg constant by find the wavelength of spectral line use the principle of diffraction in the hydrogen vapour lamp be use a large potential difference be put across the hydrogen vapour this cause electron from the cathode at one end of the vapour tube to travel across it to the anode at the other end of the tube these electron collide with the electron in the hydrogen atom transfer energy to them this cause the electron in the hydrogen atom to gain more energy and thus move into a high energy level become excite the excite electron will eventually jump back to the ground state the low energy level this be call deexcitation the electron can jump to a low energy level by release a photon of electromagnetic radiation with energy equivalent to the difference between the energy level same energy of photon that would be require to excite the electron between the two energy level an excite electron can deexcite directly to the ground state or indirectly by descend to low energy level first this mean that lesser energy photon can be release by the de-excitation the energy of a photon e be dependent on it frequency f and be give by the relationship 𝐸 ℎ𝑓 2 where h be plank constant and have a value of 6.626070040 × 10 −34 j thus a electron de-excite many different wavelength of photon be produce which correspond to the different energy level transition measure the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer t for a hydrogen atom which have only one electron it have be observe that for all the transition to the second energy level the correspond photon for each transition have a wavelength in the visible light spectrum it can thus be observe these photon be call the balmer series this can be observe in the energy level diagram below in figure 1. if these photon in be refract through a prism an emission spectrum will be produce a show in figure 2 below each line of the spectrum be call a spectral line each line corresponds to different frequency of photon which be release in de-excitation and be in the visible light frequency range emission spectrum can also be produce with diffraction grate a diffraction grate be a plate with multiple parallel slit on it in grate spectrometer the photon release from the hydrogen lamp be direct into the spectrometer where they pa through the diffraction grate the photon passing through adjacent slit interact with each other cause constructive inference in some place and destructive interference in others produce a pattern see in figure 3 below the central beam be refer to a the zeroth order and be in the same direction a the incident ray the order increase with increase angle from the central beam the relationship between the order and the angle of it diffraction be sin 𝜃 𝑁𝜆𝑚 3 where θ be the angle of diffraction of the order angle of order relative to central beam n be the number of slit per metre on the diffraction grate λ be the wavelength of the photon and m be the order of the beam if a graph of sin θ against order m be plot the wavelength of the spectral line can be found by divide the gradient of the by the number of slit per metre in the diffraction grate n the graph produce should be a straight line with a positive gradient the rydberg constant 𝑅 can be calculate use the wavelength of the spectral line and the rydberg formula show below where λ be the wavelength of the photon emit n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level of the electron a we be measure balmer series spectral line the final energy level be always the second energy level so the formula can be manipulate to in this experiment we be use the red and blue spectral line a they be most prominent thus by look at figure 1 and figure 2 on the left we can see the red spectral line be due to the transition from 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level this be because the red spectral line have the high frequency low energy of all the visible spectral line produce thus we can also see the blue spectral line be due to the electron transition from the 4 th to the 2 nd energy level this be because the blue spectral line have the second high frequency second low energy of all the visible spectral line produce thus we set up the grate spectrometer a show in the lab manual except a sodium lamp be use to calibrate it and the main scale be in 0.5º in do so we ensure that the crosshair be rotate to the `` x `` positon the telescope be in focus with the image of the spectral line and the diffraction grate be perpendicular to the incident source this be show in figure 4 of the experimental setup we then place the hydrogen lamp in front of the slit on the grate spectrometer i look through the eye piece lens on the grate spectrometer and found the zeroth spectral line this be identify a the brightest spectral line which be about 180º with the lamp and have all the different wavelength spectral line overlap we record the angle of the zeroth order spectral line by turn the eyepiece lens such that the cross hair be in the middle of the spectral line this measurement be use a a reference measurement ø0 i then measure the angle ø of the red spectral line from order -4 to 4. be the positive order be those anticlockwise of the zeroth order and the negative order be clockwise of the zeroth order a show in the figure 5. this be then repeat by my lab partner and an average angle for each order be calculate we then calculate the relative angle of the spectral line to the zeroth order θ by subtract the angle of the zeroth order spectral line from the average angle of each order we then plot a graph of sin θ against the order for the red spectral line and measure the gradient of the best line of fit we then divide the gradient by the grate space to obtain the wavelength of the spectral line this be then repeat for the blue spectral line the value for the wavelength of the red spectral line be inputted into equation 6 to find a value of the rydberg constant the value for the wavelength of the blue spectral line be inputted into equation 7 to find another value of the rydberg constant these value be average to produce an average value for the rydberg constant from this method this be compare to the accepted value the graph produce from the red spectral line be show below in figure 6. this graph show a positive correlation between sin θ and the order of the beam the graph have a gradient of 0.0532 ± 0.0013. when this be multiply by the grate space 78.8 line per mm it be found the wavelength of the red spectral line be 6.756x10 -7 ± 1.68x10 -8 m. when this be inputted into equation 6 below it be found that the rydberg constant be 10657641.3 ± 265669.6 m -1 the graph produce from the blue spectral line be show this graph show a positive correlation between sin θ and the order of the beam the graph have a gradient of 0.0385 ± 0.0002. when this be multiply by the grate space 78.8 line per mm it be found the wavelength of the blue spectral line be 4.890x10 -7 ± 3.0x10 -9 m. when this be inputted into equation 7 below it be found that the rydberg constant be 10906793.3 ± 67911.9 m -1 when these value where average our measure value for the rydberg constant be 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value give a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 a we can see from both these graph the uncertainty in sin θ be small a the uncertainty in the measurement of θ be 2 3 ° this meant the uncertainty in sin θ be give by the expression the small uncertainty in sin θ lead to a small uncertainty in the wavelength of the spectral line λ give by the expression thus the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for each wavelength be give by the expression where n be the initial energy level thus the uncertainty in the average value of the rydberg constant be even though the uncertainty seem large it be relativity small when compare to the magnitude of the rydberg constant moreover our measure value have a small percentage error of 1.745 however our uncertainty do include the accepted value thus our measure value disagrees with the accepted value the aim of this experiment be to determine the rydberg constant this be do by find the wavelength of the spectral line associate with the balmer series we found this by the principle of diffraction a different wavelength of photon will diffract through a diffraction grate by different angle from this we measure the rydberg constant a 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value give a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 due to the small percentage error but an uncertainty which do n't include the accepted value with slight improvement this method can produce accurate and precise measurement for the rydberg constant however in it current state the procedure give result which do n't agree with the accepted value the main reason for this inaccuracy be that it be difficult to read the scale on the grate spectrometer a it be too small this be not help by the fact that we have to constantly squint our eye to try to read the value of the scale with only a very bright desk lamp over the scale if a digital grate spectrometer be use then the measurement would be much more accurate furthermore it be difficult to place the crosshair in the centre of the spectral line when it be rotate to the `` x `` position i feel it might have be easy to place the crosshair in the centre if it be rotate to the `` `` position this adjustment would try and use the vertical line of the `` `` to bisect the spectral line by move the telescope when the spectral line be bisect the crosshair would be in the middle of the spectral line moreover this inaccuracy could be due to the fact the hydrogen vapour lamp continued to overheat which cause the spectral line to slowly fade a the intensity of the spectral line decrease it become more difficult to see through the telescope and thus more difficult to take accurate reading this problem could be eliminate by use hydrogen vapour lamp with well cool we also consider the width of the spectral line a possible uncertainty however when we attempt to measure the width it be too small to measure with the scale on the grate spectrometer due to the fact the grate spectrometer be a very precise measure device the width of the spectral line be consider a negligible if a wider slit be use the spectral line would have be wider and thus the width may not have be negligible however this would have cause the sharpness and contrast of the line to be lose meaning it would have be more difficult to take accurate reading 1 http //ws680 nist.gov/publication/get pdf.cfm pub id=9206 87 2 http

15,GS_SZB587_Redacted,"we have use diffraction grate spectrometry to measure the wavelength of the spectral line of hydrogen and determine the rydberg constant we have found the spectral line to correspond to the balmer series with wavelength of 660±10 nm for the red light and 490± 6 nm for the green light we calculate the rydberg constant heavy nucleus in air which we found to be 1090 ± 10 × 10 4 m −1 our measurement be 0.637 off the currently accepted value of 10973731.56859 10 ±9 × 10 −10 m −1 for the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 off the calculate value of 10960797 ± 10 m −1 for the rydberg constant in air both accepted value be within our range of uncertainty t he rydberg constant relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of an atom during electron transition to the the number denote the energy level between which the electron transition rydberg measure this constant to be 107,921.6 cm -1 1 the rydberg be first measure experimentally by janne rydberg a a constant common to each spectral series for the hydrogen atom 1 however this constant also arises a a consequence of a fundamental quantum mechanical effect namely the quantisation of energy level of the atom by apply the quantum mechanical atomic model to the hydrogen atom and quantise it electron energy level niels bohr be able to derive the rydberg constant theoretically 2 therefore the calculation of the rydberg constant be not only of importance to spectrometry but to the verification of the quantum mechanical model of the atom propose by bohr contrary to rydberg 's initial assumption the actual value of the rydberg constant varies between element depend on the mass of their nucleus 1 however for element whose nucleus be much heavier than an electron the rydberg factor r ∞ be approximately constant the rydberg constant for heavy atom have be measure experimentally to a high accuracy to be r ∞ 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 -10 m -1 3 in this experiment we aim to measure the rydberg constant use diffraction grate spectrometry we will examine the spectral emission line of hydrogen through a grate spectrometer and consequently determine the wavelength of the emission line this will allow u to calculate a value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each wavelength we will then calculate a mean measurement of r h and use it to calculate r ∞ we compare our measure value to curently accepted value of the rydberg constant a well a discus the condition affect the constant such a the permittivity of free space the main apparatus use in this experiment be a grate spectrometer a hydrogen lamp be use to excite hydrogen atom in order to radiate light the grate spectrometer collimates light come from the source through the collimator and directs it through a diffraction grate each wavelength of light diffracts at a different angle thus we achieve a separation of the spectral line of hydrogen emission the angle at which the light ray be diffract be a periodic function of the wavelength a show in fig 2. the difference between the path of the light ray diffract at two adjacent slit distance d apart to the same point on a plane l away from the grate be then from fig 1 equal to r 1 − r 2 thus if the angle between the line connect the midpoint between the slit and the point on the plane of incidence be θ then if the slit separation d be small enough compare to separation of the plane l then r 2 r 1 be approximately true now a r 1 r 2 the path difference be therefore dsin θ assume d l and slit width d then θ θ which be the angular displacement between the consecutive order if the two light ray be to interfere constructively the path difference between them must be an integer multiple of the wavelength therefore where m be the order of maximum intensity and λ be the wavelength plot sine of the angular displace for each order against the order number we obtain a straight line whose gradient be λ/d and a we know the separation d we can calculate the value of λ for each spectral line the rydberg constant be an empirical constant calculate upon analyse the spectral line series of an element such a the balmer series for hydrogen emission spectrum 5 these series take the form where λ be the wavelength of radiation r ∞ be the rydberg constant for heavy element and n f and n i be integer characterise the spectral line and the series respectively 6 however the rydberg constant also arises when bohr 's quantum mechanical theory of the atom 1 be apply to the hydrogen atom 2 bohr 's derivation be base upon planck 's theory of the quantisation of radiation from an atom which state that atom only radiate energy which be integer multiple of a fundamental quantity this may be mathematically write a follow where e be the radiation energy ν be it 's frequency h be planck 's constant and n be an integer multiple 8 9 bohr 's model proposes that electron can exist in stable quantise circular 2 orbit around the atom without radiate energy where the centripetal force be provide by the coulomb attraction force therefore if an electron transition from a high energy n th i orbit to a low energy n th f orbit then by consider the energy of each orbit a the sum of the potential and kinetic energy of the electron the difference in energy between the orbit ∆e be then give by 3 where m e be the electron mass e be the electron charge 0 be the permittivity of free space and h be planck 's constant 10 a the difference in energy be equal to the frequency of radiation multiply by planck 's constant 8 where c be the speed of light in a vacuum and λ be the wavelength of radiation finally we get where with r ∞ be the rydberg constant for large nucleus a the ratio of the mass of the electron to the proton be too large compare to the accuracy of the measurement of the rydberg constant the ratio be approximately m p /m e 1836 11 the mass of the proton must be take into account when find the rydberg constant for hydrogen this be in order to account for the motion of the nucleus however all that be need to account for the difference be to replace the term m e with µ where µ be the reduce mass for the protonelectron system 12 where with m n be the mass of the proton or the nucleus thus our calculate value of rydberg constant becomes r h denotes the rydberg 's constant for the hydrogen atom which be in fact the value of rydberg constant we will measure from the gradient of the graph of our experiment to obtain the value of r ∞ we use the follow equation this experiment be perform use a spectrometer and hydrogen lamp light from the hydrogen lamp be pas through a light collimator which directs the light ray through the diffraction grate and into a telescope the spectrometer 's telescope be focus use an object 5 meter away to ensure sharpness of image a sodium lamp be use to align the collimator and telescope with the slit use the telescope 's cross-hair the width of the slit be chosen a a compromise between light intensity and sharpness of image the diffraction grate be then adjust to be perpendicular to the path of light between the collimator and telescope this be do by turn the telescope by exactly 90 degree from original alignment position with a mirror instead of the diffraction grate in place the mirror be then adjust until it be at exactly 45 degree to the telescope with the image from the mirror exactly at the centre of the cross-hair the mirror be then turn by 45 degree opposite to ensure it 's perpendicular to original align line of sight the mirror be then replace with the grate and telescope be turn back to original position the orientation of the grate in the vertical plane be also adjust by adjust the height and orientation of the grate stage so that the light ray pas exactly through the centre of the grate and appear in the centre of the telescope lens this be test by check that the image do not tilt or move up or down a the telescope be rotate the adjustment be do in order to prevent the diffract light ray from deviate vertically away from the plane of the telescope lens a well a tilt of the image which would increase uncertainty in it position another reason for ensure alignment be to prevent the light ray from hit the telescope at an angle to the horizontal plane which would reduce the accuracy of our approximate model in equation 2 a number of diffraction grate with different number of slit per millimetre be try to find the optimal grate to use for our experiment for each grate the angle between the first two maximum be measure a displayed in table 1. we settle on the 300 slit per millimetre grate a a compromise between have a suitable number of maximum per degree turn while each degree turn be itself large enough in order to reduce the uncertainty a well a have large enough resolve power for each spectral line the telescope be turn in both direction to measure the angle between the initial position and the maximum of each order a show in fig 2. for each maximum the angular width of the image appear in the telescope be measure twice by my lab partner and myself and the average width calculate to determine the uncertainty in our angular measurement for each wavelength we only take 5 measurement a beyond that the light be too dim to take any more accurate measurement of the angular displacement iv result 1 wavelength of spectral line a we plot sine of the angular displacement against the order the gradient of the graph be the wavelength λ divide by the slit width d. from fig 3 the gradient of the green line 0.148 ± 0.002 dimensionless the gradient of the red line 0.197 ± 0.003 dimensionless for each line the relationship between the gradient g and the wavelength follow the equation the width of each slit in the grate be 1/300 mm 3.33×10 −3 ± 1×10 −5 mm consequently the wavelength of the red light similarly the green light 's wavelength λ green be the uncertainty in each value of sin θ in term of θ where θ be the angular displacement be give by σ where with σ θ be the angular width of each maximum in our measurement for each colour σ θ be approximately constant for the red light σ θ 4 arc minute a measure by my lab partner and myself while for the green light σ θ 7 and 5 arc minute with a mean value of 6 arc minute this be all take into account when compute the error on the gradient 2 arc minute be also add in order to account for uncertainty in angle measurement on both edge of the image assume the error in the slit width and the error on the angular width of each maximum be linearly independent then the error on the wavelength σ λ be therefore give in term of the uncertainty in the gradient and in slit width σ g and σ d respectively through 2 rydberg constant calculation the wavelength of the light ray observe correspond more closely to the balmer series than to any other series 5 therefore n f to equal 2 while n i be 3 for red and 4 for green in equation 3 for the rydberg constant for red light n i 3 and n f 2. the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h be give by 4 use equation 3 the weight mean for r h be thus a discus in the theoretical section to find the rydberg constant for heavy nucleus r ∞ we use equation 11 with m e be the electron mass and m p be the proton mass the ratio m p /m e be experimentally measure to be 1836.152470 76 11 thus our calculate value of r ∞ be with a range of therefore our value of the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom and the rydberg constant for heavy element be indistinguishable due to the high uncertainty associate with each value the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 −10 m −1 which fall within our uncertainty range this mean our measure value have a mean percentage error of 0.638 4 all uncertainty calculation be include in the appendix our measure range of value for the rydberg constant agrees experimentally with the currently accepted value a it fall within our range however a number of random and systematic error that our uncertainty on the value be discus below the rydberg constant be a function of the permittivity of free space a discus in the theory section the permittivity of free space itself varies with pressure and humidity 13 therefore the permittivity of free space in our laboratory be different to the permittivity of free space in a vacuum upon which the accepted value of the rydberg constant be base the ratio of absolute permittivity of air to permittivity of a vacuum also know a relative permittivity be currently measure to be 1.00058986 ± 0.00000050 14 this mean that r ∞ in air at standard pressure and temperature be 5 this value be still within our range of expect value of r ∞ however the mean percentage error be reduce from 0.638 to 0.547 another major source of systematic uncertainty be background light presence of background light would cause the width of the observe image to be small a the eye becomes less sensitive to light this would force u to use a large slit width in order to increase brightness of image which would produce a less sharp image with large uncertainty in position it also meant that we could obtain few data point a the image become much dimmer for maximum of order high than 3 and less than -2. this assymetry in the data in itself suggests that background light from one direction be conceal the maximum at the order of -3. it also meant that we could not make any accurate measurement of the blue spectral line with n f =5 one blue spectral be observe at an angle of about -8 degree however the line be too dim to make any accurate measurement regard it position or to find any other blue spectral line theoretically the telescope have to be focus at infinity however we could only use a 5-metre-away object for focus due to the dimension and capacity of the laboratory room this meant that the telescope may have not be perfectly focus and a defocus aberration along the optical axis of the telescope might have occur this would mean that the image be stretch out with a large uncertainty in position while all care have be take to ensure the alignment of the spectrometer a discus in the method section small deviation from alignment would lead to light fall at a vertical angle to the telescopic lens from fig 1 the path of light would be shift vertically i.e out of the paper in the figure this mean light would travel a distance r 2 or r 1 plus some vertical distance k. the path difference δ thus becomes if k=0 this simply reduces to dsin θ for k not equal to zero the path difference approximation a dsin θ becomes less accurate if k or the vertical misalignment be comparable to the separation of the slit and the telescope the uncertainty due to this add approximate becomes significantly large our experiment be aim at measure the rydberg constant by analyse the balmer series for hydrogen use a diffraction grate spectrometer we measure the wavelength of two of the spectral colour of the series the wavelength of the red colour be measure to be 660 ± 10 nm while the wavelength of the green colour be measure to be 490 ± 6nm these value be use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom which we found to be 1090 ± 10 × 10 4 m −1 we then use bohr 's atomic model formula for rydberg 's constant and found that the difference between the rydberg constant for hydrogen and that for heavy element be small than we could detect due to the size of our uncertainty in measurement in angular displacement the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 −10 m −1 in a vacuum and 10960797 ± 11 m −1 in air thus imply a mean percentage error of 0.638 on our measurement compare to the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 compare to the rydberg constant in air we have also calculate the rydberg constant in air at standard temperature and pressure use value for rydberg constant and relative permittivity from literature 14 at 10960797 ±11m −1 both of these value fall within our range of uncertainty for the rydberg constant if the experiment be to be repeat the most significant improvement to be make be improve isolation from background light such a run the experiment in a dark room with no external light or cover the collimator cover the collimator with a dark cloth would prevent external light from appear with the image reduce background light would allow for the gathering of the blue spectral line data this data could then be use to determine another value for the rydberg constant and hence improve the accuracy of the mean value it would also allow for the gathering of more data point for high order which would lead to reduce uncertainty due to random error another improvement would be the use of a diffraction grate with a wider slit a it would create more maximum per angular displacement and more data point can be gather this would reduce the effect of random error however it would also reduce the resolve power of the grate and thus introduce another uncertainty in the position of the maximum a grate with 150 slit per mm could thus be a well compromise between resolve power and number of data point over the 300 slit per mm grate we use use the same type of diffraction grate spectrometry analyse the spectral line of various element could be use to verify the relationship between r ∞ and the mass of the nucleus in order to verify bohr 's atomic model 's accuracy a state in equation 8 the uncertainty on the wavelength be give by thus for red light the uncertainty be similarly the uncertainty in the green light 's wavelength be the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h a calculate use the red light 's wavelength be give by σ r where 2 the uncertainty on the weight mean for the rydberg constant for hydrogen σ r h be give by the sum of the inverse of the error square which bohr 's model assumes that electron rotate around the hydrogen nucleus in fix quantise orbit the electron do not radiate any energy less than the difference between the energy level they 're occupy and any other energy level a the electron be rotate in almost circular orbit the centripetal force f centripetal be supply by the coulomb attraction force and give by 12 where 0 be the permittivity of free space e be the charge of the electron or the proton and r be the radius of the orbit we then have where m e be the electron mass and v it 's velocity a the orbit be quantise the angular momentum l n of the n th orbit be therefore also quantise this mean that for each orbit the angular momentum be an integral multiple of the reduce planck constant h. therefore we have where r n be the radius of the orbit and v n be the velocity of the electron in the orbit 12 solve equation 35 and 36 for r n and v n we get and we can now use these expression to work out the total energye total the energy of the orbit be give in term of kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p by 12 which be this reduces to a n be an integral value characterise each orbit if the electron start at orbit with n n i and end on orbit with n= n f the difference in energy be then give by ∆e where the rydberg constant be give by 2 let r ∞ air be the rydberg constant in air while r ∞ be the rydberg constant in a vacuum while air be the permittivity of free space in air while 0 be the permittivity of free space in a vacuum from equation 44 the ratio of the permittivity of free space in air to that in a vacuum be know a the relative

separation d of the grate and the wavelength of the light a diffraction grate can split polychromatic light into it component colour this be very similar to the double slit experiment the main difference be the small slit separation of grate the major cause of the phenomenon of grate be diffraction the slight bending of light a it pas around the edge of an object the amount of bending depends on the wavelength λ of light and the slit separation d. if the separation be much large than wavelength the bending will be unnoticeable whereas if the wavelength be close in size or equal with the grate space there be considerable amount of bending which can be observe easily figure 1 a beam of white light be separate by the grate 2 the grate can be consider a many small slit with

photon emit when electron transition between those level the rydberg constant be a proportionality constant between these variable 2 it be important that an accurate value of this constant be measure so that physicist can calculate the wavelength of photon emit when electron transition within an atom know the number of energy level they move through in the experiment light from a hydrogen lamp be shone through a 300 line per mm diffraction grate and the spectrometer be use to find different emission line the angle of the emission line relative to the zero-order fringe be then measure allow the wavelength of the light to be calculate the rydberg constant can then be determine from the rydberg equation a diffraction grate consists of a series of equally space parallel narrow slit when white light be shone through the grate it diffracts through each slit and interferes with light diffract through other slit the result be a series of alternate bright and dark fringe with each bright fringe except for the central fringe form a spectrum of visible light a each frequency of light diffracts at different angle the angle of each bright fringe to the normal be define by where m be the order of

level electron transition from the third energy level or high down to the second energy level emit photon with energy equal to the energy change in the transition 2 this mean electron at different

iii method the equipment be set up a in figure 1. before the experiment be undertaken the spectrometer be set up so that clear focus image could be see to reduce eye strain the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire the camera lens be then focus on an determination of the rydberg constant i object position 5-10 m away until no parallax be see between the cross wire and the object the telescope be subsequently align with the collimator and the hydrogen lamp be turn on i position the hydrogen lamp ~1cm from the slit so that the image would be bright then look through the telescope i change the focus of the collimator until a sharp image of the slit be see centre at the crosswire finally the slit width be decrease to ensure a great diffraction of light so that a sharper emission line would

myself both measure the angle and set the average of our reading a the 0 point this be to reduce the error in the reading and to give u a valid method of calculate the error we then repeat this method of measurement for the emission line and use the difference between the angle of the emission line and the angle of the incident beam a the diffraction angle in total 3 colour be visible-red green and

by the slit separation λ be determine this can then be use in equation 2 to get a value of the rydberg constant 3 therefore 3 value of the rydberg constant be obtained-1 for each colour an average value be calculate from the 3 value to reduce the error on the result i identify 3 major source of systematic error in the experiment there would clearly be uncertainty due to the resolution of the vernier scale ᵒ due to the fact there be uncertainty in the 0 position and the final measure value there would also be some uncertainty due to the thickness of the emission line which we measure to be ᵒ however because this be small than the resolution error it will not factor into the analysis finally error would be create through the difficulty in see the emission lines-this effect be bad for the

calculate gradient of 0.19921648 and 0.1325 respectively however the software be unable to produce error for these gradient a i only manage to obtain 2 result each for these colour meaning a covariance matrix could not be form to calculate the error i plot the steepest and shallowest possible line of best fit passing through all the error bar on figure 3 and 4. i then determine the error a where g be the steepest possible line of best fit gradient and g be the shallowest possible line of best fit gradient use equation 6 i obtain an error of ±0.054 for red and ±0.045 for purple the error in the wavelength can then be calculate use where σλ be the error in the wavelength and σ gradient be the error in the gradient the error in the rydberg constant for each colour can then be

and green light respectively the final result i obtain be r ∞ 1.069±0.151 ×10 7 m -1 the theoretical value be 1.097×10 7 m -1 1 which be within the uncertainty range of the measure value suggest the measure value be accurate however the error on it be very large it be evident that this large error be cause by the large error in the gradient of the red and purple light which be cause by the method of error analysis i use for these colour this would also explain why the error for the red and purple light be so much large than the green light despite the error bar on figure 2,3 and 4 look relatively consistent-although a large error would be expect a there be few result for red and purple this lack of result be cause by the hydrogen lamp overheat and dim after we measure the green line meaning by the time we measure the red and purple emission line only the 1 st order fringe be visible this could have be prevent by measure all the 1 st order fringe together and all the 2 nd order fringe together ideally the experiment could have also go on for longer which would have allow time for the hydrogen lamp to cool and be reuse to measure the 2 nd order fringe for the red and purple emission line another problem with the experiment be the light generate by other group lamp which make the emission line harder to see the error generate by this will be account for in equation 3 this could be correct by repeat the experiment with no other group present the large source of error be likely to come from the difficulty in see the emission line and possible parallax in measure the vernier scale this be highlight by the fact the error calculate from equation 3 be mostly large than the resolution error for each data set the aim of the experiment be to calculate a value for the rydberg constant this be do by use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer to measure the diffraction angle of hydrogen balmer line this allow λ to be calculate and subsequently a value for the rydberg constant to be obtain the average value of the rydberg constant i produce be r ∞ 1.069±0.151 ×10 7 m -1 the theoretical value of 1.097×10 7 m -1 be within the uncertainty range of the average measure value this suggests the result be accurate which will be because of the high-resolution vernier scale use a well a the procedure take to ensure a focus sharp image be produce such a place the hydrogen lamp ~1cm from the slit which be narrow a much a possible however the value have a large associate error which will be primarily due to the fact the hydrogen lamp be dim and overheat when the purple and red line measurement be make this meant only the 1 st order fringe of each be visible meaning a different method of error analysis be need for the red and purple light which yield large error to improve the experiment it could be repeat in a completely dark room with no other group and with enough time to obtain more result for red and purple light",extended,bal

experiment be that a diffraction grate allows more light to pa through and the maximum occur when they be all constructively interfere meaning the maximum be much brighter a see in figure 2. the phase difference between neighbour ray be give by the fraction of the wavelength displace multiply by 2π where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the light ray since the phase difference be an integer multiple m of 2π we can write the above equation a from the inset in figure 1 the path difference can be write a 𝑑 sin 𝜃 where d be the distance between neighbour slit and 𝜃 be the angle move through from the axis of the collimator therefore the equation becomes mλ 𝑑 sin 𝜃. to find the wavelength a graph of sin 𝜃 against m can be plot and the value of the gradient will be λ the wavelength can be found by multiply the gradient by the slit separation how the wavelength relates to the rydberg constant will be outline in theory section ii transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by the formula where n represent the initial energy state of the atom p represent the final energy state of the atom and 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant for this experiment the balmer series will be use because it be in the visible part of the spectrum and can measure the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer t be observe use a spectrometer in this series p=2 which mean that the will drop down from the n th to the second energy level and the difference in energy will give off a photon of a specific wavelength the value of n can be determine by look at the measure value of the wavelength this be due to the planck-einstein relation which state that 𝐸 ℎ𝑓 or 𝐸 ℎ 𝑐 𝜆 where e be the difference in energy h be planck 's constant f be the frequency and c be the speed of light in a vacuum from this we can see that the difference in energy be inversely proportional to the wavelength and therefore the small difference in energy from n=3 to p=2 will correspond to the big wavelength use the measure value of the wavelength and the correspond value of n the rydberg constant can be calculate use the rydberg formula the first step be to set up the spectrometer so it be properly align and focus this be imperative for accurate and precise measurement the eyepiece be focus so that an object around 5 metre away be focus on the cross wire the telescope camera lens and eyepiece be align with the axis of the collimator and a sodium lamp be switch on and position close behind the slit a sodium lamp be use for the set up because it can be switch on for longer than hydrogen and allows for all set-up measurement to be make the focus of the collimator be adjust so that a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire the reading of the vernier scale be take so a `` 0° `` angle be note a see in table 1. the telescope be move through 90° and a mirror be insert in the diffraction grate holder the grate table be turn back until a reflect image of the slit in the mirror be see through the eyepiece which meant that the grate surface be at 45° to the incident beam from the collimator this angle be note the grate table be then move again through precisely 45° so it be accurately set at a new `` 0° `` normal incidence this angle will be use a the zero point for all measurement the mirror be replace with a diffraction grate and the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp finally the spectral line be observe through the telescope to ensure the spectrometer be set up correctly two different diffraction grate be use to observe the spectral line in the preliminary measurement one be approximately 78.8 line per mm and the other be 300 line per mm it be see that the different order line be much more disperse in the 300 line per mm a see in figure 4 and be of high intensity meaning that individual spectral line be much clearer and more distinct from other line when use the 300 line per mm grate this grate be kept in the holder and be use for the rest of the experiment another observation be that there be only three colour red aqua and blue that be clear enough to measure and that spectral line with order great than two be extremely difficult to measure therefore data be take for these three colour with order m=-2 to m=2 in addition the zero th order spectral line be in the same position for each colour so one measurement be sufficient for all colour intermittently an array of unusual colour be see through the eyepiece cause by desk lamp switch on and off around the room a a result the spectrometer be shield from external light use black card and the hydrogen lamp be move closer to the slit the centre of each spectral line for the three colour from m=-2 to m=2 be measure by each lab partner to reduce human error and to give a value for the statistical `` 0° `` angle 168° 44 `` 90° `` angle 78° 44 `` 45° `` angle 340° 58 new `` 0° `` angle 169° 04 e=hf e=hf uncertainty however a big source of be the width of the spectral line because 𝜃 could lie anywhere within that width accord to the bohr model spectral line should not have thickness because the value for energy be discrete however due to various effect broadening of spectral line occur effect such a natural broadening pressure broadening and opacity broadening can all increase the line thickness but the most considerable broadening in the visible spectrum be due to thermal doppler broadening 1 this be when hydrogen gas be hot so atom move with different velocity and therefore have different frequency due to the doppler shift this then result in a wider range of frequency and broadens the spectral line the only way to reduce this would be to cool hydrogen gas to very low temperature which be not possible for this experiment consequently the start and end of each spectral line be also measure and average to find the uncertainty of the angle a graph of sin 𝜃 against m be plot for the three colour red aqua and blue the width of the spectral line be measure to be 0.3° 1s.f so the uncertainty in the angle be ±0.2° 1s.f the uncertainty in the gradient be calculate by plot a graph of maximum gradient and minimum gradient for each colour and then calculate half of the difference between them this be carry through to the error in wavelength where the fractional error of the gradient and the slit separation would have be add in quadrature however error in the slit separation if any would be extremely small a the slit separation be approximately 3 × 10 −6 so this error be deem negligible therefore the fractional error of the gradient be simply multiply by the wavelength to obtain the uncertainty in the wavelength compare these value to the know value a see in figure 6 they be fairly accurate and within the range of the uncertainty this show that the correct error be account for this be far discus in the latter part of this section see a the wavelength for red be the large and the wavelength for blue be the small it can be infer from the planck-einstein relation that for red n=3 for aqua n=4 and for blue n=5 substitute this into the rydberg formula the follow result be achieve table 3. result for the rydberg constant for red aqua and blue spectral line and the calculate average rydberg constant the error in the rydberg constant for each colour be calculate use the derivative of the rydberg formula multiply by the error of the wavelength the follow formula be use where 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ be the error in the rydberg constant and 𝜎 𝜆 be the error in the wavelength the fractional error of the rydberg constant for the three colour be then add in quadrature to obtain the error for the average rydberg constant therefore the final value for the rydberg constant be 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f this differs from the know value of 10973731.6 m -1 which be approximately 100000 m -1 less than the value found in this experiment the know value be within the uncertainty meaning that the error be account for the difference be most likely due to the wrong angle of the spectral line be measure a only the midpoint of a range of angle be note down however the gradient wavelength red 0.196±0.002 653±7nm aqua 0.145±0.002 482±7nm blue 0.129±0.002 430±7nm difference could also be due to human error when reading the angle off the vernier scale the angle could be interpret differently by separate people because where the vernier scale aligns with the main scale can be difficult to see also the aqua blue colour at high order become very faint and be much harder to place at the crosswire which may have result in slightly erroneous measurement this result have a percentage error of 2.7 which be very high see the equipment use be extremely precise the value of this error come from the measure value of the width of the spectral line which be 0.3° this width could not be decrease a it be due to local condition around the element which be uncontrollable with the available resource therefore this be the best precision possible to improve more advanced technology could be use to decrease the spectral line broadness and find more precise value for wavelength and the rydberg constant the fact that all three value for the rydberg constant be high than the know value suggests a systematic error this could have be due to several effect some more likely than others least likely would be spectrometer misalignment and defocus because the setup and preliminary check be do carefully and rigorously however a calibration error may have be overlook there may have be an error in the diffraction grate such a too little or too many line however this be also unlikely a they be of professional quality the lamp position and background light do affect the experiment initially but solution to these problem be quickly found the solution may have be inadequate but the position of spectral line would not have be affected by this greatly most likely be temperature air pressure and humidity which may have shift frequency and make them large meaning the centre of the spectral line measure may have give a small wavelength and therefore a large rydberg constant overall the aim of the experiment be to calculate the value of the rydberg constant the method use involve measure the angle of hydrogen spectral line and calculate the wavelength by use path difference and phase difference formula and plot a graph from this the rydberg constant be calculate use the rydberg formula and the constant be found to be 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f this value be accurate but not very precise when compare to the know value of 10973731.6 m -1 the lack of precision be cause by the broadness of the spectral line which increase the uncertainty and may have cause systematic error to improve more consideration can be take to reduce the thickness of the spectral line and well evaluation of potential systematic error can be make overall the experiment calculate the rydberg constant accurately because the know value be within the range of the measure value and successfully demonstrate many aspect of spectroscopy,expert,bal

wavelength for this report 'blue will refer to transition 4 → 2 and 'dark blue/purple will refer to transition 5 → 2 a show in figure 1. light from a lamp be aim through a single slit before be collimate through a lens/collimator the light be then disperse through the grate before be refocus through the camera to the eyepiece the eyepiece could then be rotate to observe the position of different fringe the angle through which the light be bent and thus the position of each fringe depend on the width of the slit in the grate related in equation 2. for the repeatability of result and proper calibration the follow apparatus set-up procedure be follow the eyepiece and the crosshair be align and focus on an object around 5m away to eliminate parallax between the image and crosshair the telescope compose of the camera lens and eyepiece be angle so that it be parallel with the collimator the collimator focus be then alter to give an image of maximum clarity the telescope be then rotate through exactly 90° a measure on the angular scale the grate be place in it holder on the turntable of the spectrometer and adjust so that the collimate light pas through it the grate use be 78.8 line per mm the turntable be then rotate until a reflect image of the entrance slit be directly behind the crosshair give an angle of exactly 45° which be record before the turntable be rotate through exactly 45° thus set to 0° rotate in either direction from this zero reference allow angular position of fringe to be determine with rotation in opposite direction have opposite sign define one direction a positive meant reading could take both side of zero give more data with which to plot a graph thus reduce uncertainty in the gradient of each graph the fringe number and colour with it associate angular displacement be record in degree and arc minute for each fringe these value be then convert to radian before a graph of sin θ m against m be plot for each colour give gradient a λ d a d represent the distance between slit which be the inverse of line density of the grate the wavelength of the fringe could be calculate use equation 4 r h can then be found from equation 2 it be clear that a graph of sin θ m against fringe order m should show a linear relationship both red and blue plot show this after plot the blue result figure 4 it be notice that all point have a similar gradient but there be a step in value between the m=0 and m=1 fringe this imply incorrect label of fringe number by change point m=1,2 to point m=2,3 respectively the far more concordant graph be plot show in figure 5. the difference become even more apparent on plot the residual of the original and correct plot a in figure 6. the variance of the correct residual be 7 time small than that of the uncorrected plot 2.81×10 −5 v 1.97×10 −4 strongly improve quality of the line of best fit and the final result fig 6 residual for both blue plot calculate by subtract y coordinate of each point from the position of the line of best fit at that same point from the gradient of these figure the wavelength of red fringe be calculate a 661 ± 8 nm consistent with table i and the blue wavelength be calculate a 510 ± 20 nm meaning the accepted value be narrowly outside the range of experimental uncertainty the value of r h be determine a 1.09±0.01 ×10 7 m −1 use the calculate red wavelength and 1.05 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 use the calculate blue wavelength give a final value of 1.07 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 meaning the accepted value of 1.10×10 7 m −1 1 be within range of the experimental error of the calculate result a major shortcoming of this study be an insufficient number of result for dark blue/purple fringe allow only two value for r h to be found this difficulty be probably due to the closeness of first order fringe simply masking/blurring the position of individual fringe this mean that there be so much overlap between fringe it be hard to identify where one fringe end and another begin a way to reduce this effect in the future would be to use a grate with a great line density reduce slit separation d. from equation 2 it be see that would increase the value of sin θ m for each give fringe which for an angle 90°would also be an increase in θ m with each colour spread out by a different angle due to different wavelength this would mean less fringe overlap and well fringe identification a large assumption in the result be the allocation of error the manufacturer-stated uncertainty of the grate spectrometer be impressively small a little a three part in ten thousand 8 the uncertainty in the fringe position be in fact much great than this a the position of the centre of a give fringe be subject to the judgement of the equipment operator this be because the fringe be not a precisely locate extremely small line but a bright section of differ intensity thus error associate with fringe angle be far great than the minimum uncertainty of the spectrometer for the purpose of error bar on our result a modest estimate be use this be found by measure the width of a large fringe a the centre must be contain within the full width of the fringe a large fringe be chosen a use a small fringe could have be an underestimate for large fringe whereas use a large fringe give an overestimate for small fringe it be more responsible to use the overestimate this be quote a the error for every fringe ±0.6° give ±0.01 for uncertainty in sin θ m although this be n't an accurate way of assign uncertainty time constraint do not allow u to take a reading for every fringe thus more advanced error analysis be not available to u it be also large enough to encompass aforementioned error such a that associate with the spectrometer itself and the discrepancy between r h and r ∞ a more suitable way of assign error in the future would involve take two value for each fringe the small and great angle at which the fringe can be see the mean of which give the value to be record this give a more appropriate value for each fringe and particularly for small fringe should reduce uncertainty give a more accurate determination of r h it be worth mention that the value for r h a calculate use only the red fringe be both more accurate and precise than the final value average both the blue and red value with error combine in quadrature this show how remarkably less accurate the blue fringe be than the red this may due to an observational error in result confusion of colour a show in figure 1 the purple/dark blue and light blue fringe appear much more similar than either do with the red consequently it may be true that one or more of the 'blue point in figure 5 belong on a different graph in the future clearly identify colour at the start of the experiment could reduce uncertainty in the result by provide a whole extra set of purple/dark blue data and reduce variance from line of best fit in blue result this could be do by calculate the theoretical angle at which a fringe of each colour would be see use data in table i with equation 2. the telescope could then be adjust to this position and the colour at/nearest this point identify a that colour from table i for future reading all these improvement rely on more time for completion of the experiment a set-up of the equipment take up a large portion of the available time improve the efficiency of set up the equipment would allow more reading to be take increase accuracy in determine value of r h the aim of the experiment be to find an accurate value for the rydberg constant by analysis of the hydrogen emission spectrum use a grate spectrometer upon calculation of the wavelength of two different set of colour fringe and comparison to the balmer series two value for r h be found use the balmer equation vary degree of accuracy and approximately determine error limited reliability however the final result be both accurate and precise with the accepted value 1.10 × 10 7 m −1 within the range of uncertainty of the empirical value 1.07 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 in the case of this experiment be repeat a few simple improvement described in this report should be implement include a well

order take for each visible balmer line be five however some order be not visible such a m= -5 for red very few order be visible for balmer gamma which be see a a violet colour many of the violet fringe be dim and the position could not be determine accurately therefore the position of the fringe be take a approximation which result in a high uncertainty for the value of 𝜃. only two negative order fringe be visible for balmer gamma however the number of positive order slit which could be see be up to m 5. the size of the collimator slit be make to be quite large to increase the intensity of the fringe visible so they could be see clearly and to allow measurement of up to five positive and negative order to be take however this result in a large fringe width the fringe could no longer

fringe width cause the high uncertainty in the calculation of the wavelength of the balmer line of hydrogen and 𝑅 ∞ therefore for future experiment the hydrogen lamp should be allow to cool for longer period of time between measurement so that the intensity of the visible fringe increase and the position of the fringe can be take more accurately a strong intensity hydrogen lamp should also be use so that the collimator slit size can be reduce and therefore the uncertainty due to the fringe width the experiment should also be conduct in a completely dark room to reduce the uncertainty due to the background light another suggestion for a more accurate measurement of 𝑅 ∞ would be to use a computer-aided diffraction grate spectrometer 1 the aim of the experiment be to measure the hydrogen balmer series and to calculate the value of the rydberg constant r∞ use a diffraction grate spectrometer three line of the balmer series balmer alpha beta and gamma be observe however the fourth line

multiple order be take on both side of the zero order and this be use to find a wavelength for each colour use equation 2 before take any measurement use the grate spectrometer it first have to be align and focus this be do use a sodium lamp when a lamp be require we first ensure that there be no parallax between the image and cross hair by focus the eyepiece and camera lens then the telescope be align to the normal by first find the reflect image of the entrance slit after place the diffraction in the holder then the telescope be move by 45 degree and the angle be note a this be normal incidence and where the zero order should be finally the height of the image be adjust use the grate screw to ensure the image be at the right height for measurement and be not tilt which would affect the reading the setup can be see in figure 1 below figure 1 the figure above show the basic setup of the grate spectrometer where light come in from the source to the left the hydrogen lamp in this experiment the light pas through the collimator and then through the diffraction grate where it diffracts and the spectral line can be see through the telescope rotate the telescope clockwise show the negative order spectral line and the positive order line can be see by rotate the telescope anti-clockwise collimator telescope positive order after note down the zero order angle the hydrogen lamp be use to obtain the first set of reading we decide that reading on both side of the zero order would be take to reduce the uncertainty in the experiment one set of positive and negative order measurement for one colour would be take by me and then the lamp would be allow to cool the second set of reading for the same colour would be take by my partner after the lamp be consider cool enough for use this process be use to obtain measurement for all three colour this ensure that any systematic error or bias when reading the scale due to a single person reading the scale would not carry over in the analysis of the result and into the final conclusion if the hydrogen lamp be switch on for long period of time it produce very blurry line to prevent this from affect measurement the lamp be switch off periodically and allow to cool when take measurement of the different colour and their respective order the centre of these band be difficult to determine and can easily produce large uncertainty this meant that our method of determine the angle have to be change and so we chose to select the edge of the band closest to zero order and use this a our reference point for each colour and order the angle that be collect in the measurement for each order and colour be then subtract from the zero order angle for each respective measurement and this angle be θ for each different order which be then substitute into equation 2 where d be 1/78800 the diffraction grate have 78.8 line per mm so d be 1/lines per m this result in multiple wavelength for each colour red purple and blue so

graph have a gradient of -9.846x10 6 ± 5.14x10 -2 and the intercept be 1.513x10 5 ± 1.583x10 -7 from this we can deduce the rydberg constant r ꚙ to be 9.846x10 6 m -1 this be different from the commonly accepted value of 1.09678x10 7 m -1 and it could be due to multiple reason one reason could be that the measurement of the angle be not perfect and that there be inaccurate reading due to human error another possible cause could be the wrong alignment and focus of the grate spectrometer which could result in reading that be far from accurate a final cause for the discrepancy could be that due to the slightly blur line in the purple spectral line the edge be not a definitive a it be for the other colour and this could likely affect our reading and the error could propagate when

±82490m −1 thus the true value 10,973,731.6 m −1 fall just outside the estimate margin of error the experimental process involves set up a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp in order to determine the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission spectrum in this experiment wavelength value for the red and blue spectral line be calculate each of these value be then combine with the knowledge of the balmer series and use in rydberg 's equation to get two separate value for r∞ one for each colour these value be then average to give the final value for r∞ t he rydberg constant r ∞ be a constant that appear in rydberg 's equation which predicts the wavelength of spectral light a a result of electron move between energy level in an atom when an element 's gaseous state be heat atom will absorb energy result in electron be excite and move from low energy state to high one when these electron de-excite back down to low energy level they release photon of specific energy correspond to the atom 's energy level because of this each element have a distinct spectral fingerprint this discovery form the basis of the study of spectroscopy this lab report describes an experiment which u a diffraction grate spectrometer to measure r ∞ the experiment first involves carefully set up the collimator grate and eyepiece so that the slit image be focus precisely at the cross wire inside the telescope once this be do the eyepiece be turn through various angle to look for spectral line the angle at which the spectral line occur be measure use a vernier scale built into the spectrometer table the angle and the order associate with each of the colour line be then record and compile to produce a dataset which can be graph in python a sin θ vs. order m for each colour the gradient of each graph be equal to λ d where d be the slit separation of the grate thus the value of λ can be obtain by multiply the value of the gradient by d. this value for λ be then substitute into rydberg 's equation to calculate r ∞ for that colour these value of r ∞ can then be average to obtain a final value for r ∞ the rydberg constant a mention in section i appear in rydberg 's equation which relates the wavelength of spectral line λ to the integer energy level of the initial and final energy state of the atom n and p respectively r ∞ be calculate by work out the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission spectrum and substitute the value into rydberg 's equation to understand how the emission spectrum for hydrogen be produce we must consider an important piece of apparatus for the experimentthe hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be essentially a long tube with two electrode on each end fill with hydrogen gas when a large potential difference be apply between the two electrode electron from the circuit be accelerate through the gas from one electrode to the other a the electron flow through the tube some of them may collide with atomic electron in the hydrogen gas 1 to understand the physic of what happens at this stage we can use the bohr model of the atom in the bohr model electron travel in circular orbit around the nucleus the energy of these orbit be proportional to the electron 's distance from the nucleus -the far the electron the high the energy most importantly the model state that the only stable orbit allow for the electron be those in which the electron 's angular momentum be an integer multiple h. thus electron can only orbit at discrete distance from the nucleus -orbits be quantize these quantize orbit be more commonly know a energy level and they be specific to each element 2 fig 1. the bohr model of the hydrogen atom show the electron tranisions represent the lymer blamer and paschen series now when an accelerate circuit electron with enough energy collides with the atomic electron in the energy level the atomic electron will absorb energy equal to that of the energy difference between two energy level this will excite the electron to that high energy level the excite electron will then de-excite back down to a low energy level and in the process emit a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the two energy level here be the key point -as each element have specific energy level only certain wavelength of light can be produce for each element more specifically only light of wavelength hc e where e be the energy difference between the two energy level will be emit from the lamp these specific frequency of light make up the emission spectrum for the element in the case of the hydrogen lamp the light emit from the lamp be only compose of frequency correspond to hydrogen 's emission spectrum however one of the key part of the experiment involves actually work out what the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission spectrum be in order to do this we need to use another key bit of apparatus -a diffraction grate use this we need to find a formula which relates the wavelength of the line to other feature of the apparatus such a the angle through which the telescope be turn this equation can be derive in the follow manner a diffraction grate can be thought of a a large number n of equally space narrow slit with slit separation d. for light of wavelength λ a principal maximum occurs when the phase difference between the two ray be an integer multiple m of 2π from fig 1. we can see that the path difference between two light ray be d sin θ thus where m be know a the order number thus if we gain a set in 1885 swiss physicist johann balmer deduce by trial and error that the wavelength of light spectrum emit by hydrogen atom follow the relationship where r be a constant which be now know a the rydberg constant r ∞ 3 however balmer suggest that this relationship could be generalise and it take swedish physicist johannes rydberg in 1889 to find the general formula now know a rydberg 's formula where n p for the hydrogen atom p 2 corresponds to the balmer series other series have also be calculate such a the ultraviolet lyman series for p 1 and the infrared paschen series for p 3 however these be less important for this experiment a none of these series produce visible emission line for the balmer hydrogen series there be 4 main emission line the red line h α corresponds to n 3 the turquoise/green line h β corresponds to n 4 the blue line h γ corresponds to n 5 and the purple/indigo line h δ corresponds to n 6 4 fig 3. the line spectrum for hydrogen depend on which colour line be see the appropriate value of n and p 2 should be use in rydberg 's equation this can then be combine with correspond value of λ to calculate r ∞ the setup for this experiment be imperative to it overall success and accuracy so we a take a lot of time to make sure the apparatus be prepared correctly fig 4. show the set up use for this experiment first we need to focus the telescope eyepiece and camera lens the telescope be turn such that it point at a pencil case roughly 5-10 metre away with an unobstructed view without the diffraction grate in place on the table the focus be do in two stage first the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire which be a `` × `` locate inside the telescope by slide the eyepiece in and out until the cross wire be a dark and sharp a possible next the actual camera lens be focus this involve adjust the focus knob on the side of the telescope until the distant pencil case be in sharp focus however just do this will not achieve the correct focus because parallax have n't be consider the way we eliminate parallax be by make use of the cross wire we look through the telescope so we could see both the focus image of the cross wire and the other spectrometer by move our head left and right we saw that the cross wire and the spectrometer move back and forth in sync i.e one do n't move faster than the other this told u that the whole telescope be fully focus and that there be no parallax between the image and the cross wire now that the telescope be fully focus the focus knob on the telescope be not move for the remainder of the experiment after this we need to focus the collimator first the telescope be roughly align with the collimator at this point in a usual spectrometry experiment the light would be turn off an the focus would be test use a hydrogen lamp source however the manufacturer of the lamp recommend that the hydrogen lamp should be switch of every 30 second to prevent the lamp overheat see a the focus of the collimator take considerably longer than 30 second just for this part of the experiment a sodium lamp be use in it place the advantage of use a sodium lamp be that it could be kept switch on all the time the lamp be place close behind the collimator and without change the focus on the camera lens the focus knob on the collimator be adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire a with the previous part the next part of the setup involve align the diffraction grate with the collimator such that the grate be normal to the collimator first we use the previous setup in which the telescope and collimator be align and the telescope be focus on the sodium lamp we then lock the spectrometer table so the table ca n't move and take an angle reading use the verier angle scale due to the fact that the vernier scale on the spectrometer be very small we use a magnify glass to read all our measurement this particular magnify glass use have a bonus feature of double a a torch which make it possible to see the scale in the dark the measurement take be 221 • 38 next we subtract 90 • from this value and move the telescope to that exact value of 131 • 38 then we lock the telescope in place and unlocked the table so that the grate be free to rotate independently of the telescope and collimator afterwards the table be turn until the slit image be see through the telescope which indicate that the grate be roughly at 45 • to both the telescope and collimator to get the image exactly focus on the cross wire we make use of the slow motion drive a knob that move the table very slowly and precisely to make very small adjustment so that the image fell exactly on the cross wire once this be achieve we take a reading at this point of 80 • and add the 45 • back that that the grate be at an angle of 125 • now that grate be normal to the collimator the table be lock and not change for the remainder of the experiment the sodium lamp be then replace with the hydrogen lamp and the remainder of the experiment could begin we start by try to identify colour we saw in the emission spectrum have already study the emission spectrum for hydrogen we knew that there be 4 possible colour red turquoise blue and purple for this experiment the most visible and abundant colour be red and blue we in fact do n't see any turquoise or purple line at all to start with we focus the cross wire on the central maximum or 0th order line which be measure to be at 125 • then start with the red emission line we turn the telescope to the right until our cross wire focus on it 's first red line use the vernier scale we then record the angle measurement use the magnify glass for that line and name it the 1st order maximum m=1 the angle measurement data be then add to a table of order m and angle on the vernier scale θ next we continued to move the telescope to the right until we saw the next red line m 2 and again take the angle reading and add it to the table we continued this process by turn the telescope to the right until we could see no more we then turn the telescope back to the central maximum and repeat this process for by move the telescope to the left in this case we simply call the first line we saw m -1 and the second line m -2 and so on with negative integer this process be then repeat for the blue line and a set of data be obtain relate the scale reading on the vernier scale to the order of the maximum for both the red and blue spectrum line in order to work out lambda for both the red and blue line we need to make two graph of sinθ v m. however the θ in this case be should not be the reading on the vernier scale but should be the angle of the spectral line relative to the central line thus for each reading of θ on the scale we have to take away 125 • to obtain the correct set of value θ co then we could work out sinθ co and plot this against the order number m. one option would be to plot this data by hand however a the range of angle gain be small roughly 20 • for each colour and because we take the measurement to 4 decimal place we decide to plot the graph on python use the sp.polyfit function we have 3 main advantage over draw by hand the function ensures that we can draw a perfect least square line regression line it allows u to perfectly work out the gradient of this line again something we would add error into when find dy and dx and it also automatically work out error bar and gradient value this would prove extremely useful when do uncertainty calculation once the data have be compile and the graph be draw on python we could read off the gradient value for each of the two colour each of the gradient value be then multiply by the slit separation d. the number of line per unit length state on the diffraction grate be 80 slit per millimetre however the diffraction grate in fact u an old definition in imperial unit of 2001 line per inch this can therefore be approximate a 78.8 line per millimetre thus the slit separation d 1.269 × 10 −5 for each colour we then use the appropriate value of n and p from the balmer series the balmer series state that the red line come from transition of electron from the 3rd to the 2nd energy level -thus n 3 for red spectral line by the same reason n 5 for blue spectral line by definition the balmer series be for when p 2 thus p 2 for both colour finally the value of n p and λ be plug into the rydberg equation and a value of r ∞ be obtain for each colour both value be then average to get a final value for r ∞ the final result obtain forr ∞ from this experiment be 1.089 × 10 7 ± 82490m −1 therefore the standard accepted value of 10,973,731.6m −1 lie just outside the margin of error a table of the data represent the result for the red emission line angle be show in table i and the result for the blue emission line angle be show in table ii table iii show all final result that have be derive use the method discus in section iv θ co represent the correct angle explain in section iv graph of both these set of data be show in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the error calculate in table iii be easy to calculate and merely involve use the standard error combine rule however the procedure in calculate the initial error begin when align the diffraction grate when the telescope be first align with collimator with the cross wire focus on the central image an angle reading of 221 • 38 be take however there be an error of ±0.5 on this reading due to this be half of the small measurable interval on the scale thus when the telescope be then turn through 90 • the new angle which the telescope be at be 131 • 38 ±0.5 next the diffraction grate be focus exactly at 45 • to both the telescope and the collimator again by make use of the cross wire then an angle reading of 80 • be take use the vernier scale again once more this reading include an error of ±0.5 thus when the diffraction grate be turn back there be yet again the same error for the same reason therefore the diffraction grate be normal to the collimator with an error of ±1 this mean that the error for any singular reading be ±1.5 a it include the add error of the grate calibration but also the ±0.5 error of any reading take at an angle θ co to the central fringe the uncertainty in λ be directly calculate in python by use the function matplotlib and scipy we be able to directly read off the uncertainty for both wavelength σ λr 2.42nm for the red line and σ λb 6.66nm for the blue line for each colour an associate rydberg constant value could be obtained.the error be calculate in the form k λ 2 × σ λ where k be equal to λ be the wavelength of the colour and σ λ be the uncertainty in λ. finally the two value of r ∞ be average and the uncertainty be add in quadrature and halve to obtain the uncertainty in r ∞ give above in this report we present the result of an experiment to determine rydberg 's constant r ∞ by study the spectral line of hydrogen the data be finally compile to determine the value of r ∞ a 1.089 × 10 7 ± 82490m −1 unfortunately the true value of 10,973,731.6 m −1 be just outside the error of margin for this result suggest that the experiment could have be improve one aspect that could have improve the overall accuracy be carry out the same procedure for the aqua and purple spectral line however we be not able to clearly identify line from these colour this may have be due to the fact that the hydrogen lamp be kept on for too long if this experiment be to be carry out again we would make sure that the lamp be turn off every 30 second to allow the lamp to remain cool another possibility it that the error of ±1.5 for the angle reading be indeed too low due to the small size of the vernier scale and the of take reading use a large magnify glass in the dark it be possible that the error on the angle be more on the order of ±5",superficial,the
23,GS_TAP080_Redacted,in this experiment we use a grate spectrometer to obtain data on the visible emission spectrum of hydrogen to deduce the rydberg constant this require the balmer transition

atom consists of a large number of very narrow slit each slit be separate by a distance d. a principal maximum for light of wavelength λ occurs when an integer multiple m of 2π be the phase difference between neighbour ray of light a can be see from figure 1 the path difference equal d sin θ. hence fig 1 this figure be a schematic representation of a spectrometer the collimate lens make the light from the source passing through the narrow slit parallel this light travel perpendicular to the grate which be diffract and focus onto the cross-hair by the camera a camera allows for a magnify image to be view through the eyepiece the inset show the path difference d sin θ. cite from 1 and therefore where m be the order number of the maximum a an example for n 4 slit the fringe pattern show in figure 2 occurs when n slit be illuminate the first minimum occurs at a phase angle the resolve power of the spectrometer be essential a we can identify the minimum difference in wavelength such that two spectral line can be distinguish clearly we can find this by consider the fact that minimum in a certain diffraction fig 2 the diffraction pattern see when n 4 show the principal minimum and maximum cite from 1 pattern occur at the same position a the maximum in a different pattern this can be see in figure 3 where light have a second wavelength λ 2 λ − ∆λ produce it m th principal maximum at a slightly different angle θ 2 where d sin θ 2 mλ 2 a minimum will occur at angle θ if by substitute for d sin θ use equation 5 and 6 the difference in wavelength ∆λ λ−λ 2 where ∆λ λ. consequently where λ ∆λ be the resolve power r. this mean that the small difference in wavelength ∆λ which can be distinguish at a wavelength λ can be found halfway between two equal spectral line the intensity be approximately 20 less than the peak equation 8 represent the separation at which this occurs and thus the two line be distinguishable from each other in this experiment we use a 300 line per mm grate which mean n be large and hence ∆λ be small which mean the spectrometer can resolve spectral line to a very small difference in wavelength the rydberg formula for the transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by where r ∞ be the rydberg constant and n and p be integer represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the hydrogen atom respectively the accurately measure value of the rydberg constant r ∞ be 10973731.6 m −1 r ∞ can be express in term of fundamental constant a where α be the fine structure constant m e the mass of the electron c the speed of light and h planck 's constant α can be express a where h be the reduce planck constant e be the charge of an electron and 0 the permittivity of free space note that α be dimensionless where 1/α ∼ 134.036. the balmer series be the series of spectral line emit by an excite hydrogen atom in the visible spectrum and be give by equation 9 with the value of p 2 and n 3 4 5 .. this be for the atom drop from the n th energy level to the second i.e p 2 energy level figure 4 show this for n 3 4 with p 2. this cause a photon of frequency in the visible spectrum to be give off by use a colour chart and equation 9 it be possible to calculate the expect value of λ and identify the colour of light expect to be observe in the spectrum reference 1 and 2 be use to explain the theory the spectrometer need careful adjustment and set up before it could be use a schematic representation of the spectrometer be show in figure 1. we adjust the eyepiece by observe the emission spectrum of sodium atom use a sodium lamp such that the image be at a convenient view distance we use a sodium lamp for adjustment instead of a hydrogen lamp because leave the hydrogen lamp for too long cause weak transition from molecular hydrogen to be observe but most importantly the hydrogen line grow weaker and dimmer in time and become difficult to observe the camera lens be focus by bring a distant object into focus -in our case we focus on a lamp-post on the street we do this so that there be no parallax between the cross hair and the image the telescope be then align with the axis of the collimator the sodium lamp be place close to the slit and the focus of the collimator be adjust to produce a sharp image of the slit at the cross hair we set the cross hair to an `` x `` rather than a `` `` a this make it easy to focus it centre on the centre of a maximum thereby achieve a more accurate measurement of the angular displacement it be very important to understand what each clamp screw and slow motion drive do a turn the wrong one could disrupt the whole setup the rotate telescope scale read from 0 − 360 • the scale be read relative to a zero fiducial reading on the vernier scale which be fix to the rotate table base the vernier scale read in arcminute or sixtieth of a degree the telescope be then move through precisely 90 • and clamped into position a mirror be put into the grate holder and the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit be see in the eyepiece do this ensures that the incident beam from the collimator be 45 • to the mirror surface this be confirm by now replace the mirror with the 300 line per mm grate many orange sodium spectral line be observe but line the median line with the crosshair ensures that the grate surface be 45 • to the beam the grate surface be fragile and hence great care be take not to touch it the screw under the grate table be use to set the height of the slit image the aperture be decrease to obtain a solid vertical spectral line the grate drive be use to set the grate such that the slit image be precisely at the cross hair note the reading on both the scale a an initial reading the grate be then rotate precisely through 45 • this ensures the grate be accurately set and the beam be normal to it surface the spectral line be observe through the telescope and be note to be above the plane define by the cross hair this occur because the grate ruling be not parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope to correct this a diffract image of the slit at a large angle of diffraction be observe the appropriate grate adjustment screw be use to rotate the grate in the plane of it surface to low the image it be essential to only rotate the grate in the plane of it surface to ensure that the incident beam be still normal to it surface we could now proceed with the experiment to use the spectrometer to make accurate repeatable measurement the sodium lamp be now replace with the hydrogen lamp the main scale reading combine with the vernier scale reading give the total angle the vernier scale reading be obtain by observe which vernier ruling line up with a ruling on the fix scale the angular displacement

which be not see this may mean that the hydrogen atom be not excite enough to produce this line or that it be too dark to be see perhaps a well lamp and a darker room would allow for this spectral line to be observe the value for λ obtain from each gradient yield a minimal uncertainty a be see in table i -the large percentage uncertainty be 0.72 for red light d have negligible uncertainty which implies that the uncertainty in the value of λ be only dependent on the uncertainty in the gradient of the line of best fit from equation 12 the uncertainty in the gradient be dependent on the consistency and accuracy of our measurement for θ. a the spectrometer be a very accurate instrument capable of a precision of under three part in ten thousand 1 the error do not originate from the limitation of the setup but be systematic far n and p be constant and hence the systematic error in r ∞ originates from that in λ. our value for r ∞ a give in equation 14 differ by 0.97 from the true value far an error of 0.31 on the mean be very small and do not include the true value this suggests the presence of a small systematic error there be several potential source of systematic error parallax be the major source of systematic error a we have to use a magnify glass to identify the position where the vernier ruling coincide with the fix scale ruling from various view angle the ruling be very close to each other the process even more difficult we estimate the error in θ due to this difficulty a 2 arcminute and parallax a 1 arcminute to the vernier reading -a total error of 3 arcminute these error be include in the previous calculation but i believe parallax would have add an error of 0.2 • to our central maximum fiducial reading if this be account for the modify python code produce the revise value of r ∞ r ∞ 10 960 000 ± 40 000 m −1 15 a can be see in equation 15 the revise r ∞ and it error include the true value it now differs from the true value by 0.1 the zero error on the scale be non existent however a the experiment be perform on two separate day this meant that we have to use the instrument a be set-up by the group precede u there may have be a change in the spectrometer use thus ever so slightly affect measurement even though we re-configured the entire instrument additionally we have to re-configure the spectrometer a the wrong clamp screw be turn which meant that the scale be not fix and our setup be disrupt when the telescope be move this may have cause the telescope to be slightly mis-aligned with the collimator while measure θ the table that the spectrometer sits on would move slightly which would be re-adjusted this would slightly affect lamp position even though we have marked the fix position of the lamp relative to the table this could potentially add some error far not focus the cross-hair on the exact centre of the spectral line may have also cause a very slight error in θ in the order of less than 1 arcminute -negligible background light from the computer and lamp be use by the other group perform the experiment would sometimes be see through the telescope which make focus the cross-hair difficultperhaps add an error in the order of less than 1 arcminute a well although negligible if all these source of systematic error be account for by re-visiting the experiment and quantify the error a with parallax the value for r ∞ achieve would be even closer to the true value reduce the percentage difference to small than even 0.1 while reduce the error on it v. conclusion in this report we aim to calculate the rydberg constant by use a spectrometer we measure the angular displacement of each order maximum the grate equation be use to calculate the wavelength of the spectral line observe eventually the balmer series for hydrogen be use to obtain a value for the rydberg constant our initial value r ∞ 11080000 ± 30000 m −1 differ by 0.97 from the true value after accounting for the source of systematic error in the experiment with the major source be parallax the revise value r ∞ 10960000 ± 40000 m −1 differ only by 0.1 and include the true value within the error far source of error which would decrease the percentage difference even more be also suggest this indicates that the experiment be a success in obtain an accurate value for r ∞ to improve the experiment far we would complete the entire experiment in one day instead -thus eliminate the effect of a change of set-up furthermore take additional repeat would only reduce the error on the value this experiment highlight the need for error analysis and how to account for systematic error the experience gain in python error propagation will be useful for future experiment,prediction,bal
24,GS_WFX625_Redacted,this paper discus the method use to outline an experiment to determine a value for rydberg 's constant use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer to determine the wavelength of the various spectral line we take data for the two most visible spectral line red and blue and calculate a value for rydberg 's constant from both we obtain a final value of 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 despite the experimental method we use have low systematic and random error due to the high resolution of the grate spectrometer use we believe the final result 's error be mainly due to the fact that only the red and blue spectral line be use this be because they be the only two spectral line we could take accurate and precise data for he rydberg constant be an important constant link the wavelength of several element spectrum with their atomic structure and be originally introduce by johannes robert rydberg 1854-1919 when he publish his find in 1890 on the emission spectrum of certain element 1 originally of empirical nature the rydberg constant be use in an equation that attempt to find some sort of order in the line of emission spectrum of the element when precise measurement of the wavelength of the emission spectrum of the element be carry out it soon become clear that some of the line fell into pattern the line would start out initially space out and start to crowd together these pattern be call 'spectral series and a the different line in the series can be label n n+1 n+2 and so forth the correspond wavelength label a 𝜆n physicist begin to explore and try and find the mathematical relationship between 𝜆n and n. rydberg analytically found a solution the problem with the equation 𝑛 𝑁 0 where n be the wavenumber 1/𝜆 where 𝜆 be the wavelength n0 be rydberg 's constant first calculate to be 109721.6cm -1 and m and p be integer that be specific to the member of the series 1 rydberg found that his equation fit the balmer series the spectral series for the emission spectrum of hydrogen use p 2 and m ≥ 3. this equation provide an accurate representation for many spectral series of different element but be conceive purely through observation and calculation the scientific theory to support it come more than 20 year later when bohr use the idea that the frequency of the photon emit by an atom be directly proportional to the difference in energy state which give m and p meaning the initial and final energy state 2 the rydberg constant could now be express a where r be the rydberg constant with an accepted measure value of 10973731.6m -1 me the mass of the electron c the speed of light h plank 's constant and 𝛼 the fine structure constant which can be far express by the follow equation where e be the charge of an electron 𝜖0 be the permittivity of free space and h be the reduce planck constant in our experiment we observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen with a grate spectrometer in order to find a value for rydberg 's constant a grate spectrometer be necessary so we could take multiple reading and measure the wavelength of different member of the balmer series although due to experimental condition only the first two red and blue be clearly visible enough to take consistent record the diffraction grate be simply a large number n of narrow slit all an equal d away from each other 3 the path difference between neighbour ray from a diffraction grate be 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 and so where m be the order number of the diffraction pattern this show that a d and 𝜆 be constant 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 and the order number should be directly proportional we use this fact by measure the angle at successive order number and graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against the order number to yield a straight line with gradient equal to 𝜆/d in this experiment we use a diffraction grate with 78.8 line per millimeter which mean d be 0.127mm use the grate spectrometer a show in fig 1 require setup and calibration of the three section of the equipment firstly we have to adjust the camera so it would be in focus with collimate light we do this by point determine rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp t the camera at an object on the other side of the laboratory room about 30m away a the object be sufficiently far enough away that the light ray come from it will be collimate themselves now that the camera be calibrate for collimate light we adjust the collimator by rotate the camera back in line with the collimator and use a sodium lamp we use sodium lamp a a substitute for hydrogen lamp a they do not heat up a easily and we would have to turn off the hydrogen lamp every few minute which would disrupt the calibration we adjust the focus ring on the collimator until the slit through which the light be come through be in focus with the diffraction grate now in place we now align the camera with the grate in order to align them we use the vernier scale which could measure the angle at a resolution of 1 arcminute all angle measurement have a very small uncertainty of ±1 arcminute a we have a magnify glass and take careful measurement each time finally we adjust the orientation of the grate by adjust the screw on the platform that held it this be key a it ensures that the distance between adjacent slit be d a if it have be rotate the distance would actually be dcosθ where θ be the angle between the horizontal plane and the bottom of the grate we ensure that the angle be minimize by use the camera and diffraction grate themselves by rotate and slowly sweep the camera through the various order we observe the spectral line gradually get high due to the grate 's orientation we adjust the orientation to minimize this effect and stop when the effect be not noticeable the grate spectrometer be now ready to be use we swap the sodium lamp for a hydrogen lamp and adjust the slit width on the collimator to find a balance between allow enough light through to be able to see the spectral line of high order but not too much that the line would be out of focus we begin measure the angle of the camera whenever the crosshair align with a spectral line for successive order number we decide to adjust the orientation of the crosshair so that the line be at a 45° angle this make it considerably easy to estimate the position of a spectral line we believe this be due to the four line act a a reference to compare the position of the spectral line to whereas if the crosshair be rotate vertically so the orientation have that of a '+ sign the horizontal line do not help u at all in closing down on a spectral line we measure and record once again with a resolution of 1 arcminute the angle for ±3 order include the zeroth order of the diffraction pattern of the blue and red spectral line in order to determine their wavelength although there be other colour present they be too faint to get consistent reliable result with a large enough range the result for the angle of the various order of the red and blue spectral line be show in table 1 the result show a clear trend of a roughly 3° interval between red order and a roughly 2° interval between blue order this be consistent with what we expect a red light have a large wavelength than blue light from equation 4 we can see that sinθ be proportional to the wavelength of the light and with a range roughly twenty to thirty degree we know that θ will be roughly proportional with sinθ θ will increase with sinθ we plot a scatterplot of our result of sinθ against the order and calculate the line of best fit by use the scipy polyfit function weight the point all equally a we saw no anomaly and plot the line use the scipy poly1d function the line of best fit be show in fig 2 the different gradient clearly show the different wavelength for red and blue light note that sinθ do not equal 0 at the zeroth order a we decide to keep the start angle consistent with our result and not make everything relative to a zeroth order of 0° fig 3 show our result relative to 0° at the zeroth order to show the result from the grate spectrometer where 'red angle and 'blue angle be the angle for the red spectral line and blue spectral line respectively we originally record the result start at order 0 and work our way into the positive order first we checked the zeroth order again to have the same reference point for the negative order but do not record a mean average a they be the same for both the red and blue spectral line the result show a clear trend of a roughly 3 interval between red order and a roughly 2 interval between blue order a grate spectrometer fig 1 a diagram to show the grate spectrometer that we use in the experiment divide into three main part the collimator the prism table that house the grate and the telescope or camera that contain the eyepiece for u to observe the spectral line through 4 the most noticeable difference would be that the line of best fit now have a positive gradient and they both cross exactly at the zeroth order which be not the case before there be a 7 arcminute difference between the two a our final result for calculate rydberg 's constant be dependent on the gradient of the straight line the fact that they perfectly cross be not important and it be merely a translation of the two line however change the start point so that the angle be 0° at the zeroth order be important a the different value of sinθ will be different at this range most notably there be value of sinθ which be positive but a the sin curve do not have a constant gradient different start point will yield different gradient for our line of best fit this be key a it will affect our final value when calculate rydberg 's constant and so we decide to stay true to our result use equation 4 a the equation of our line of best fit we use 𝜆/d be the gradient of the two straight line we calculate the wavelength of the two spectral line to be 6.16 × 10 −7 𝑚 ± 0.10 × 10 −7 𝑚 ±1.62 for red light and 4.41 × 10 −7 𝑚 ± 0.09 × 10 −7 𝑚 ±2.04 for blue light we calculate the error in the gradient of the straight line use the covariant matrix generate from the sp.polyfit function we then calculate the rydberg constant use equation 1 and use p a 2 and m a 3 and 4 for red and blue light respectively we calculate the rydberg constant to be 10733268.1292m -1 use the red wavelength and 11106867.2335m -1 use the blue wavelength we found that the mean average for the rydberg constant be 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 despite measure the angle for the diffract spectral line to a high degree of accuracy and precision use the vernier scale with a resolution of 1 arcminute we believe that the fact that we only manage to use two spectral line red and blue meant that ultimately our final result have a high standard deviation and therefore error have we be able to see other spectral line and record data for them we would have be able to greatly reduce our standard deviation in our final result overall throughout the experiment we believe we kept the experimental error low due to our careful experimental technique however we be not able to take multiple repeat due to time constraint which could have help to reduce random error and increase the accuracy of our final result but not by much a we encounter no anomaly and all of the data point be within the straight best fit line we have calculate the error bar use the bad case scenario of ±0.5° on all of our angle a the exact position of the spectral line of high order be harder to discern have only seven data point be not ideal either a this increase the uncertainty and error of the gradient of the straight line although increase the number of data point would prove difficult due to the fact that any order above three become increasingly difficult to make out and this would then increase the overall uncertainty for each value of the angle the aim of this experiment be to determine the value for rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer with a 78.8 line/mm grate and a hydrogen lamp use a hydrogen lamp allow u to calculate rydberg 's constant use the balmer series by measure the angle for the various order of red and blue spectral line we obtain a final experimental value for the rydberg constant of 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 and decide the large source of error be due to the fact that we only use two different spectral line which give a high standard deviation for our final result we believe this error could be reduce by change the light condition such that the other spectral line can be see and attempt to take data for high order of the diffract line graph of result fig 2 a scatterplot and straight line of best fit for both the red and blue spectral line although there be no anomaly the 0 order for the red and blue spectral line do differ slightly but be within each other give the error bar graph of result with 0 at order zero fig 3 the same result yield a slightly different scatterplot and line of best fit note that this time both line cross exactly at the origin a they have be make to do so,superficial,bal

26,GS_CZD812_Redacted,a grate spectrometer have be set up in order to take accurate measurement of angular displacement from the central maximum of spectral emission line from a hydrogen discharge lamp then use the rydberg formula and the diffraction equation an average experimental value for the rydberg constant have be determine which have be found to be 10 921 266.74 ± 197 635.84 m -1 the percentage difference between the experimental value and the theoretical value calculate use some fundamental constant in atomic physic have be compute to be 0.54 the grate spectrometer be an apparatus that make use of a combination of lens and a diffraction grate in order to separate light into it component colour use the wave property of interference and diffraction one application of this instrument be the technique of spectroscopy which be an important technique that physicist use when study a wide range of object include hot solid hot gas and cold gas this technique be use in order to find the element which an object be make of a each element have it own unique emission spectrum amongst those thing that can be study use spectroscopy there be hydrogen gas investigate the emission line spectrum of the light emit by a hydrogen discharge lamp by measure the angular displacement of it spectral line use a grate spectrometer can be use to determine the value of the rydberg constant this be a quantity name after the swedish physicist johannes rydberg who do work on the hydrogen spectrum 1 the rydberg constant be very significant in atomic physic owe to it connection to the fundamental physical constant m c e h and ε 0 these constant be define in section ii.ii a diffraction grate be a flat sheet of glass or metal rule with straight slit with equal distance between them the diffraction grate of the grate spectrometer have slit which be n -1 m apart where n be the number of slit per metre when two ray emerge from the slit interfere then there be a maximum i.e constructive interference when their phase difference be 2πn where n 1 2 3 … where be the wavelength of the light through the diffraction grate the path difference be s n θ hence where n be the order number of the maximum in the interference pattern n 1 be for the two maximum on either side closest to the principal maximum n 2 be for the two second-closest maximum and so on θ be the angular displacement of the order maximum from the principal maximum and d n -1 of the diffraction grate therefore the final formula be by rearrange equation 1 the formula be equation 2 show that if d be know and θ and n be determine experimentally use the grate spectrometer then a graph of s n θ on the y-axis and n on the x-axis can be plot the gradient of this graph multiply by d would give the wavelength of the monochromatic light 2 ii.ii the rydberg equation and emission spectrum the rydberg equation `` be a theoretical prediction of the wavelength found in the emission line spectrum of hydrogen atom `` 1 these wavelength be give by the formula where be the wavelength of the photon emit from the electron transition or absorbed if the electron start out at the low energy level instead of the high onefor an absorption spectrum r be the rydberg constant and n and p be the principal quantum number of the initial and final energy level of the electron respectively for an emission line spectrum the principal quantum number be the number give to each orbit the small orbit have principal quantum number 1 the next orbit have number 2 and so on in ascend order of size see fig 1 3 figure 1 electron orbit with the principal quantum number and the balmer electron transition 4 the rydberg constant r ∞ can be express by the physical fundamental constant where m be the mass of the electron e be the charge of the electron ε 0 be the permittivity of free space h be planck 's constant a c be the speed of light in a vacuum 1 if p 2 and n be set to the integer from 3 to 7 in equation 3 then the subsequent wavelength calculate make up the balmer series of the spectral line for atomic hydrogen see fig 1 which represent all the electron transition down to orbit 2. the calculate wavelength be part of the visible spectrum and one spectral line wavelength be in the ultraviolet region 1 iii the experimental method in order to measure the angular displacement of spectral line from a hydrogen lamp at the first the grate spectrometer need to be set up and calibrate see fig 2 for final grate spectrometer setup for the setup instead of use a hydrogen lamp a sodium lamp be use because a hydrogen lamp get hot fairly quickly so it be n't suitable for setup because set up the spectrometer take about an hour and fifteen minute 2 at first the eyepiece be focus on the crosswire and then the camera lens be focus such that a distant object be focus on the cross wire for the second part the distant object be a tree the grate spectrometer be take to be point out of the window 2 afterwards the telescope be turn to be align with the axis of the collimator the collimator focus be adjust to get a sharp image of the crosswire 2 then the telescope be move through 90° and a diffraction grate d 1/ 3x10 5 m be place in the holder then the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the entrance slit be see this align with the cross hair such that the image through the eyepiece be a cross shape with a vertical orange line through the middle which be the spectral emission line of the sodium vapour this indicate that the grate surface be at 45° to the axis of the collimator then the telescope be turn through 90° again so that it be in line with the axis of the collimator and the diffraction grate be turn so that it surface be normal to the axis 2 figure 2 the final setup of the grate spectrometer the problem encounter here be that the spectral line have a thickness also some difficulty be encounter when adjust the telescope position so the cross hair intersection would be in the middle of it thus this be a source of error however my lab partner and i decide that the thickness of the line be n't thick enough for the error to not be negligible the spectral line have a thickness because energy level be n't infinitely sharp due to hyperfine splittingthe zeeman effect splitting of spectral line due to a b-field there be magnetic object around the apparatus in the room such a metal paperclip and other apparatus with magnetic metal component but their effect be very subtle a hyperfine splitting be n't observe in addition the negligible error be justified also because the temperature in the room be quite standard and do n't affect the hydrogen gas to the extent that we could n't ignore it so thermal doppler broadening do n't affect our subsequent measurement either 2 5 after the setup we interpret the spectral line in the eyepiece to be the central maximum of the diffraction pattern because the telescope be align with the axis of the collimator ideally the central maximum should have zero angular displacement from the axis of the collimator and the slit image in the eyepiece be the closest to the central maximum with almost zero angular displacement from the central maximum 2 iii.ii determine the rydberg constant after set up the spectrometer to take accurate measurement of angular displacement of spectral emission line the sodium lamp be replace with the hydrogen lamp during the course of the experiment although we be told that the lamp should be turn off every 10 minute for about 15-20 minute it be kept on for the entirety of the experiment a it be advise that instead the lamp should be turn off when the spectral line start flicker which do n't happen when align with the principal axis of the collimator the scale on the spectrometer read 80.40 ± 0.05° and this angle be decide to be the reference angle for the n th order maximum 0.05° 3 minute of arc be decide to be the absolute uncertainty for each angle measurement for the follow reason  decide where the measurement mark line up be quite difficult because the scale be small and while try to read it  i be in an awkward position because the other component of the spectrometer get in my way  we decide that get the measurement wrong by more than 3 minute of arc be highly unlikely  the room be dark and a magnify glass with a light be require to be use to read the scale and even then the scale be difficult to read  parallax error be not likely because the scale be very close together and it be test that my position when reading the scale do n't affect it o it be test by me reading the 80.4° reading from different position and a far a i could tell the measurement do n't change when look through the eyepiece the observation be that there be 3 different colour and hence 3 different wavelength of light these be red pinkish light blue almost turquoise and violet almost purple the order from the central maximum be that red be first and then light blue and then violet on both side of the central maximum we be expect to see four line because accord to the balmer series and the rydberg equation see section ii.ii we therefore believe that the 4 th spectral line be too close to the ultraviolet region for u to see or just in that region equation 1 be for monochromatic light and there be 3 different wavelength show so the result for n and θ be collect separately for each colour and 3 different table and graph be plot for each colour in order to take measurement for each wavelength the telescope start out at the central maximum and then be turn until the cross hair intersection align with the middle of the nth order spectral line this be do on both side of the principal maximum and go up to n 3. it could n't go far because the intensity become too low especially for the violet wavelength where we could n't take measurement for n 3 on both side due to that reason in addition the spectrometer be set up next to a wall so the telescope be n't able to go far on one side of the principal maximum only because the wall be block it apart from the uncertainty in the angular displacement of the maximum there be n't any other uncertainty for any other quantity in equation 1. from the 3 graph the gradient multiply by d give 3 different wavelength the long for red and the shortest for violet these result be then use in equation 3 with n 3 for red n 4 for light blue and n 5 for violet for the red and light blue wavelength 6 reading of θ be take in total go up to n 3 for each side for the violet wavelength only 4 reading be take up to n 2. hence the uncertainty in r ∞ calculate from violet light be expect to be large than the other two graph 1 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for red light the graph for red light see graph 1 be compute by python to have the equation 5 the gradient of the graph be multiply by d to give the wavelength of the red light which turn out to be 659.33 ± 7.03 nm see equation 2 graph 2 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for light blue light in the same way for light blue light see graph 2 the equation of the graph be 6 hence by use the same method a for the red light see equation 2 the wavelength of the light blue spectral line be determine to be 491.33 ± 6.20 nm graph 3 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for violet light for violet light python compute the equation of the graph to be 7 the result wavelength be 433.66 ± 13.40 nm the absolute uncertainty for violet light be great than the uncertainty for red and light blue light a expect because it have two less reading in addition the error bar be show to be visibly large for violet light a show by compare graph 1 2 and 3. the error on the wavelength σ be calculate use the follow method where σ be the absolute uncertainty in the gradient compute by python use σ θ 3 minute of arc use these wavelength and equation 3 the rydberg constant determine from each wavelength be the follow  for red light r ∞ 10 920 176.54 ± 116 545.04 m -1 the uncertainty here be 1.07  for light blue light r ∞ 10 854 890.47 ± 136 975.80 m -1 the uncertainty here be 1.26  for violet light r ∞ 10 988 733.21 ± 339 386.68 m -1 the uncertainty here be 3.09 about 3 time the uncertainty for blue and red which be expect a mention before therefore the final value of the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10 921 266.74 ± 197 635.84 m -1 the result uncertainty be calculate to be 1.81 use equation 4 the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10 980 368.06 m -1 and this theoretical result be within the experimental result 's range the difference between the theoretical and the experimental value be determine to be 0.54 to summarise in this experiment i set up a grate spectrometer in order to take accurate measurement of the angular displacement of n th order maximum from the 0 th order maximum i do this for 3 different wavelength which be 3 spectral line correspond to 3 different electron transition to energy level 2 in hydrogen use my data i determine my experimental value of the rydberg constant and compare it to the value of r ∞ i calculate use equation 4 use know value see appendix 2 one improvement on my experimental method would be to repeat the measurement i make a i only record one measurement for each wavelength and for each order then i would 've be able to improve the precision of my result and hence the error bar on graph 1 2 and 3 would 've be small i would 've be able to achieve well overall accuracy in the experiment a possible source of error that

grate spectrometer setup fig 2 it can be see that clamp be use to hold the diffraction grate which could 've bent it and therefore affected the result other factor which i could 've take into account to improve my result be thing such a spectrometer misalignment because even after try to align the spectrometer the slit image in the eyepiece be n't completely vertical air pressure might also affect the hydrogen atom in the hydrogen discharge lamp in addition the rydberg formula itself which be a result of the bohr model of hydrogen be n't completely accurate and have it limitation the bohr model

to observe and measure the angle of maximum for balmer series photon emit from a hydrogen lamp graph be use to find the wavelength of the different light in the balmer series and these wavelength be plot use the rydberg equation to find the rydberg constant t his experiment be conduct to accurately determine the rydberg constant which be one of the most accurately measure physical constant 1 the rydberg constant first appear a an empirical constant in the rydberg formula 1 when johannes rydberg generalise the balmer equation found by johann balmer to transition between any two energy level in hydrogen niels bohr later demonstrate that the rydberg constant could be calculate use more fundamental constant by adopt the bohr model a see in equation 4 5 the rydberg constant be thus strongly related to the fine structure constant which be in turn related to the fundamental probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon 2 and so be of extreme theoretical importance previously the rydberg constant be experimentally determine via the spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen a proton and an electron a in this experiment however in a more recent experiment the lamb shift of muonic hydrogen a proton and negative muon be measure use pulse laser spectroscopy which suggest the accepted value of the rydberg constant should be change by almost 5 standard deviation 3 the current codata accepted value of the rydberg constant be r ∞ 10973731.568508 ± 0.000065 m −1 4 this mean that the rydberg constant be know with an extremely low percentage uncertainty of less than 6 × 10 −10 i n a gas-discharge hydrogen lamp the electric field cause some atom near the anode to positively ionise free electron the free electron then move to the anode the cation proton form by the ionisation be now attract to the cathode and so be accelerate eventually they collide with a neutral atom which transfer electron to the cation when the electron be transfer it fall from high energy level to low one in the hydrogen atom thus emit a photon to conserve energy a it potential energy decrease note these lamp be fundamentally different to incandescent lamp where a whole nearly continuous spectrum of light be emit the wavelength λ of the photon emit in the hydrogen gas-discharge lamp be give by the equation 1 originally posit by johannes rydberg where p be the initial principle quantum number and q be the final principle quantum number thus the rydberg constant may be found if λ p and q be know the rydberg constant can be interpret a the high wavenumber of a photon possible emit from an electron decrease it energy level in hydrogen by take p 1 and q ∞ the light from the lamp may be pas through a lens to collimate the light before be disperse by a diffraction grate if we assume the grate slit width be small compare with the wavelength we can assume the light will diffract uniformly this allows each slit to act a a secondary source the light from each secondary source will then interfere with light from other secondary source in this case an interference pattern will be produce in which the angle θ at which each order maximum appear be give by equation 2 where n be the order of the maximum and d be the slit space 5 use a diffraction grate reduces the intensity of the light between the maximum and so increase the resolve power of the apparatus the point where line of light appear in the pattern be point where the phase shift between light from each secondary source or slit be very close to 0. wavelength observable by the human eye lie in the range 390nm to 700nm the balmer series be the set of spectral line for hydrogen emission when an electron transfer from an energy level p 2 to q 2. the balmer series be show in figure 1. a subset of the balmer series h α h β h γ and h δ lie in the visible range and these be the wavelength that be measure during the experiment the balmer series be particularly useful in astronomy a hydrogen be the most common element in the universe the doppler shift of a star 's balmer series will indicate it radial velocity and the relative intensity of each member of the series will indicate the temperature the balmer series wavelength may be found use equation 1 set p 2 and let q 3 4 5 .... ∞ the balmer series tends to a wavelength of 346.6nm at q ∞ the resolve power ∆λ of the grate spectrometer be give by equation 3 where n be the number of slit ∆λ be a measure of whether two similar wavelength be distinguishable by use the bohr model which place electron orbit in progressively large circle centre on a small massive positive nucleus the rydberg constant may be derive in term of fundamental constant where m e be the electron rest mass e be the elementary charge 0 be the permittivity of free space h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light in a vacuum once the rydberg constant be found it can be use to determine the fine-structure constant α use equation 5 the fine structure constant can be interpret in vary different way the most basic be perhaps the ratio of the potential energy of two electron a distance d apart and the energy of a photon with wavelength 2πd the fine structure constant be use in perturbative quantum electrodynamics calculation f irst the grate spectrometer a show in figure 2 be calibrate use a sodium gas-discharge lamp the eyepiece be focus on the cross-wire and the camera focus on a distant object 20m the slit width be set to a small a possible for accurate calibration the telescope be then align with the collimator axis the grate be then set at 45 • and the telescope rotate 90 • allow the grate height to be properly set when the grate and telescope be then rotate back to their 0 • position the grate ruling be checked to lie along the axis of rotation of the telescope a the interference pattern be still in the plane of the telescope the cross-wire be rotate so that it form an x rather than a '+ shape allow for well precision and accuracy when the telescope be aim at a line the grate with the high number of slit be use a this increase the resolve power and therefore the accuracy and precision of measurement the grate use have 300 line per mm which give d 3.3 × 10 −6 m. once calibrate the sodium lamp be replace by a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp the telescope be rotate slowly and each colour line the colour and the angle change from the 0 • line be record use the vernier scale this be repeat for the `` negative `` order line in order to acquire more data and negate small effect of incorrect calibration this process be repeat 3 time and the mean take for each colour 's order line data be collect for order line between −3 and 3 inclusive the line for h δ be too dim to be observe in the experiment the data be take quickly a the hydrogen lamp quickly heat up too much and the probability of the require transition occur decrease cause the visible line in the interference pattern to dim a dark room be use in order to well see the interference line and therefore increase precision the high order line e.g n 3 be dimmer and therefore it be necessary to increase the width of the collimator slit to allow more light from the lamp to enter the apparatus and therefore increase the intensity of the line t he graph for each colour 's d sin θ against n be show in figure 3. this graph be plot base on equation 2 each data point be the mean of the three repeat take the uncertainty in the y-axis be found use the standard error formula give in the lab manual 8 base on equation 2 where σ y be the y-axis error and σ θ be the error in θ which by consider the vernier scale and the possibility of incorrect calibration be determine to be σ θ 0.05 • this value for uncertainty be chosen base on the resolution for the vernier scale be 1 60 • and consider the error for calibrate the spectrometer however it may be a slight overestimate give how exactly the line fit the point in the σ y calculation the uncertainty in the grate space d be assume to be negligible σ d 0 a diffraction grate be manufacture extremely well the x-axis error be also assume to be negligible σ x 0 a it be easy to check which order line the light appear at the gradient of this graph for each data set give the wavelength of the emit light a show in the table to reduce uncertainty for wavelength more repeat and a large range of order line could be use the high order line take be 3 a the line be become too dim to accurately measure the position of if a brighter hydrogen lamp be use then this problem would be negate use these wavelength value along with p 2 and q 3 4 5 figure 4 be plot where the gradient give the rydberg constant here we have assume that the visible wavelength will be emit by electron fall from the third fourth and fifth energy level to the second the gradient found from this graph be r ∞ 1.080 × 10 7 m −1 three point be generally consider insufficient for statistically analysis however these be the only three wavelength both in the visible spectrum and intense enough to be easily observe the error in wavelength be found use a covalence matrix of each set of data in figure 3 and then the error in inverse found again use the standard error equation 7. it be clear from the graph that the uncertainty in the purple point be relatively large indicate that θ for the dim purple line be occasionally measure and confuse with the brighter purple line this be also evident when the measure purple wavelength be compare with the accepted value for balmer series wavelength the uncertainty for r ∞ be calculate by take the root mean square error between each value predict by the fit line and the measure data point this value be found to be σ r∞ 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 this equates to a percentage uncertainty of 1.67 therefore the final value of the rydberg constant be r ∞ 1.080 ± 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 it would be possible to decrease uncertainty in the wavelength and therefore r ∞ by take more repeat to drive down statistical uncertainty another possibility be to use a vernier scale with even high resolution although the resolution be already very good o verall the experiment be very successful the initial goal of calculate the rydberg constant be achieve with extremely low uncertainty of 1.67 largely due to the use of the vernier scale and diffraction grate the value of the rydberg constant that we found be r ∞ 1.080 ± 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 which be very close to and within our uncertainty of the codata accepted value of r ∞ 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 if the experiment be to be repeat a darker room and brighter hydrogen lamp could be use in order to improve the visibility of the line and thereby increase precision if we be able to detect other wavelength of light far more wavelength could be plot on figure 4 and different other emission series use thereby reduce the uncertainty in the value of r ∞ and give a more accurate value,extended,bal

found be 1.095 × 10 8 ± 3 × 10 5 which have 0.21 difference from the commonly accepted value the rydberg constant be measure through observe the wavelength of beam of light emit from a hydrogen lamp in order to measure these wavelength a gatig spectrometer be use the rydberg constant r ∞ m −1 be use in spectroscopy to determine the wavelength of light emit when electron move between the shell of an atom for example a hydrogen atom it be first determine by johannes rydberg in 1890 through investigation of the emission spectrum of alkali metal 1 it be beneficial to measure the value of this constant precisely a it can be express in term of several other more fundamental constant a where α be the fine structure constant dimensionless m e the electron mass kg c the speed of light m/s and h plank 's constant kg m 2 s −1 and due to this relation strict confines on the value of r ∞ can be use to restrict the value of these other harder-to-measure constant we chose to measure this constant to this end though it be unsure whether our result will have any significance due to the high level of precision already present in other measurement of this constant 4 a grate spectrometer deflects beam of light through diffraction a diffraction grate a piece of transparent material wit several thinly space parallel line drawn upon it act a a series of slit be at the heart of the spectrometer this grate deflects each beam a different angle θ dependent on it 's wavelength equation 3 and cause each beam to split into several which periodically repeat with different value of θ. these

hydrogen atom be give by the formula where n and p be dimensionless integer and represent the energy state of the atom before and after the emission of the photon consider a grate spectrometer a a series of narrow slit with slit seperation d m for light of wavelength λ m a maximum occurs when the phase difference ∆φ ∆φ m2π 2 where m be any integer the phase difference between ray from the grate can be show to be equal to where ∆l be the difference in length of the path each ray take hence and ∆l mλ a ∆l can also be define a where θ be the angle between the normal and the maximum be consider it can be show that in this case m be define a the order of the consider beam thus by measure the gradient of a plot of sin θ against m a value for λ could be found the grate spectrometer be set up so that the position of an undeflected beam of order 0 be measure a θ 0. this setup be perform use a sodium lamp a the spectrometer 's source a the hydrogen lamp could not be left on for extend period of time the hydrogen lamp be then put into place and the measurement make each measurement be make through the initial identification of a beam through scan with the eyepiece detailed adjustment of the position of the eyepiece be then make until the identify beam be center in the eyepiece 's crosshairs the position be then checked by another party before the position be lock then the hydrogen lamp be switch off and the scale of the spectrometer read twice and the result record the colour of the beam a observe through the eyepiece be also record a a rudimentary measure to identify repeat beam of the same wavelength then the lamp be switch back on and the process repeat this process a repeat until all observe beam be account for table 1 2 and 3 show the result obtain from the experiment figure 2 show a plot of these result the error in these result be due to myself and my partner lack of confidence in our 2. ability to precisely read the vernier scale of the spectrometer a well a the size of the division on this scale thus the error be the same for each result use these value we plot a graph of sin θ against m for each colour of beam figure 2 from this plot and equation 7 we be able to determine value for the wavelength of each colour beam and use those value to estimate r ∞ the result of these calculation be show in table 4. the value we chose for p and n be base on consideration of the know emission line of hydrogen and estimation of which line we be observe inform by data within source 2 these estimate be then average to produce our final value for r ∞ the true value of r ∞ be know to be r ∞ 1.097 373 156 850 8 × 10 8 ± 5.9 × 10 −12 3 our value be accurate to this one with a 0.21 difference with a percentage error of 0.27 our large source of error in our measurement be the value calculate from the purple beam which may be due to the fact that they be fainter than the other beam and so harder to accurately measure the position of in this experiment we aim to determine the rydberg constant with a high degree of accuracy the value we found be within 0.2 of the know value which consider the time and material constraint upon this experiment we believe to satisfy our aim this error could have be reduce by the provision of some kind of aid in find the position of spectral line perhaps a more luminous hydrogen lamp or by use a sensitive camera connect to a computer enable a quantitative judgment of the position of each line this would 've enable the fainter purple spectral line to be more precisely locate and perhaps allow the take of measurement of

green light we realize that green light should be the blue light and the orange light should be ignore during the measurement we found that it be very difficult to tell the reading on the vernier

the grate spectrometer can be use to determine a precise and accurate value of the rydberg constant which this report will detail the rydberg constant relates the discrete wavelength of light that can be emit from an excite atom to the correspond energy level the atom have transition between these wavelength be discrete because the energy level to which the atom can transition to be quantise i.e they take specific value this be outline in section ii we use a hydrogen lamp a a source of excite hydrogen atom and shone the light through the spectrometer to produce the hydrogen emission spectrum the angle each spectral line make with the central maximum be measure and thus the wavelength be determine for each colour of light the spectrometer be utilised because it be capable of precise measurement with a potential minimum uncertainty of three part in ten thousand this be because it u a vernier scale which be accurate to 1 arcminute this allows for precise alignment when set up the spectrometer far detailed in section iii and also precise measurement a a result we be able to reduce the uncertainty in our value to 0.22 which be small when white light pas through a diffraction grate an interference pattern be produce where a series of repeat rainbow continuous spectrum be observe 1 the angle that each order maximum make with the zeroth order maximum be dependent on the wavelength of the light hence the series of continuous spectrum i.e the 'breaking up of the light because the light emit by the hydrogen lamp be compose of discrete wavelength the spectrum observe will have line instead of a continuum we use the spectrometer to measure the aforementioned angle and then equation 1 be use to calculate the correspond wavelength 2 where m be the m th order maximum λ be the wavelength in metre d be adjacent slit space in the grate in metre and sin θ be the sine of the angle from the central maximum each order be observe when a hydrogen atom be excite it electron

atom be transition from n ≥ 3 to n 2. red light be observe when n 3 blue when n 4 and violet when n 5. there be several important component in the spectrometer namely the slit and collimator diffraction grate and the telescope a see in figure 1. the latter two be both move fig 1 a schematic diagram of the grate spectrometer show the main component the light source be a hydrogen lamp and the diffraction grate be 300 line mm −1 5 part whose movement can be finely adjust and measure relative to a rotate angular vernier scale it design allows for these part to be fully fix in position or to be move a require in the alignment process the spectrometer utilises a vernier scale precise to 1 arcminute or 1 60 th of a degree the light passing through the collimator must be at normal incidence to the diffraction grate therefore the alignment of the diffraction grate and telescope be vital to take precise measurement the telescope and eyepiece instrument have a crosshair which be use a a reference point to align the telescope with the centre of each spectral line the crosshair therefore have to be in focus when view an image to do this careful adjustment of the eyepiece be make furthermore the telescope must be focus such that a clear image of the spectrum be visible this be achieve by focus the telescope such that a distant object be clearly visible to precisely align the move part firstly the telescope be align such that an image of the central maximum be in line with the crosshair thus ensure the light be enter the telescope at 180 ± 1 20 ° by fix one part of the vernier scale the telescope be rotate through 90 ± 1 60 ° this angle be measure by note the initial reading on the vernier scale and move to a position 90 ± 1 60 °clockwise from this the diffraction grate holder be then rotate to a position such that a reflect image be at normal incidence to the telescope i.e 45 ± 1 20 ° to the light exit the collimator whilst the telescope be fix the grate be rotate back through 45± 1 60 ° so it be at normal incidence to the light exit the collimator this alignment be measure in the same way a the telescope finally the grate be fix in this position and the telescope be unfixed allow it to move to make the reading all error on these value will be justified in section iv after the spectrometer be correctly align the 300 line mm −1 diffraction grate be place into it holder a 300 line mm −1 be use a oppose to one with few line e.g the 80 line mm −1 also available because it produce a large angle of diffraction thus reduce the percentage error on each angle measurement a narrow slit be use to reduce the width of each spectral line and the collimator to straighten the beam meaning the whole beam be at normal incidence to the grate the telescope be then move into a position where the crosshair be align with the centre of the central maximum the width of the central maximum n 0 be measure to account for the uncertainty on this measurement this process be repeat for each observe colour measure the angle the n th order maximum occur for red and blue 3 ≥ n ≥ -3 and for violet 2 ≥ n ≥ -2 along with the width of each spectral line measure in arcminute because visual interpretation have an effect on view the spectral line two measurement be make for each order to reduce this uncertainty the experiment be perform in a darken room such that there be no effect on the measurement from background light which would otherwise reduce the clarity of the spectral pattern when take measurement we identify three main source of contribute error these be glare and parallax when take measurement on the metal vernier scale uncertainty when align the crosshair with the middle of each spectral line and uncertainty a a result of visual interpretation the precision of the vernier scale would usually be ± 1 120 ° because it small increment be 1 60 ° however because of the low-light condition a magnify glass and torch be use to read the scale the glare of this light on the metal make the scale difficult to read the size of the magnify glass meant that it be too big for the spectrometer meaning measurement use the vernier scale be take at a distance and at an angle to the scale to account for this we have use an increase uncertainty of ± 1 60 ° the width of the central maximum be measure to be 1 20 ° hence the large error bar for m 0 in figure 2 and the width of every other spectral line be 1 60 ° a mention in the method section we take two set of reading for every measurement to account for the error associate with visual interpretation these reading be average and the error be fig 2 a python graph show sin θ against m for each observe wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum iii therefore σ/ √ 2 where σ be the standard deviation therefore the aforementioned error regard the parallax width of the spectral line and standard deviation of the mean be add in quadrature for each measurement of θ. thereafter the error on sin θ be calculate and subsequently plot a error bar on figure 2. to reduce the effect background light would have on the clarity of the spectrum the room be fully black out with the exception of desk lamp this therefore reduce the uncertainty associate with visual interpretation by make the observe spectrum clearer however high order spectral line be still less distinct i.e when m ≥ ±2 this be down to an issue with our setup where despite our best effort not all of the light from the lamp be passing into the collimator this cause light to enter the telescope when it be at large angle from the normal of the grate subsequently reduce the clarity of the spectrum at these high order furthermore use the accepted value of the rydberg constant and set n 6 the resultant wavelength be within the visible range with a wavelength ∼ 410 nm however this be not observe in our spectrum this be most likely due to the issue i have just outline in conjunction with the inconvenience that some group have desk lamp turn on whilst we be take measurement the red and blue spectral line be the clearest and the violet line be only see when m ≤ ±2 this suggests that this error affected small wavelength hence the overall absence of the light correspond to n 6 and m ±3 for n 5. our value for the rydberg constant be 1.1025×10 7 ± 2.5×10 4 m −1 figure 3 show value of the wavelength calculate use data obtain from figure 2 and equation 1. the correspond value of the rydberg constant be calculate from equation 3 use these wavelength the uncertainty on the wavelength be the error on the gradient in figure 2 divide by d. the uncertainty on the rydberg constant be calculate from equation 3 use the aforementioned error the overall uncertainty on our value of r ∞ be the three error add in quadrature the percentage error for our value be 0.22 which be small thus demonstrate the overall precision of our experiment the accepted value of r ∞ be 10,973,731.6 m −1 this be just below the low bound for our value which be 11,000,000 m −1 although it be close to this low bound be ∼ 26,000 m −1 below it this therefore mean that our experiment do not produce an accurate value this be likely due to a systematic error the value of the wavelength correspond to n 3 4 5 calculate use the accepted value of r ∞ and equation 3 our value be all small this therefore explains why our value for r ∞ be big than the accepted value because equation 3 u λ −1 i believe the systematic error have most likely be cause by damage to the diffraction grate cause it to have a small slit space this would produce small value of λ from equation 1. the percentage difference between the value be 0.57 0.52 0.44 respectively the error on these percentage be negligible these value be similar which show that it be a systematic error rather than a random one the purpose of this experiment be to determine an accurate and precise value for the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer our value be 1.1025×10 7 ± 2.5×10 4 m −1 this mean we be successful in determine a precise value because the percentage error for our value be low at 0.22 however we be unsuccessful in determine an accurate one a more precise value could 've be obtain by use a spectrometer with a high degree of precision along with a clearer scale e.g a digital one to reduce glare furthermore by take more measurement in addition have the hydrogen lamp be design in a well way such to reduce it aperture and the experiment have be conduct in isolation the effect of background light would have be nil lastly the diffraction grate use should 've be checked for damage or a brand new one should 've be use to avoid any chance of damage nullify the systematic error this have on our

31,GS_YUK005_Redacted,in this experiment we use spectrometry technique to find the value of the rydberg constant we first set up our spectrometer and we measure the spectrum of hydrogen by passing the light of a hydrogen lamb through a diffraction grate we then measure the scatter angle of some visible light then we could deduce the wavelength of these light with the formula for interference with diffraction grate and use the equation for transition wavelength in hydrogen to obtain 𝑹 ∞ 𝟏𝟎𝟖𝟏𝟒𝟎𝟎𝟎 ± 𝟓𝟏𝟎𝟎𝟎𝒎 −𝟏 his report discus an experiment to obtain a value for the rydberg constant the rydberg constant relates energy level change of an electron in a hydrogen atom to the wavelength of the light emit a there be certain energy level in the hydrogen atom the hydrogen atom can only emit electromagnetic radiation of certain wavelength thus the rydberg constant can relate energy emit and energy level change in a hydrogen atom in this experiment we be only investigate electromagnetic radiation that be within the visible spectrum for a hydrogen atom the visible light emit will be in the balmer series which will simplify the whole experiment a show in the theory part in this experiment we determine wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emit from the hydrogen lamb by passing them through a diffraction grate thus idea about interference through a grate need to be consider at bright fringe of a wavelength of electromagnetic radiation the phase difference be always an integer multiple of 2𝜋 while at a dark fringe the phase difference be always odd integer multiple of 𝜋. assume the view distance of the observer be large enough the ray will be parallel and we can deduce that the path difference between 2 ray ∆𝑙 ∆𝑙 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 from diagram 1 below where d be the slit separation and 𝜃 be the angle of the 2 ray from the horizontal phase difference ∆𝜑 be related to path difference ∆𝑙 a suggest by the equation below where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation with the above equation we could deduce that the angle at which bright fringe appear be give by 𝑛𝜆 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 eq 2 where d be the slit separation we could use this equation to deduce the wavelength of visible light from the hydrogen lamb a hydrogen atom can only emit electromagnetic radiation of certain wavelength due to the fix energy level for electron in the atom wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation be determine by the transition of the electron between these energy level the transition wavelength be give by the formula below where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 𝜆 be the transition wavelength n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level in this experiment we be only observe the light within the visible spectrum and this reduces the difficulty to distinguish what electron jump correspond to which light a visible light be in the balmer series and this series correspond to wavelength cause by electron jump find the rydberg constant with spectroscopy t 2 from nth energy level to the second energy level p=2 we start off by set up the spectrometer a the diagram 2. we focus the camera lens onto a distant object without use grate and view it at the eyepiece to check there be no parallax between the image and the cross wire a parallax will cause huge error in our measurement we then use a sodium lamp instead of hydrogen a our light source because the hydrogen lamp may die if it open for a long period we then find the angle at where the central maximum be find this angle simplify the experiment a we can use the angle difference between the nth maximum and the central maximum to determine the wavelength use equation 2 we use the spectrometer set up a diagram 2 to measure angle where bright fringe appear for visible light 1 and 2. for both color we take the angle at center of the bright fringe a the measurement and this cause uncertainty a it be impossible to determine the exact location of the center for each fringe we use the 78.8 line per mm grate in this experiment a it produce pattern with reasonable separation between fringe and high number of fringe across the 180 degree view angle we measure from -3th order to 2th order for each color a more data will reduce the random error of the result to reduce the error far me and my lab partner measure these angle independently with the location of bright fringe of color 1 and 2 we can plot sin∆𝜃 against n where ∆𝜃 be the angle difference between the angle measure and the angle where central maximum be and n be the order a sin∆𝜃 and n follow a linear relationship the slope of the graph will be 𝜆 𝑑 we could obtain the value of 𝜆 by measure the slope of the graph we can use the value of 𝜆 in equation 3 a we already know p=2 for visible light and we assign value of n to color 1 and 2 by the method of trial and error we know we will find the correct value for n when the two value of 𝑅 ∞ calculate from the n value of color 1 and 2 be similar and close to the accepted value 10973731.6. with the correct value of n we could obtain the value of the rydberg constant by rearrange ∆𝜃 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒 n order ∆𝜃 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒 -3 6.17 -2 4.17 -1 2.17 0 0.17 1 -1.83 2 -3.83 the reference angle at the 0 th order bright fringe be 172°10′ ± 0.2° we could obtain the value of ∆𝜗 by the follow equation where 𝜃 be the measurement from the spectrometer and 𝜃 𝑅𝐸𝐹 be the reference angle at the 0 th order bright fringe we estimate the random error of the measurement by take measurement independently between lab partner and we find that there be around 0.2° difference for every measurement we make we think this error arise from the fact that it be impossible to locate the center of the bright fringe accurately a some of the fringe have low intensity and they be blur this uncertainty propagates to ∆𝜃 all ∆𝜃 measurement will have a 0.4° uncertainty with the table above we plot sin∆𝜃 against n a show below in this graph the slope will be − 𝜆 𝑑 a i assign positive 𝑠𝑖𝑛∆𝜃 value for negative n. we can rearrange and obtain value for 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 use some computational line fitting technique we can obtain the follow value for 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 where 𝜆 1 =663±1 nm and 𝜆 2 442 ± 1 nm we can then deduce the value for the rydberg constant use equation 3 a we have make observation on two visible light we can reduce the random error for the result of rydberg constant by take the average of value derive from the two wavelength 𝑅 ∞ 10810000±50000 𝑚 −1 a we know 𝑅 ∞ only depend on wavelength when n be fix from equation 3 we could work out that the follow relationship with this equation we could obtain ℴ 𝑅 ∞ =50000 the aim of this experiment be to find the rydberg constant in this experiment we use a spectrometer with a grate to determine the wavelength of light emit from a hydrogen lamb and we work out the rydberg constant use equation 3 i think we have obtain some reasonably good measurement in this experiment which lead to a very close result to the accepted value however we spend too much time refining our data and we lack the time to estimate systematic error of the experiment such a misalignment of the spectrometer and lamp position etc i think we could improve this experiment by make more estimation about systematic error after this experiment i become more experienced at use the spectrometer and gain more insight about how spectroscopy can be use in different field of physic,deep,bal
32,GS_BQD756_Redacted,can be consider accurate furthermore a the percentage uncertainty be very low 0.432 we can also say that there be a relatively high precision by this method the rydberg constant r∞ be hugely important in atomic physic and help to relate transition wavelength λt to the energy level which the electron have transition from with the equation where n and p be integer which represent the initial and final state of the atom when the rydberg constant be first establish it be do so empirically in order to make sense of the rydberg equation when apply to a hydrogen spectrum however it have since be show that it can be calculate from more fundamental constant far validate the value this feature be also why the rydberg be so useful it be one of the most precisely know constant so it be very useful when utilized in equation 1 for instance use the rydberg equation transition wavelength can be determine with a very low uncertainty to get such a precise value i have use a grate spectrometer a spectrometer essentially creates a collimate beam of light which be then disperse use a 78.8 mm -1 diffraction grate the spectrum can then be observe use an eyepiece and angle can be record through a vernier scale a long a the spectrometer be correctly calibrate i would hope to achieve very precise result to do this i will have to take measure to reduce the uncertainty of human judgement in part of the method this will be achieve by repeat reading from two or more people or by incorporate digital equipment into the method e.g camera to read vernier scale ii theory spectroscopy be the study and analysis of a spectrum of light the grate spectrometer i have use u the phenomenon of diffraction to separate the collimate light beam into it spectrum this occurs a the individual wavelength of light which sum together to form the beam diffract by different amount the angle of diffraction θ can be link to the wavelength λ by the equation where n be the order of the maximum and d be the space between each slit in the diffraction grate we use a slit space of 1.269x10 -5 m a this produce good spectral pattern for analysis maximum appear during diffraction due to the superposition of wave front at a maximum the path difference between the two wave must be an integer number of wavelength determine the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk a previously mention and show by equation 1 the rydberg constant demonstrates the wavelength of the photon which be emitted/absorbed when there be a change in energy within the atom this due to the discrete energy level which exist within an atom and be explain use the bohr model of the atom figure 1 show some of the more common transition within the hydrogen atom the balmer series in hydrogen be the transition which result in visible photon wavelength contrastingly the lyman series exist in the ultraviolet range and the paschen series in the infrared range bohr also help to show the rydberg constant can not just be found empirically but can also be express use fundamental constant by where α be the fine structure constant me be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be planck 's constant 4 by substitute in the equation for the fine structure constant we have an even more fundamental equation with where e be the charge of an electron and εo be the permittivity of free space iii method to carry out precise measurement it be imperative that the grate spectrometer be correctly calibrate the spectrometer must be in focus and free of parallax so we focus the eyepiece onto the cross hair which be in the middle of the telescope and we could then focus the camera lens onto an image at approximately ten metre away so that the parallel light ray would be in focus when they pa through the camera lens at this point it be important that the lamp be ready to be use and must be place a closely to the slit a possible whilst be completely on view to the slit this be so that the only light come through the eyepiece be from the lamp with the maximum intensity available we ensure the camera collimator and eyepiece be parallel and we change the focus of the collimator so that the slit gap be in focus in the eyepiece from this point it be important that we do not change the focus on any part of the spectrometer a we would then have to repeat the entire process we then place the diffraction grate in to it holder make sure we do not touch the surface and that it be completely vertical we use 78.8mm -1 diffraction grate with this value be determine by the manufacturer from this point we rotate the telescope 90° secure in into position with a screw and proceed to rotate the grate until the entrance of the slit be reflect into the eyepiece approximately 45° we do not need to adjust the height of the image a it be in a good position however we could have do this by use the plate screw if require we record the angle on the vernier scale and continued to rotate the grate through exactly 45° so that the plate be at a 0° incidence we be now happy that the spectrometer be calibrate however we move the telescope around to observe some of the spectral line to confirm that they be be show and be vertical when calibrate correctly and with enough repeat the spectrometer will produce uncertainty of approximately ±0.2nm in order to reduce the effect of human judgement increase this uncertainty we place the camera from a smart phone in a set position to take picture of the vernier scale when an angle need to be measure this reduces uncertainty a it stop the error in reading from an arcminute scale the uncertainty from reading off the scale be reduce from ±1/12° to approximately ±1/120° a sodium lamp be use to collect some preliminary data during the prelimina1y investigation the optimal size of the slit space be dete1mined which would remain constant throughout the experiment and we also decide that the 78.smm-1 be the grate which produce the clearest pattern so that would also remain constant throughout the experiment we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp and begin to record data a see from the balmer series there be 4 main transition which result in visible photon and we will observe 3 transition and take angle measurement for each we be observe red blue and purple band for each colour band we observe the zero order and record the next two maximum on the positive and negative side we would record the order with it correspond angle from the vernier scale when take these reading there be an uncertainty in the width of the band that you be observe to minimize this unce1iainty we each take a reading from both edge of the band and take an average to get a well estimate of where the centre of the band be to finiher decrease the unce1iainty we then take take an average of our own individual measurement use equation 2 we could plot a graph of sin0 a a function of the order of the maximum in this case 0 be the angle from the zero-order maximum this give u a precise estimate of the wavelength of each transition we then use equation 1 to plot the transition wavelength against the transition energy level to detennine the rydberg constant when take measurement for 0 it be very imp01iant that there be no background source of light so the experiment be canied out in a blacked-out room with small desk lamp background light could interfere with the spectrum and reduce the intensity of the spectrum in the eyepiece this would increase the unce1iainty in our measurement other factor which must also remain constant be the humidity and air pressure in the environment ignore negligible fluctuation these be involunta1ily kept constant moreover during the experiment we encounter an issue with the hydrogen lamp they can only be use for time span of around fifteen minute before they overheat and stop work we have one hydrogen lamp break when we be near the end of the experiment despite be the same model from the same manufacturer we still expect to have different result from the new lamp this could be take a a major source of error to dete1mine the rydberg constant we first have to have accurate estimate of the transition wavelength of the emission band we be observe from figure 3 you can see that each band follow a linear relationship which pas through the origin the gradient at each point be equivalent to the transmission wavelength divide by the slit space use this data we compute the wavelength of each band the wavelength of the red band be 622.6 ± 0.7 nm the blue band be 493.3 ± 0.6 nm and the purple band have a wavelength of 444.0 ± 0.9 mn when compru ed to the balmer series these wavelength agree with the actual transition wavelength so they can be consider accurnte the main enors that arose in the wavelength be the enors from measure the diffraction angle of each band which manifest itself in the value of sin0 the calibration of the spectrnmeter be a cause of systematic error even tl1ough the spectrometer be calibrate carefully it be largely do by eye so we can expect a small yet non-negligible constant enor throughout the result i estimate this to be approximately ±0.3nm another major source of systematic euor be the change of the hydrogen lamp midway through our experiment a previously mention the model be the same however they can not be expect to perf01m in the same way i take this to be a systematic enor which be only prevalent in the data record after the change from when the lamp change the relationship still seem to follow a consistent b'end with no real sign of fluctuation fmthe1more a the lamp be the same model and be manufacture at a similar time i have take tl1e e1rnr to be negligible random enors have also be consider despite reading from a camera there be still random enor in reading from the vernier scale i approximate this to be ±0.18nm by observe the small change of angle which could be dete1mined and use equation 2 to check the change in wavelength additionally background source of light do become a sligl1t issue and we do find slight drop in intensity at point which create more unce1iainty when take reading when this occuned we ensmed that the background light be remove and we remeasured the value to get an eitor from a measurement of wavelength we add the eitors in quadrature to get a set eitor of ±0.35nm for every measurement this then have to be add in quadrature to the enor which occmted due to the width of the band of light this be the individual main somce of eitor and it account on average to 50 of each eitor on the wavelength on figme 3 there be no euor bar show a they be so small that they affected the clarity of the data point therefore i remove them we then analyse the wavelength of the emission band use equation 1 the gradient of the graph show in figme 3 be equal to the rydberg constant use the gradient and tl1e eitors which have be estimate practically the value of the rydberg constant be 1094599 ± 15872 m• 1 this show a percentage uncertainty of 0.145 and a percentage euor from the actual rydberg constant 10973739.6m-1 of 0.253 this mean that the actual value of the rydberg constant do not lie in the range of nnceitainty these enors be somced from the e1rnrs in the reciprocal of the wavelength a there be no eitors in the x direction on figme 3. the e1tors here be equivalent to the percentage enors from dete1mining the wavelength for confumation i analyse the graph in figure 3 statistically use a co-variance matrix function which can be found in the scipy module in python this result in a rydberg constant of 1094599 ± 47287 m• 1 from tlus there be now a 0.432 uncertainty so the actual value do now lie in the range of unce1iainty this show that the statistical variation be indeed great than the practical unceitainties that i estimate so i chose to use the statistical unce1tainty in my final value due to this we can say that the experiment be more accurate than initially thought a the expect value be in the coitect range from my experimental value contrnstingly the experiment be not a precise a initially calculate because the percentage uncertainty do in fact increase when statistical method be use this be cause by the random enor in estimate the centre of the enussion band because it be accountable for over 50 of the total enor when the wavelength be compute it be the large source of eitor so it have the most affect when add in quadratm•e v. conclusion the goal of the experiment be to determine a precise and accurate measurement of the rydberg constant we be observe the spectrum from a hydrogen lamp to identify and analyse the balmer series to compute the rydberg constant from it a grate spectrometer be use to diffract the collimate light beam and the angle of diffraction of the maximum be analyse my final value of the rydberg constant be 1094599 ± 47287 m -1 which result in a 0.253 error from the true value with our equipment and skill level i believe we make an accurate and very precise measurement of the rydberg constant this be due to the percentage uncertainty and our error be very small consider human judgement be require in the experiment you can usually rely on human error be in the 2-3 area 5 at least whereas our error be 10 time small than this expect value due to this our value can be consider accurate in order to improve this experiment i would consider a more modern approach to the grate spectrometer a spectrometer which can be programmed to optimise itself in term of grate type and slit size and can identify where maximum exactly lie this would virtually remove all random error from the method make the experimental value much more precise,expert,bal
33,GS_SRW902_Redacted,the wavelength of visible light emit from the balmer series of hydrogen can be use to determine the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and a transmission diffraction grate of

a much a possible a measurement of r ∞ to within less than 0.5 be comfortably achievable with this spectrometer in 1913 niels bohr postulate that an electron can move in stable approximately circular orbit without emit radiation or lose energy 4 the energy of a photon e photon a radiation light be emit be give by where e i and e f denote the initial and final energy of the photon a it emits radiation and fall to a low energy level the final energy level that the photon fall to determines what spectral series be observe during this experiment the wavelength of light due to electron transition in hydrogen atom be measure from a high energy level to the second level n 2 if each energy level be label n 1 n 2 n 3 and so on then the electron transition for a hydrogen atom be call the lyman series 5 n 1 the balmer series 6 n 2 the paschen series 6 n 3 and the brackett series 7 n 4 these transition be show in fig 1 transition to high energy level have also be observe though the spectral line become fainter a the likelihood of a transition to an energy level great than n 6 be quite uncommon electron transition in the balmer series that fall to n 2 emit radiation in the visible spectrum use a hydrogen lamp and the spectrometer the wavelength of light emit from the lamp be determine a equation 2 state the energy of a photon emit from an electron during it transition between two energy level be the difference in energy between those two level if we compare the relative mass of a proton 8 m proton 1.67 × 10 −27 kg to that of an electron 9 m e 9.11×10 −31 kg then it a reasonable assumption that m proton m e the mass of a proton be ≈ 1840 time that of an electron use this assumption and bohr 's postulate we can equate the electrical force f e and the centripetal force f c act on an electron where 0 be the permittivity of free space r n be the orbital radius around the n th shell and v n be the speed of the electron 's orbit all in si unit all other symbol carry the same meaning a define in equation 1 these two force can be equate since the electron and proton have opposite charge with the electron orbit the proton and the assumption that no other force act the radius of the electron 's orbit and it speed be give by and respectively bohr far postulate that 'the angular momentum of the electron round the nucleus in a stationary state of the system be equal to an entire multiple of a universal value independent of the charge on the nucleus 4 in fig 2 the electron can be see in yellow emit radiation a it transition from n 3 to n 2 this be a balmer series spectral line and occurs in the visible spectrum bohr go on to show that the angular momentum of an electron be a quantise integer multiple of h 2π 4 we can therefore write where n ∈ z now rewrite the expression for r n and v n a and equate to equation 4 and 5 respectively we find that and for a hydrogen atom in it ground state the most likely position of the electron occurs at n 1. this be know a the bohr radius r bohr 10 apply the principle of conservation of energy allows the sum of the kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p to be write a a constant e t conservation of

planck-einstein relation 11 that the energy of an emit photon of light be related to it frequency by where h be the planck constant equation 15 can be rearrange 12 to where r ∞ m e e 4 8 0 2 ch 3 m −1 19 to determine a value for the rydberg constant the wavelength of light along with it uncertainty be measure during the experiment electron transition of the balmer series be observe in particular transition from n 3 to n 2 and from n 4 to n 2 use equation 18 and the value of r ∞ quote in the laboratory manual 13 r ∞ 10 973 731.6m −1 wavelength of λ red 656nm and λ blue 486nm should correspond to these two transition respectively these wavelength value be calculate use the currently accepted value of r ∞ so that the two colour of light red and blue be know before start the experimental work when a wave of wavelength λ pas through a small slit the wave be diffract and spread out in a circular path if there be multiple slit of separation distance d such a on a diffraction grate then lot of circular wavefront be form a the wave diffracts through numerous slit these wavefront interfere result in constructive and destructive interference for constructive interference two wave must superpose at a maximum so they be in-phase the path difference between two adjacent slit be λ and so a righttriangle can be construct a in fig 3 such that due to the sinusoidal nature of wave successive minimum and maximum will occur a the wavefront progress maximum be observe for any integer number of λ though the intensity of successive maximum will decrease a the diffraction increase we find therefore that where m ∈ z and be call the order number a student pasco model sp-9268 spectrometer 2 be use to calculate the wavelength of red and blue light emit from a hydrogen lamp a excite electron transition from n 4 and n 3 to the second energy level n 2 equation 21 be use to measure the angle θ at which maximum be observe for order number m ±1 ±2 and ±3 far order number be not

calculate by where d the number of slit per unit length be know value of r ∞ with their associate error be then calculate from equation 18 ensure that the telescope be clearly focus so that well define line of interference could be observe the hydrogen lamp be place near the collimator slit the width of the slit be adjust until the red and blue line be clearly visible and focus the direction of travel of the light be show by black arrow in fig 4 a transmission diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre be use to cause diffraction of the light and for the wavelength to be measure 21 allows for the wavelength to then be calculate adapt from 11 a label set-up of the apparatus use in the experiment be show in fig 5 the telescope be firstly focus on a distant object at the other side of the laboratory minor adjustment to the lens be make to ensure that it be exactly in focus use the focus knob on the top of the telescope for the initial set-up of the apparatus a sodium lamp be use to align the lens this be to eliminate the risk of the hydrogen lamp overheat the sodium lamp be place very close to the collimator slit and the power supply be switch on the telescope be point at the slit and a sharp focus image of the light be observe the angle of rotation of the telescope be note from the vernier scale at this point it be then rotate through 90 • a mirror be place in the grate holder and the grate table be rotate through 45 • so that the slit be reflect and visible from the telescope 's eyepiece the telescope be then return to it original position and a diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre be insert into the grate holder at this point well define blue and red slit could be see through the eyepiece to improve the accuracy of measurement fig 5 a label image of the experimental set up most part of the spectrometer be visible on the image though a few can not be see the slit adjustment be locate to the left of the collimator focus knob and be use to narrow or widen the slit of light from the lamp at the end of the telescope not visible be the eyepiece with cross-hair alignment the cross-hairs can be rotate and be position in such a way to produce an x shape a oppose to a '+ on the underside of the telescope be an adjustment knob use to make small alteration to the focus of the telescope when reading numerical value from the vernier scale a hand held magnify glass be use to reduce the likelihood of misread the scale occasionally use the magnify glass be not very effective if for example the table rotation handle align exactly over the vernier scale in such situation a mobile phone camera be use to capture the scale at an appropriate zoom to reduce the possibility of random error one person take all the reading from the vernier scale whilst the other control the alignment of the telescope a parallax error also have to be consider when take reading from the vernier scale this error be minimise by position the magnify glass/mobile phone directly above the scale and take reading from this position the resolution of the vernier scale on this grate spectrometer be 1arcminute and so an error of ±1arcminute when reading the scale be reasonable it would not be justified to claim an error of ±0.5arcminutes due to the parallax error which can not entirely be ignore when rotate the telescope to the position of each spectral emission line the physical thickness of these line have to be consider since each diffract beam have a physical width over which the wavelength of light remains the same the beam be measure in two place the angle of rotation of the telescope for each spectral line be measure on the left side and the right side of the beam denote by θ lef t and θ right respectively the cross in fig 6 show where the telescope be align to take these reading the error associate with the width of each beam be add in quadrature to the error from reading the vernier scale the error for the width of the fig 6 a graphic of a diffract beam of blue light be observe through the telescope the telescope 's angle of rotation be record at the two x 's and the mean of the two value take reading of θ lef t and θ right have an uncertainty of ±1arcminute though the width of the beam be significantly large than this beam be give by and varied for each beam the variation be likely due to the increase faintness of high order beam and the uncontrollable background light due to other group in the laboratory in general the width of the beam appear to increase a the order number increase in magnitude this be likely due to the great diffraction and decrease in intensity of the light where more background light be present the beam become more difficult to accurately observe this be reflect in the individual error associate with each of the beam also notable be the large width error for the measurement of blue light compare to red for almost all the measurement the blue beam appear fainter and with more fade edge make the exact position of θ lef t and θ right harder to decipher fig 7 show the variation in beam width for red and blue light for order number −2 ≤ m ≤ 2. these value be all much great than the ±1arcminute error due to reading the vernier scale and so dominate when add in quadrature there be little correlation in the data though the error for blue light be consistently high than that for red light except for one reading when plot sin θ against m to determine the wavelength of the red and blue light the mean value be use this method be use to determine the position of each beam since align the cross-hairs with the centre of the slit be much more subjective and introduces a great random error place the cross-hair exactly on the boundary of the slit result in less random error and tell u the width of the beam when the angle at both side be measure fig 7 a graph of the width of the diffract red and blue beam use a diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre colour accordingly over five order number from equation 21 a plot of sin θ against order number m will yield a straight line of gradient λ d two diffraction grate be available during this experiment one with 80 line per millimetre the other with 300 line per millimetre preliminary experimental data show that use the grate with 300 line per millimetre be much more beneficial for this experiment the sharpness and clarity of the diffract beam increase a the number of slit per unit length increase this meant that it be easy to align the telescope with the left and right side of each beam since the side be more define the space between each beam be on average ≈ 9 • when use the 300line grate compare to ≈ 22 • apart for the 80-line grate a consequence of this space be the number of diffract beam that could be observe beam of order m 2 be not at all visible when the 80-line grate be use however when use the 300-line grate third order beam be visible for red light a θ widtherror of around 25arcminutes be measure for the beam when use the 80-line grate during the experiment only the 300-line grate be use to produce the diffract beam this kept the θ widtherror to a minimum and allow for the maximum number of diffract beam to be observe and their position measure 21 and contains error bar for the angle measure at each diffract beam there be no error along the horizontal axis since the order number be unambiguous and could clearly be count from start at the zeroth order beam the zeroth order beam be identify a be a different colour to all the other beam it position be such that the red and blue light appear in the same place and so a purple colour beam be see error along the vertical axis be dependent upon the vary error θ widtherror define by equation 23 a well a the constant error of ±1arcminute due to take reading from the vernier scale the red line of the graph represent the plot of red light and the blue line represent blue light a red diffract beam of order m −3 could be observe through the telescope though blue light of this order could not be the intensity of the red diffract beam appear great than that of the blue light and perhaps explains why red light of this order could be see but blue not though this be purely speculative fig 8 a graph of sin θ against order number m for red and blue light use a diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre the red line represent the data collect from measurement of red light and the blue line represent the blue light data the dimensionless gradient of the red line be 0.195 ± 0.002 and the gradient of the blue line be 0.16 ± 0.02. from the gradient of the two line show in fig 8 the wavelength of red and blue light be calculate use equation 22 where d 1 3×10 5 m they be found to be λ red 650 ± 7nm and λ blue 530 ± 70nm the large error in λ blue be predominantly due to the uncertainty in the width of the diffract beam and be previously discus in detail use equation 18 two value of the rydberg constant can be calculate use the value and uncertainty of λ red and λ blue these be r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 use the measure wavelength of red light and r ∞ 1.0 ± 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 use the wavelength of blue light these value vary from the accepted value of r ∞ by 1.1 and 9.7 respectively a show in fig 8 the relative error due to the width of each beam be much large than the ±1arcminute error due to reading the vernier scale this be the main cause of uncertainty during the experiment spectrometer misalignment could have introduce a systematic error into the experiment though the risk of this be greatly reduce by practise the alignment multiple time before take measurement the spectrometer be set-up in a well-lit room on a sturdy grate table show in fig 5 the likelihood of misalignment be low so it be a reasonable assumption to treat this error a negligible in comparison to other source a significant source of error that be reflect in the error bar of fig 8 be the position of the hydrogen lamp the lamp be position a close to the collimator slit a possible to ensure that the great intensity of light could be observe through the telescope during preliminary test the lamp be place at a distance 20 ± 1 cm away from the collimator slit and the diffract beam observe the beam be noticeably fainter and their boundary not a well define this result in a much large θ widtherror and so the lamp be place a close to the collimator slit a possible during the experiment for measurement of the blue diffract beam the θ widtherror be generally large than the measurement for red light this may be due to the position of the lamp since it be move between reading of the red and blue diffract beam it be possible that the hydrogen lamp be place slightly off centre and so the boundary of the beam for the blue light be less well define this possible mispositioning could also explain why no third order blue beam could be see since the intensity of light able to pa through the collimator slit be less this systematic error affect the uncertainty in the telescope 's angle θ when measure each of the beam and so be account for in the vertical error bar of fig 8 consider the average difference in the error θ widtherror for the red and blue light the mispositioning of the lamp likely increase the error in the blue light data by ≈ 6arcminutes due to the mispositioning the distance of the hydrogen lamp from the collimator slit be great for the measurement of the blue light compare to red when the hydrogen lamp be place away from the collimator slit not only light from the lamp enters through the slit background light played a part in the uncertainty of the boundary of each of the beam and so this source of error be amplify by the mispositioning of the lamp when measure the blue wavelength during the experiment the laboratory light be switch off though desk light be turn on this result in some light pollution to minimise the effect of this background light the spectrometer and lamp be cover by a coat when reading be be take although this eliminate most of the background light not all of it be block since the result of the background light be an increase uncertainty in the exact boundary of the diffract beam this error be again reflect in the vertical error bar of fig 8 and account for an error of ≈ 4arcminutes for all the reading though inevitably varies for each reading defocus of the telescope could have introduce a small systematic error in the measurement a previously mention the spectrometer be set-up multiple time before data be collect and the telescope focus onto a small blue box at the other side of the laboratory since the image of the beam remain the same clarity throughout the experiment it be a reasonable assumption to treat this systematic error a negligible consider the relative uncertainty of the experimental value for the rydberg constant a weight average of the two can be establish the value of r ∞ calculate from λ red have an error ten time small that than of the value calculate from λ blue use this weight we find r ∞ 10 1.11×10 7 +1.0×10 7 11 ± 10 0.01×10 7 +0.1×10 7 which yield a final weight value of the constant r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 this result lie 0.24 from the accepted value and encompasses the accepted value within the error give measure the wavelength of red and blue light from their emission line in the balmer series from a hydrogen lamp allow for two value of the rydberg constant to be calculate these be r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 use the measure wavelength of red light and r ∞ 1.0 ± 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 use the wavelength of blue light the value lie either side of the accepted value and combine give a weight experimental average of the rydberg constant a r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 effective use of the student pasco model sp-9268 spectrometer to measure the wavelength of light enable a final value of the rydberg constant to be calculate to within 0.24 of the accepted value careful consideration of error and their propagation be crucial in ensure that an accurate result could be calculate the technique use to minimise error such a practise the set-up and alignment of the spectrometer cover the apparatus to block out background light and position the hydrogen lamp such that the intensity of the diffract beam be a large a possible be successful in keep the error relativity low poor experimental technique when measure the wavelength of blue light lead to a large random error the misalignment of the hydrogen lamp and collimator slit result in an increase in background light and consequently a decrease in intensity of the diffract beam both consequently increase the overall uncertainty in the width of each beam and so the error be large to improve on the experimental technique use in this experiment more data should be take across a range of diffraction grate with more data the apparent background noise may be able to be separate and potentially completely remove from the error in the reading diffraction grate with slit space 300 line per millimetre may allow for high order beam to be observe and hence the uncertainty of the gradient

focus the telescope to a distance object make sure the x see through the telescope be very clear set up the hydrogen lamp and adjust the collimator so the x be on focus to the center of the strip of

35,GS_MJV182_Redacted,this investigation involve the determination of rydberg 's constant by mean of use a grate spectrometer to measure the angular displacement of diffract spectral line from a hydrogen lamp first calculate the wavelength of these spectral line and then use the value of these wavelength to calculate value for the rydberg constant the determination by this method produce the accurate result of 1.10±0.04 ×10 7 m −1 1.09± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 thus it be conclude that the set of data from the red diffract spectral line produce the data with the least amount of experimental uncertainty when an electromagnetic emission be diffract whether it be from distant star or a sodium lamp the various wavelength of the emission be diffract at different angle this therefore produce a spectrum of all the wavelength present in the emission where the spectrum will be 'continuous for a solid emitter such a heat metal filament -containing a continuum of wavelength of vary intensity however in the case of electron in heat or electrically excite gas the excitement and follow relaxation of the electron between the discrete energy level of the gas atom cause the spectrum to contain only specific wavelength -those that relate to the size of the discrete energy gap that the electron transition over this be give by λ hc e where λ be the wavelength h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light and e be size of the discrete energy gap these be call 'emission line spectrum from the spectral pattern they produce when examine use a spectrometer a spectrometer produce this spectrum by collimate a thin sliver of light from the source use either a lens or mirror and then passing the re-sulting beam through either a grate to diffract it or a prism to refract it each wavelength in the beam will diffract or refract at a different angle thus produce a spectrum spectroscopy have be use for analysis in chemistry physic and astronomy all the way since the early 19th century when joseph von fraunhofer first use a diffraction grate to produce a spectrum of the sun 's visible light which appear a a continuous spectrum with thin dark gap in certain area these be later determine to be certain element in the sun 's corona absorb discrete wavelength of the sun 's radiation to excite their electron to high energy level thus reduce the intensity of the sun 's light at these wavelength -i.e the dark gap this investigation u a grate spectrometer the same concept a that originally developed by fraunhofer to measure the wavelength of spectral line in the balmer series emit by a hydrogen lamp these can then be use to deduce the rydberg constant a fundamental constant which relates the the spectral line of an emission spectrum to their wavelength niels bohr in his hypothesis for the model of an atom define the rydberg constant r ∞ in term of various fundamental physical constant where m e be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light h be planck 's constant and α be the fine structure constant -which be itself a combination of other fundamental constant maximum of an interference pattern occur when the phase difference between two ray be an integer multiple m of 2π the phase difference can also be express a the path difference of the two ray multiply by 2π λ where λ be the wavelength of the interfere ray 1 and since the path difference be just the slit separation d multiply by sinθ where θ be the angle of diffraction thus eliminate 2π here it can be see that sinθ be directly proportionate to m call the order number thus by measure the angle that the maximum appear at and know the slit separation of the diffraction grate the wavelength of the refract light can be determine the rydberg formula relates the transition wavelength λ of hydrogen to the integer n and p which represent the discrete energy level of the excite and relaxed state of the atom respectively the balmer series refers to the series of electron transition from an excite energy state of n 3 4 5 • • • ∞ to a relaxed state of p 2. the rydberg constant can then be calculate use the balmer transition wavelength value determine use the grate spectrometer the follow be a diagram of the path travel by the light in the spectrometer the emission from the source be pas through a narrow slit where a collimator convert the light into a parallel beam after then passing through the grate at normal incidence part of the diffract beam can be focus through a camera onto the center of a cross-hair x shape 1. the eyepiece lens be adjust to focus on the cross hair then the camera focus on a distant object -to imitate parallel light 2. the telescope be then set to be align with the axis of the collimator 0 • of angular displacement and the hydrogen lamp position in front of the slit so a to illuminate it 3. the focus of the collimator be adjust until the image of the slit on the cross hair be a sharp a possible and the telescope position so the slit be in alignment with the center of the cross hair 4. the grate be move through precisely 90 • and the grate place in the holder the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit be visible in the eyepiece -this indicates that the grate be at an angle of 45 • with the incident beam from the lamp and the telescope 5. the telescope be rotate through 45 • back to be in parallel with the incident beam on the grate 6. the angular displacement from this point to the diffract spectral line of red light be then record a a function of their order of magnitude the same be do for the set of diffract blue and violet spectral line from the linear regression analysis of the slope in figure 2 the standard error in the gradient of the slope be 0.000225 0.0012 0.00271 for the red blue and violet spectral line respectively these along with the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate can be use to calculate the overall error in the value obtain for the rydberg constant here be an example calculation for the 'red line set of data the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate be take a ±2 a state by the manufacturer thus d slope slope 0.000225 0.0522 0.00431 6 therefore the value determine for the rydberg constant via the 'red line data be 1.10 ± 0.02 × 10 7 m −1 the same process apply to the 'blue and 'violet data set give rydberg constant value of 1.10 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 1.09 ± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 these result be notably accurate the calculate error in each obtain value account for the difference between the calculate value and the real know value of 1.097 × 10 7 for the 'red set of data the error in the diffraction grate turn out to be the most significant source of uncertainty whereas for the 'blue and 'violet spectral line data the error in the slope be found to be high than the diffraction grate uncertainty these two data set have a high standard error could be due to a different hydrogen lamp be use for them a the first lamp blew while we be take data the hydrogen lamp be also move slightly during the measure of the blue line data which could have very slightly affected the path of the beam through the slit into the camera this could have be improve by use clamp to secure the lamp and spectrometer tightly to the worktop only duplicate reading be take for the angular displacement reading the precision of the data point could have be improve by increase this to at least 4 repeat measurement of the data set the three obtain value for the rydberg constant via this diffraction grate experiment be 1.10 ± 0.02 × 10 7 1.10 ± 0.04 × 10 7 and 1.09 ± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 this method have thus be an effective mean to determine the value of the rydberg constant a the widely accepted correct value of the constant 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 lie within the range each calculate value 's error margin in order to reduce the level of uncertainty in the future the experiment should be carry out with the hydrogen lamp and grate

36,GS_HDP206_Redacted,in this paper i will present the method and result for an experiment with a grate spectrometer the purpose be to calculate a value of the rydberg constant by shin a hydrogen lamp through a grate spectrometer by measure the diffraction angle with the spectrometer the transition wavelength for hydrogen can be calculate with the wavelength and the transition level it be possible to calculate the rydberg constant and it uncertainty to get sufficient amount of statistical data we measure several transition from the balmer series from the transition 3→2 and 4→2 we get an average value for the rydberg constant 𝑹 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 a difference of 3.6 from the accepted value he motive for this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ from the balmer series for hydrogen the experimental method in the laboratory be base on a grate spectrometer use a hydrogen lamp a light source hot or electrically excite gas emit photon in which the emission be concentrate at a few well define wavelengths-called `` emission line spectrum `` our light source u hydrogen gas which by an electrical current through the gas excites photon at specific wavelength four of these wavelength be in the visible spectrum and can be measure with the spectrometer this device u a lens to produce a collimate beam of light make of several distinct wavelength which be disperse with a grate and split into it component wavelength with each separate wavelength head in different direction determine by the relationship the disperse light beam be then focus and view with an eyepiece in this way the various wavelength can be determine by measure the angle at which the light beam be disperse the balmer series for hydrogen represent a series of energy level for orbital electron when an electron make a transition from an initial state of high energy to a state of low energy the atom emits a photon of energy if we know the energy level and the correspond wavelength the rydberg constant can be calculate a diagram of the grate spectrometer use in this experiment be show in figure 1. the grate behaves like a multi-slit aperture with many closely space slit with a separation between adjacent slit of d. the light beam be diffract by the grate at an angle θ thus for neighbour light beam the path difference be d sin θ a show in the inset in fig 1 the light beam will interfere constructively only if the path difference be an integer number of wavelength where m be call the order number the ray from all slit will interfere constructively at the angle where m be an integer produce a principal maximum in that direction transition wavelength for hydrogen be give by the rydberg formula where n and p be integer which represent the energy level of the initial and final state for transition in the atom respectively 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant which have the accepted value 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 these transition be illustrate in fig 2. to set up the spectrometer we use a sodium lamp since it provide a stable light source without go warm the spectrometer use in the experiment consist of a collimator grate camera lens and eyepiece mount on a rotatable foundation a show in fig 3. the angle of the telescope camera lens and eyepiece relative to the collimator can be read with a vernier scale an illustration sketch of the spectrometer source http //spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys273/manual/diffract.html first we focus the eyepiece on the cross wire and the camera lens such that an object 10 m away be focus on the cross wire furthermore we align the telescope with the axis of the collimator with the sodium lamp close to the slit the collimator be focus on the slit to get the grate accurately parallel to the collimate beam the follow procedure be follow the telescope be rotate 90 deg and clamped in position place a grate with 78.8 line per mm in the holder turn the grate table until a reflect image of the entrance slit be see in the eyepiece with the vernier scale the grate be rotate 45 deg so that it be parallel to the collimate beam with the setup we could see 3 distinct spectral line for hydrogen with the red a the brightest light blue aqua slightly dimmer and violet not a bright since red and light blue be easy to measure accurately we focus on measure them in our experiment the slit width be measure to 0.07 deg at the 0 order for the red line we start from order -7 and move to order 5 reading the vernier scale at every order for the light blue line we measure order -9 -8 -7 0 3 4 5 and 6 since the measurement at the high order give more accurate reading and it save time the uncertainty of reading the vernier scale be estimate to 0.03 deg the data for the red emission line be show in fig 4. use the line fit we can calculate the wavelength with equation 1 obtain the wavelength 𝜆 694 ± 3 10 −9 𝑚. from the accepted value of the balmer series the transition 3→2 give red light at a wavelength 656 10 −9 𝑚. since this be the low energy level in the visible spectrum we can conclude that this be the transition we measure to calculate the rydberg constant we use our measure wavelength in equation 2 where n 3 and p 2. the result be the value 𝑅 ∞ 1.037 ± 0.014 10 7 𝑚 −1 the same procedure can be apply to the measurement of light blue aqua see fig 5 for data which yield the wavelength 𝜆 492 ± 0.2 10 −9 𝑚. from the accepted value of the balmer series the transition 4→2 give aqua light at a wavelength 486 10 −9 𝑚. this be very close to our measure value relative to the neighbour transition thus we can conclude that this be the transition we measure in the same manner the rydberg constant can be calculate but with n 4 and p 2. give the value 𝑅 ∞ 1.084 ± 0.014 10 7 𝑚 −1 combine the value we get the mean rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 with a percentage uncertainty of 1.9 the large error be from the measure value for the red emission line a potential source for this could stem from a difference in the setup since the red emission line be do in the first lab session and the aqua line in the second it be therefore possible that there be a difference in the setup such a the grate not be perfectly align for the aqua light we be able to measure order -9 and 6 which give a more accurate measurement of the wavelength furthermore there be a systematic error related to the reading of the vernier scale which have an estimate error of 0.03 deg in addition the light pollution in the laboratory mainly from other desk lamp make the reading harder another source of systematic error be the hydrogen lamp which contains small quantity of other material this effect be neglect a small since we do not see any other bright emission line the uncertainty can also be a result random error which can be reduce by take more measurement this be not do due to the long setup and time set of to the other part of the experiment the result of 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 be relative close to the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ 1.09737316 10 7 𝑚 −1 this suggests that our experiment agrees with the theory and the accepted value of the rydberg constant however there be a difference in the value and an associate uncertainty a review of the method of the experiment be therefore important in this experiment the set up have a substantial impact on how easy and accurate the measurement be we felt that our setup give well result in the second session where we measure the aqua light since we be able to see high order and get more consistent data this uncertainty could have be avoid by use the same setup but this be not possible due to time shortage in the first session on the same manner with more time we would be able to get more measurement which would reduce our random error furthermore a potential solution to minimize the systematic error be to use a ccd camera to find the principal maximum emission line and a magnetic sensor to measure the angle that the spectrometer be rotate at the aim of the experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant from the balmer series for hydrogen the experimental method be base on a grate spectrometer use a hydrogen lamp a light source through this method we obtain the result of 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 and a percentage uncertainty of 1.9 compare to the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ 1.09737316 10 7 𝑚 −1 our result be relative good at a percentage difference of 3.6 however the uncertainty of 1.9 could have be reduce by minimize our systematic error and reduce the random error by take more measurement some of the important factor with the experiment be the setup of the spectrometer and take consistently accurate measurement with the eyepiece and the vernier scale a potential solution to minimize this systematic error be to digitalize the measurement of the emission line and diffraction angle the spectrometer enables u to highly accurate measure spectrum and line of light it be widely use in science astrophysics and engineering and it find have help u explain the element of faraway object the gaseous layer of space and even the composition of the universe,superficial,bal

observe for simplicity only the balmer series be analyse a they lie in the visible spectrum only two spectral line be observe the two line be red and blue with the red line be more intense hence we deduce that the red line be hα 3 to 2 and the blue line be hβ 4 to 2 a the former be more probable than the other and the remain balmer line be not intense enough to be observe a their transition be very improbable 1 use this data the rydberg constant can be calculate for each balmer line observe a grate be a large number of slit equally space separate by a distance d. light passing through a grate hence undergoes diffraction for a light of wavelength 𝜆 a principal maximum occurs when phase difference between two ray be an integral multiple n of 2π 2 in the case of 2 neighbour beam from the figure one see that the path difference be dsinө hence the spectrometer be use to measure different value sinө correspond to their respective value of n. the value of d depends on the grate use hence use the data from the spectrometer and equation a the wavelength of light can be calculate the grate constant n implies that there be n number of slit per unit length hence the distance between each slit be the inverse of the grate constant the wavelength can then be substitute into the rydberg formula state in the 'theory section and the rydberg constant can be calculate one must deduce the value of n and p for the various balmer line observe base on their relative intensity the improbability of a transition be proportional to how large the transition be hence reduce the intensity of light observe a the transition get high upon my lab partner and i take two individual reading for every fringe the maximum difference between our reading be 3 minute 0.05 degree hence error in the angle measurement be 0.05 degree the value of angle in degree be know to 4 significant digit hence all value will be write upto 4 significant digit with the error in angle ө be know we can calculate

rydberg constant be inaccurate only by 0.28 but the theoretical value do not lie in the error range of the calculate value this experiment be very useful and important because it taught u to use a spectrometer which be a very important instrument and have a wide number of u in various field it be also one of the most accurate instrument in the laboratory this experiment could be improve if the telescope have a high resolve power so the crosshair can be place more accurately by reduce ambient light the slit can be small in size thereby make measurement more accurate,extended,bal
38,GS_QMC249_Redacted,the rydberg constant symbol r∞ be measure use a grate spectrometer with a hydrogen lamp use a a source the wavelength of visible light emit by the hydrogen lamp be determine use simple diffraction grate theory which allow the value for r∞ to be determine use the rydberg formula for hydrogen specifically the formula pertain to the balmer series in hydrogen this result in a value of 11050000 ± 30000 m −1 which corresponds to a fractional uncertainty of about 3 part per thousand i n this experiment a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the emission spectrum of hydrogen be due to atom transition between atomic energy level and can be broken down into distinct spectral series one of which be the balmer series the balmer series pertains to transition to the 2nd energy level from high energy level and be of interest since it also involves emission of wavelength within the visible spectrum the wavelength in the balmer series be determine by examine the diffraction of the wavelength due to the grate then by use the rydberg formula which relates the wavelength of photon emit and the energy level involve in the transition a value for the rydberg constant can therefore be obtain for a diffraction grate where m be an integer call the order number λ be the wavelength of the light passing through the grate d be the slit separation and θ be the angle between the diffract ray and the grate 's normal vector in the bohr model of the atom electron orbit a positively charge nucleus where the electron can transition between stable circular orbit of different energy call energy level an atom can radiate energy in the form of a photon by an electron transition down from one energy level with energy to another with a low energy 1 p. 1318 for hydrogen-like atom which only have one electron the transition wavelength of the photon emit be give by the rydberg formula in the case of hydrogen and the balmer series z 2 and n 1 2 so equation 2 becomes the balmer formula where n 2 have be replace with n. the rydberg constant can be express a where α be the fine structure constant m e be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be planck 's constant use this result in a predict value for r ∞ of about 10973731.6 m −1 this value can be insert into equation 3 along with select value of n where n 2 and be an integer to predict what wavelength be emit in the balmer series and their colour table 1 above show these iii experimental method the grate spectrometer be set up a show in fig 1 and calibrate with a sodium lamp a the light source and a grate with a space of 2001 line per inch a sodium lamp be use for calibration instead of a hydrogen lamp since the calibration require that the light source be switch on continuously for a period of time which would cause the hydrogen lamp to overheat have it be use after calibration the sodium lamp be switch with a hydrogen lamp when first view the emission spectrum it be observe that the visible spectral line be red aqua and blue correspond to n 3 4 and 5 respectively in the balmer series violet line correspond to n 6 be visible but extremely faint therefore it be decide to collect data on only red aqua and blue line since it be thought that attempt to collect data on the violet line would be too time consume angle measurement be take one colour at a time begin with red then aqua and lastly blue since keep the hydrogen lamp for too long would cause it to overheat we take reading in time period 15 minute long and allow it to cool for 10 minute before take more reading the grate spectrometer be mount on a vernier scale which measure angle to the near arcminute or one-sixtieth of a degree the scale be very difficult to read so a magnify glass be use to assist in this the angle at the zeroth order/central maximum be measure for red line after which the telescope the camera and eyepiece would be turn until the next red line be encounter which then would be the angle at the first order maximum this would continue until no more red line would be visible at which point the telescope would be move back to the central maximum and the same process would be carry out in the other direction this time with the angle correspond a negative order this process would also be carry out for the aqua and blue line base on equation 1 it can be see that by plot sin θ against m for line of a certain colour where θ would be the difference between the angle at central maximum and the angle at a certain order m a linear graph would be obtain where it gradient would be equal to λ d this mean that the wavelength of the light can be determine by multiply the gradient by the slit separation d. figure 2 be a plot of sin θ against order m for red aqua and blue line the gradient with their associate error of these line be 0.05197 83 0.0385 27 and 0.03422 92 respectively multiply by slit separation d of about 1.27 × 10 −5 m −1 we obtain the wavelength λ red 660 ± 1 nm λ aqua 488 ± 3 nm λ blue 434 ± 1 nm compare these wavelength to the predict value in table 1 indicate that the red line in the balmer series very likely represent the transition of an electron from n 3 the aqua line from n 4 and the violet line from n 5. would result in a linear graph with a gradient of r ∞ the rydberg constant fig 3 λ and it gradient be equal to 11050000 ± 30000 m −1 therefore we have obtain the final value with uncertainty for the rydberg constant this represent a fractional uncertainty of 3 part per thousand in comparison with the 2014 codata recommend value of 10973731.568508 65 m −1 2 our obtain value be within 0.7 percent but the recommend value do not fall within the experimental error bound this likely indicates that some source of error have not be take into account it take a long time for the grate spectrometer to be calibrate which be hamper by the spectral line gradually move below or above the line of sight of the telescope a θ increase this implies that there be a slant in some part of the grate spectrometer a a result only six reading be able to be take for each colour if more reading be take the error obtain could have be less moreover some systematic error be likely to have be introduce a a result of this misalignment another potential source for error from within the apparatus be if the grate and collimator or the camera and eyepiece be not perfectly parallel to the other this would result in deviation of the angle measure thereby contribute to the error the absolute error use for θ in the error analysis be ±1 arcminute since the vernier scale have an absolute error of ±0.5 arcminute and θ represent the difference between two reading despite this when take a reading from the vernier scale it be often difficult to decide which point on the vernier scale aligns with the main scale so the absolute error be probably underestimated the air density may be important since air can cause light to refract although over a short distance a in the spectrometer any error it contributes should be negligible in this report we examine the balmer series for hydrogen and present an experimentally obtain value for the rydberg constant which be reasonably close to the accepted value despited that the fractional uncertainty of three part per thousand be ten time the theoretical precision of three part per ten thousand for a grate spectrometer which be partly due to misalignment of the spectrometer moreover the accepted value be n't within the error bound obtain far indication that there be source of error not take into account or otherwise underestimated this experiment could be improve if the alignment of the spectrometer be improve a well a by take more reading,deep,bal
39,GS_GOO868_Redacted,through method of spectroscopy we be able to calculate a value for the rydberg constant a constant that be use when calculate the wavelength of emit light from hydrogen atom and more specifically the wavelength from the balmer series the balmer series that we measure be the photon from electron that have de-excited from a high energy level to the second energy level of a hydrogen atom a a result our procedure be to use a hydrogen source and for the light to be diffract through a grate the light from the diffraction grate be then measure and for the wavelength to be calculate from their respective angle by calculate the wavelength of the light we be able to produce a value for the rydberg constant 1.69562 × 10 6 m -1 ± 3.13799 × 10 5 m -1 the true value of the rydberg constant however be 1.0973731568508 × 10 7 m -1 1 this constant be useful when investigate the bohr model 2 for atom and so provide a great initial investigation into the structure of atom at a more fundamental level n order to calculate a value for the rydberg constant we have to use a new technique to measure the wavelength of the emit light from the hydrogen source spectroscopy furthermore through this experiment we be able to look at the behaviour of light through a diffraction grate and how the component of the light emit be able to provide detail of the source and thus the structure of hydrogen atom to complete this experiment and to understand the implication of such an experiment the theoretical background must be understood since there be an equation relate the number of slit per unit length in the diffraction grate and the wavelength of the light through the grate the different wavelength be produce at vary angle additionally since there be an equation relate wavelength and the rydberg constant these measurement that we be able to take allow for this constant to be calculate we use a spectrometer for this experiment and by use a hydrogen lamp the correct measurement be take also due to the way in which the hydrogen lamp depletes so quickly the sodium lamp be use for the initial calibration this experiment involve use a vernier scale and so it be of vital importance to measure the value accurately especially when consider some of the value be of such a small value and difference the balmer series be of great importance to research and so understand this characteristic of light from a hydrogen source have implication on research be conduct at the moment the abundance of hydrogen within the universe also make this series vitally important when it come to the classification of star and other cosmological object 3 the nature of light allows for certain prediction to be make when light interacts with an obstacle and thus due to this predictability the characteristic of a light source can be measure the grate itself be compose of equally space slit of which there be a large number n and with each slit separate by a distance d. the light then pas through each slit for it then to interfere with light from other slit within the grate the way in which light interferes with other wave involves the phase difference 𝜙 of the light during it interaction with other wave this cause superposition between the wave and thus determines at which angle there be maximum and minimum this phase difference can then be show through these equation where 𝜆 be the wavelength of light emit from the source m be the order number and 𝜃 be the angle of the light from the normal to the diffraction grate consequently with vary wavelength be emit from the transition of electron to the second energy level the angle will vary and so the different wavelength can be detect to ensure however that each line could be detect consider a second wavelength λ. a a result a relationship between the two wavelength can be show through these two equation where δ𝜆 be the difference between the two wavelength 𝜆 and λ. the condition of this value for this equation be such that δ𝜆 ≪ 𝜆. therefore from this equation it reveals how the resolution of the image be dependent upon n the number of slit in the diffraction grate a a result of these equation we be able to show that through the method of spectroscopy it be possible to observe the different wavelength of light at vary angle from the normal to the diffraction grate these different wavelength be be emit from a hydrogen atom and can be related between the initial and final energy state of the atom this be due to the way in which the great the energy transition the shorter the wavelength this relationship be from these equation and definition where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 3 n be the initial state and p be the final state with both be integer α the fine structure constant 4 𝑚 𝑒 the mass of the electron h the planck 's constant e the charger of an electron and 𝜀 0 the permittivity of free space for the balmer series that we observe the final state be the hydrogen atom 's second energy state and so the value of p would be 2 in equation 2 be the x-axis from this the gradient can be calculate therefore to calculate a value for the rydberg constant it would be to calculate the gradient of the line produce from our data and thereby determine a value for the rydberg constant in order to complete this experiment the setup of the spectrometer must be complete so a to ensure that all the measurement take be accurate in addition due to the extreme sensitivity of the experiment and the small value that we dealt with the setup of this experiment be vital to the success of the experiment for this experiment it be important to get a many data point a possible so a to ensure that the value we end with be reliable and accurate also due to the way in which our setup be design the hydrogen lamp have a limited amount of usage to overcome this problem a sodium lamp be use to calibrate and setup the spectrometer due to the way in which the calibration only require the zeroth order from the diffraction grate which be the same regardless of the source use so a to focus the eyepiece that we use we focus the eyepiece on the cross wire this guaranteed that each measurement we take be from a precise point that could be see clearly by ourselves if it be to be a blur image of the cross wire it would be difficult to determine from which point we take the measurement and if we be n't able to take the measurement from the same point of the strip it would make each measurement unfairly measure when compare to the other measurement we take to then focus the lens of the eye piece we align the telescope of the spectrometer onto a distant object approximately 5 to 10 metre from the telescope this allows for a clear image to be see when measure the spectral line however such focus allows for a minimal parallax between the spectral line that we be measure and the cross wire within the telescope follow the previous process we have to ensure that the collimator within the spectrometer have be properly focus a a result by put the sodium lamp in front of slit and the telescope align with single spectral line produce since there 's no grate the collimator lens should be focus to make the image of the spectral line a clear and sharp image this allows for clear measurement of the spectral line to be take due to the ability of the cross wire to precisely line up with the centre of the spectral line to ensure that the spectrometer be setup correctly it be vital to ensure that certain screw of the spectrometer be left alone and thus make it easy for accurate measurement to be take and for the spectrometer to be secure in place 5 for the set up of the spectrometer we record the initial value of the telescope 's angle when with no grate a single spectral line be see and we then move the telescope through by 90 degree we then place the grate into the holder on the grate table and move the table round until we could see the reflection of the spectral line in the eyepiece of the telescope we then adjust the height of the table to allow for the whole spectral line to be see fully the value of the angle at this point be then record and we then move the grate table back through 45 degree for it to then be normal to the incident ray on the diffraction grate the spectrometer we use can be see in the image below 6 after use the sodium lamp for the calibration we use the hydrogen lamp so a to collect the appropriate data from the balmer series we also kept move the hydrogen lamp 's position in front of the slit to try and allow for a much light a possible thus make it easy for u to collect reading when collect the data we try to eliminate a much background light a possible to ensure that we be not see incorrect reading furthermore due to similar experiment with similar setup be conduct within close proximity of our own experiment we decide to ensure that we block each light with black card this be important because since the telescope would move round to detect the image 3.1 this be a photo of the spectrometer use in this experiment and a can be see at the centre of the image the grate table that held the grate table be place the screw underneath the grate table control the height of the table however a screw behind the telescope the right side 's eyepiece telescope allows for small movement to be take the slow motion drive the screw either side of each telescope focus the lens of their respective telescope and the screw underneath the telescope keep the scale in place spectral line it become important to block these other source of light that may have come into view for this experiment we measure the angle from the centre of the spectral line for each colour and we continued to move through the order until the intensity of the light be too dark to be able to determine it colour however it be important to try and measure a many different colour and consequently wavelength a possible from this the aim be to try and produce a more accurate gradient and then from this a well value for the rydberg constant furthermore after align the telescope but before we take our reading we have to turn off the hydrogen lamp to guarantee the lamp would n't deplete and thus allow for more reading to be take during our laboratory session the specific setup that we use to measure the order of the different wavelength can be see in the diagram below and use this setup a spectrometer can be use so a to collect accurate data for the experiment the data that we collect for each colour can be see in the figure below and with each of these data point have an associate error that be carry through in the final calculation we repeat measurement for the aqua because it appear at the time that we have carry out our measurement incorrectly the true value can be show below 7 from this data it show that the blue data we collect be inaccurate in term of it closeness to the actual value despite the error be extremely large this be due to the diagram 3.1 this be the diagram of the experimental setup that we use the first lens the ray interact with be from the collimator with the blue dot line act a the diffraction grate the second lens then act a the camera with the third eyepiece belonging to the eye piece from this setup we be able to measure the angle of the light from the diffraction grate error be small in term of each initial measurement however when carry through in term of the error of the end result a large error be produce this disparity may have be a a result of inaccurate measurement because when measure the angle we may have misalign the cross wire over the line and so incorrect measurement in addition since we complete these measurement in a separate session the calibration of the spectrometer may have be incorrect and thus cause the disparity between the value on the other hand the data we collect for the red and aqua spectral line be near real value and hence accurate measurement since the real value fell within the error of each data set the rydberg constant can therefore be calculate and be show in the graph below however when look at the graph it be clear to see that there be an anomaly the furthest left data point it be know that this be the anomalous data point because the line need to have a negative gradient this far emphasis the inaccuracy of the blue spectral line data and the need to have collect more data however more importantly to have the spectrometer correctly calibrate this be evident because if the anomalous data be remove the gradient would change and from this a value for the rydberg constant be found 𝑅 ∞ 9.891682 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 ± 3.69817 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 and this value be much closer to the real value and although it do not have the real value within the error bar it be significantly closer to the real value a a result have more data set for other wavelength would have produce a more accurate value of the rydberg constant the aim of this experiment be to gain a value for the rydberg constant which be achieve however unless you remove the anomaly from the data we collect an inaccurate value be produce additionally due to two data point have much well accuracy and precision it reveals how when conduct the second set of experiment for the blue spectral line the spectrometer be setup incorrectly this experiment also provide u with the ability to use and understand this new technique of spectroscopy this be important because it also provide the platform to conduct far experiment in the future when conduct far experiment in other area of physic the theory of this experiment give the background to this experiment and thus allow for certain measurement to be take to allow for characteristic of a hydrogen atom to be measure and understood this balmer series be still important to modern research and so to understand it origin be important the success of this experiment be limited however because due to the inaccuracy and disparity of some of the data point the rydberg constant 's value come out to be inaccurate in comparison to the desire value nonetheless if these data point be remove an accurate result would be found the failure of this experiment be in these inaccurate data point and so to improve certain step can be take to improve accuracy for example the error could have be calculate by measure either side of the spectral line and so the error be half the range of these two value and then the standard error be calculate from all the value we measure in addition we could have take more repeat thereby produce more reliable data and thus make it easy to find the correct value a darker environment could have be make and hence reduce disturbance from the background however the main improvement would be to have spent more time on the setup of the spectrometer this improvement guarantee that there be more accuracy for each data point a well a precision because it reduces the possibility of there be an original offset that then make all value measure incorrect this experiment allow u to achieve certain goal in term of data collection and accuracy however from this experiment we be able to see the way in which the rydberg constant relates to physical attribute in the hydrogen atom and a a result learn more about the bohr model of the atom and the implication this have within the structure of an atom,superficial,the
40,GS_DAR896_Redacted,the follow paper explores how an optical diffraction-grating spectrometer which investigate visible spectral line of the hydrogen balmer series be use to determine rydberg 's constant use the precise set-up equipment reliable measurement of spectral line for several order of diffraction be obtain both red and blue spectral line be independently measure and investigate to estimate a value of rydberg 's constant these value be then compare with the accepted theoretical value from quantum mechanic graphical and computational analysis be then use to determine the estimate value for rydberg 's constant the observe red and blue spectral line produce a value of 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 respectively when compare to the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 the respective percentage error produce for rydberg 's constant be 0.38 and 2.67 the importance of investigate the hydrogen balmer series and subsequently determine the rydberg constant to high precision be most relevant in astronomy this be partly because hydrogen be the most abundant element in the universe 1 thus when study celestial body such a star measurement can then be use to identify that specific hydrogen process such a that cause the hydrogen balmer series be take place the importance of this experiment therefore stem from be able to well understand sub-atomic process which we observe and use every day in physic the various spectrum which have be observe be what lead to the study of atomic physic and quantum mechanic 1 the experimental value obtain in this experiment can therefore be compare with the accepted theoretical value for rydberg 's constant hence this could check the validity of the accepted value and be use to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the experimental procedure hence this could lead to a method of find way to improve the accuracy and resolution obtain when take astronomical reading the various series create be due to emission and absorption process in atom which create sequence such a the balmer and lyman series in hydrogen these series result from electron in the hydrogen atom transition from high state of quantum number to stable quantum state n 2 and n 1 respectively 1 due to spontaneous emission these transition reduce the electron energy by discreate amount which cause monoenergetic photon to be emit with discreate wavelength the underlie physic process take place in this experiment be the emission of monoenergetic packet of light due to orbital electron transition which follow the hydrogen balmer series and diffraction here a hydrogen lamp act a the light source and a diffraction grate spectrometer be then use to diffract the light use these instrument the monochromatic wavelength of light emit in the hydrogen balmer series for different electron transition be found this allow u to estimate a value for the rydberg constant use the rydberg equation the hydrogen lamp emits light by heating the hydrogen gas 2 which cause hydrogen atom to become excite a an orbital electron transition to a high quantum state consequently the electron shortly spontaneously emits back to the original stable quantum state during this electronic transition a light photon of monochromatic wavelength be emit because of the transition between monoenergetic level use a spectrometer to determine rydberg 's constant by investigate the hydrogen balmer series these light wave of single wavelength then diffract through a diffraction grate to create an inte1ference pattern on a screen due to the superposition of diffract light wave the theo1y of these process be described far in section ii the rest of this repo1t will describe fuither the experimental and theoretical method use to detennine rydberg 's constant and then draw conclusion from those find the discreate energy of a photon spontaneously emit by a hydrogen atom in the balmer series be give by where his planck 's constant and f be the frequency of the photon emit in the balmer series this energy be lose by the hydrogen atom a an orbital electron in an excite quantum state spontaneously de-excites to quantum state n 2. thus the energy of the monoenergetic photon emit be equal to the energy difference between the two quantum state where e1 be the initial energy of the hydrogen atom and ei be the final energy the monochromatic wavelength of light emit by the hydrogen atom in the balmer series give by 3 where c be the speed of light in a vacuum can be found by equate i and 2 to obtain .. he/ ei-ei 4 balmer also developed a fo1mula in 1885 to measure the wavelength .. of the balmer series where n be integer 1 2 3 ... and c be the balmer constant rydberg generalize this in 1889 for the entire emission spectrnm of hydrogen a where r be the rydberg constant nf be the final quantum state and ni be the initial quantum state where nf= 2 for the hydrogen balmer series l when the monochromatic wavelength light

ingle wavelength emit in the hydrogen balmer series for red ni 3 and blue ni 4 light then equation 6 be use to dete1mine the estimate value for rydberg 's constant the experimental method use be able to significantly reduce many systematic and random enors effect on the experiment which be obse1ved this result in obtain a precise and accurate methodology which be a reproducible and reliable method for estimate rydberg 's constant accurate technique include computational analysis be then use to obtain the estimate value for rydberg 's constant and their associate e1rnrs the diffraction grate space be dete1mined use the provide number of line per unit length from the manufacturer 2 this info1mation give an approximate value of 12.7 x 10-0 m for the slit separation a similar slit separation be need for this experiment to obse1ve many order of diffraction since the range of wavelength for electro-magnetic wave in the visible light region be approximately 390 nm -700 nm a pasco student spectrometer such a in figure 1 be use to diffract the monoenergetic light emit by the hydrogen lamp and to obse1ve the spectral emission line produce eyepiece 3 to show how a spectrometer work when light be incident on it from the slit and how it can be use to find the wavelength of the light 2 a show in figure 2 the spectrometer which be use have a collimator and slit which cause the incoming light photon from the hydrogen lamp to become a parallel beam then the grate be use to diffract accord to 7 the n01mal incidence beam into an interference pattern of spectral line which be finally focus and obse1ved a an image in the telescope which be compose of the camera and eyepiece 2 the spectrometer be set-up follow the instruction provide in the 'first year laborato1y manual 2017 -2018 2 key point in the methodology be a follow • we focus the eyepiece on the crosswire so that an image roughly 30 cm away could be optimally obse1ved with limited eye strain this reduce random enor a the specti•al line obse1ved be more well define through the eyepiece • then the camera lens be focus on a distant object roughly 10 m away where incoming light could be assume to be parallel so that there be no parallax enor between the cross wire and image this reduce the random e1rnr due to human obse1vation associate significantly • then we align the collimator and telescope turn on and place the hydrogen lamp in an optimal position to the collimator slit then focus the collimator to see the slit image more sharply • after we move the telescope through 90 degree and inse1t ed the grate into the holder this meant the collimator and eyepiece be pe1pendicular then turn the grate table until there be an image of the slit in the eyepiece this meant that the grate table be at 45 degree to the incident beam from the collimator this be because the incident light be be reflect off the grate • at this point in the set-up there be a significant systematic enor with the specti•ometer which may have be due to the manufacturer it be notice that the vernier scale reading do n't match the theoretically expect value by roughly a 10-degree offset this could n't be resolve but didn t have a bearing on the result obtain • finally the grate be position pe1pendicular to the incident light from the collimator which be align with the telescope this be do by rotate the grate by 45 degree a centi•al zero order fringe be see through the telescope when it be align with the collimator which indicate the spectrometer be align properly the vernier scale be use to accurately measure the angle of diffraction which the telescope obse1ved at maximum position at least 5 order of diffraction left and 1ight of the centi•al zeroth order fringe be use beyond which the line specti•a become less visible and bluned to dete1mine the angle of diffraction the measure angle at each order of diffraction be subti•acted from the measure angle at the centi•al fringe 8 where 0m be the angle measure by the vernier scale at each respective order of diffraction and 0c be the angle measure by the vernier scale at the centi•al zeroth order fringe this provide the necessary measurement need to dete1mine the wavelength of light emit from the hydrogen balmer series which be investigate use equation 7 and consequently estimate the value ofrydberg 's constant use equation 6 the effect of background light on the clru•ity of the spectral line obse1ved in the telescope be a systematic enor which be reduce in the experiment .. this be achieve by make the environment a dark a possible with baniers use to stop any light reflect towards the specti•ometer a these measure result in well-defined specti•al line it be assume that any systematic e1rnr from this source be neglible also another identify systematic enor be the width of specti•al line which if significantly wide would need to be measure use the vernier scale at each edge an average value could then be use in equation 8 to find the angle of diffraction however when this be do for the high order of diffraction use the measure angle on the vernier scale show that the width be too small for resolution of the vernier scale hence this systematic e1rnr be also ignore during the expe1iment a be assume to be neglible the lamp be also position relatively close to the collimator slit so that the intensity of the spectral line obse1ved in the eyepiece be more well define also the lamp be align with the collimator and grate so that the maximum amount of light would enter the collimator slit finally to reduce background light the inside of the hydrogen lamp have a black cover to stop any other light enter the collimate slit another systematic error encounter during the experiment be a spectrometer misalignment this be notice when the grate be position at 45 degree to the incident beam when the collimator slit and telescope be perpendicular to each other it be expect that the vernier scale would show 45 degree difference between both the collimator and telescope a the incident light be reflect off the grate however while these relative position in the spectrometer be correct the vernier scale read a value which be 3.90 degree off the expect theoretical value this may have be a problem with the manufacturer a another spectrometer of the same type show a similar misalignment when be set-up however a this be a systematic error which do n't affect the angle of diffraction when the spectrometer be set-up this have no bearing on the calculation of rydberg 's constant thus the systematic error involve be ignore the misalignment of the spectrometer have no affect on the measure angle of diffraction because when use equation 8 the measure position θ m and θ c be relative to only each other the main source of random error which be introduce in the experiment be when take measurement of the angle diffract by line spectrum use the vernier scale while the vernier scale be highly precise the main random error associate with the measure equipment be the resolution of the vernier scale which be estimate to be 0.05 degree this random error be estimate by judging how many division on the vernier scale appear to be also correct and then halve this range which be the estimate random error use for this the actual resolution in angle which the vernier scale can measure of 0.017 degree be not use for this estimation because of human error limit the resolution of the method far than the equipment use when visually observe the vernier scale it be apparent that there be no clear and correct mark to use thus it be estimate that 6 mark on the vernier scale appear to be the possible correct mark the estimate error of 0.05 degree be then found by calculate the angle cover by half of those division the other main random error associate with this method of measure be human error due to incorrectly reading the vernier scale poor judgment to approximate this random error two observer independently measure the angle of diffraction the mean value be calculate a the average of the two reading the standard error be then calculate and use a the associate estimate of this random error finally to estimate the combine random error associate with each angle of diffraction the approximate random error be add to get the combine estimate error associate with each angle measure on the vernier scale then a the angle of diffraction be calculate use equation 8 the estimate random error of each respective angle measure θ m and θ c be add in quadrature a equation 7 be use to find the wavelength of light emit a part of the hydrogen balmer series the value and associate error of sin θ for each order of diffraction be found the value be found by inputting the angle of diffraction to find the associate error the follow formula be use where φ be the estimate error of each respective angle of diffraction this approximation for the error be use because φ be relatively small thus could assume that around θ the curve approach linearity this meant that the error above and below the value of sin θ be the same also since the value of θ be relatively small a small angle approximation also support this method of approximate the associate error use equation 7 to find the wavelength of light emit from the hydrogen balmer series meant a graph of sin θ against m the order of diffraction be use the slit separation d multiply by the gradient of the graph would hence provide the wavelength computational analysis be use to create and analyze these graph for blue and red light a show in figure 3 4 5 and 6. figure 5. the graph use to find the wavelength of red light use equation 7 it be clear that the method use be highly precise due to the clear linear relationship exhibit and the small deviation of point to the line of best fit also method of reduce systematic error appear to have be successful a there be a relatively small y-intercept this method provide wavelength of 473 ± 10.2 nm and 659 ± 0.761 nm for the blue and red light respectively however when this be compare to the actual value of 486 nm and 656 nm respectively 4 the estimate result for blue and red light do n't include the expect value in their estimate error this indicate that the associate random error may have be underestimated and some source of error may not have be identify and include in the experimental calculation use equation 6 and error calculation provide from source 2 the estimate value and associate error of rydberg 's constant for red light where the orbital electron spontaneously emits the red light from initial quantum state n i 3 and blue light where the orbital electron spontaneously emits the blue light from initial quantum state n i 4 be calculate the estimate value and associate error of rydberg 's constant be 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 for red light and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 for blue light compare to the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 the respective percentage error produce for rydberg 's constant be 0.38 and 2.67 however a the estimate value for the wavelength of blue and red light do n't include the expect value the estimate value for rydberg 's constant also do n't include the theoretical value the aim of this experiment be to determine the rydberg constant through investigate the hydrogen balmer series use a grate spectrometer this be achieve by use a pasco student spectrometer and hydrogen lamp the optical spectrometer be use to measure the angle of diffraction for multiple order for the red and blue light emit a part of the hydrogen balmer series graphical and computational analysis be then use to attain precise estimate value for rydberg 's constant the experiment provide estimate value for rydberg 's constant of 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 for red light and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 for blue light this be compare to the accepted theoretical value of rydberg 's constant of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 with red and blue light produce respective percentage error for rydberg 's constant of 0.38 and 2.67 the experiment be able to successfully reduce the main source of systematic error a show by the observe spectral line which be well define the misalignment of the spectrometer by 3.90 degree however be a systematic error which could n't be resolve during the experiment also the measurement take be highly accurate with the vernier scale be use to obtain high resolution reading and reduce human error significantly however the experiment do n't obtain estimate result which include the theoretical value of rydberg 's constant this indicate that the estimation of random error be n't a accurate a possible this may have be due to underestimate the random error associate with reading the vernier scale or it equati on of l ine of best f i t 0.05194 x 0.005208 ■ may have be a significant source of random error which be n't take into consideration to improve the experiment an align spectrometer should be use to repeat the method a the vernier scale may have be unprecise which be perceive a be misalign in the experiment which would be a significant random error which could n't be test for also a more sophisticated experimental set-up could be use such a a computer-aided spectrophotometer to obtain more accurate result this could also allow other wavelength of light from the hydrogen

41,GS_XMC918_Redacted,the uncertainty in the measurement of each angle be estimate simply by take several reading of each maximum and compare them to find a range the uncertainty use for each data point be then half the total range which be found to be 1/6 of a degree source of systematic error be mostly not possible for u to measure in the time available so for example we do not obtain enough measurement of maximum to both side of the centre to compare them and as how much error may be arise from slight asymmetry in the alignment of the spectrometer instead the result here be base on measurement just to one side of the centre and this error can not be quantify similarly other potential source of error such a atmospheric condition affect the optical property of the air and therefore alter the wavelength due to a potential change in the speed of light be not account for a these condition i.e humidity air pressure be not measure when the experiment be be carry out furthermore a other work be be do in the lab variation in background light could not be avoid meaning some data point may have underestimated uncertainty if background light be high when the measurement be take specifically to the setup we use the spectrometer be balance on a table which do not perfectly sit flat on the table we attempt to prevent it wobble while we make our measurement by place some paper under one of the leg but this do not seem to fully remedy the problem so it may have create some random error if it be not in exactly the same position for all the measurement the result we be able to obtain include only two wavelength of the balmer series a low wavelength be not visible with the set up use the two correspond to n value of 3 for the red light and 4 for the blue violet light which we assume to correspond to n=5 be visible only to the first maximum and so we be unable to gather enough data point to calculate a precise value for it wavelength and other colour be not visible at all a show in fig 2 and 3 the data fit extremely well to a linear relationship a predict by our model this allow u to calculate value for the wavelength of 6614762x10 -13 +/-7x10 -13 m for the red light and 47739x10 -11 +/-1x10 -11 m for the blue use 2 the mean value of the rydberg constant obtain from 3 be 11028400+/-100m -1 this do not agree with the accepted value of 10973731.6m -1 which would suggest that systematic error in the experiment have a significant impact however consider the individual value for the two different colour the red light give a value approximately 1 low than the accepted value while the blue light give one approximately 2 high rather than support the idea that it be cause by systematic error it instead implies that the problem be that random error be underestimated the most likely candidate for this phenomenon be the unstable table on which the spectrometer be balance mention in section iii it would explain why the two data set show very little error within themselves and yet the two data set both conflict with both one another and the accepted value it be possible that other source of error played their part such a background light and atmospheric condition however it seem less likely that these would have give such a clear divide between the two data set the unstable table would be more likely a the data set be take very close together give limited time for such a distinct change in humidity or pressure also background light fluctuate throughout the experiment with no chance of give such a distinct contrast in the two set of reading another contribution to the error in our result be likely not accounting for possible asymmetry in our set up by only measure to one side of the centre it be possible that if we have do so we would have notice the effect of the unstable table and have a chance of quantify the resultant error instead we be left with no way of state with any certainty whether this or another unidentified source of error lead to the issue in our final value use our method we be able to obtain a value for the rydberg constant which fell within 1 of the accepted value however a we underestimated the systematic error inherent in our set up our value conflict with the accepted value despite be so close in order to make it a useful measurement we would need to return to the experiment and thoroughly investigate and quantify the impact of all potential source of systematic error described in section iii once this be do it would be possible to both more confidently state which source of error cause the issue in this experiment and to repeat the experiment with well control and understand of these error to obtain a more accurate value of the rydberg constant another improvement that could likely give a significant increase in the accuracy and precision achievable would be if extra wavelength could be observe to increase the amount of data available this could be achieve either by change the source to one in which low wavelength be brighter and could be measure another possibility be to use other method of observation than the naked eye allow infra-red ultra violet or both to be observe in addition once again this would simply increase the amount of data available to use in calculation thereby reduce statistical error and give a more precise final

42,GS_BKZ271_Redacted,"electron in an atom undergo transition in between energy level in the atom when these transition be from a high energy state to a low state the excess energy be emit in the form of a photon of a certain wavelength for this experiment we use a hydrogen discharge lamp and a spectrometer the transition emit photon in the visible region of the spectrum be grouped together into the balmer series the wavelength of these spectral line can be measure by use a spectrometer to measure the angular position of the line and plot this position against the order of the spectral line the product of the slope of this plot and the slit separation give u the wavelength the initial and final energy level can be decide base on the colour of the spectral line a only certain wavelength

the light source be use be a hydrogen discharge lamp the a im of this experiment be to use the obtain data o n wavelength to accurately determine t he value of rydberg 's constant the diffraction

thus use equation 1 2 and 3 we get which mean here m be call the order number λ be the wavelength and d be the separation between two adjacent slit light of a give colour will be diffract at a specific angle for a give order all light ray of that colour will be parallel if the incident light ray be parallel light of a different colour be diffract at a different angle but it light ray will also be parallel accord to the theory quantum mechanic an electron bound to an atom can not have any value of energy rather it can only occupy certain state which correspond to certain energy level the formula define the energy level of a hydrogen atom be give by the equation e -e0/n 2 where e0 13.6 ev 1 ev 1.602×10 -19 joule and n 1,2,3… and so on the energy be express a a negative number because it take that much energy to unbind ionize the electron from the nucleus when an electron absorbs a photon it gain the energy of the photon because an electron bound to an atom can only have certain energy the electron can only absorb photon of certain energy if a photon have more energy than the binding energy of the electron then the photon will free the electron from the atom -ionizing it the electron once it have absorbed photon be now in an excite state an electron have a certain probability to drop from one excite state to a low i.e more negative energy level when an electron drop from a high level to a low level it shed the excess energy a positive amount by emit a photon the transition be classify into different series base on the energy of the emit photon for this

consist of focus the eyepiece on the cross wire such that the set be free of eye strain best do with both eye open next the camera lens be focus such that a distant object be focus onto the cross wire now the telescope be align with the collimator see figure 5 for the next part of calibration a sodium-vapour lamp be use the wavelength of the lamp be know to be an average of two line and be precisely 589.3nm this lamp be then place in front of the slit of the spectrometer the telescope be move through 90° and clamped and a grate be put in the holder this diffraction grate be one that have 80 lines/mm line per millimetre the grate be adjust to see a reflect image of the slit meaning the grate be at 45° with respect to the collimator beam once the image be centre on the cross wire the reading of the scale be note and the grate be rotate through precisely 45 degree thus set it at normal incidence the height of the image can also be adjust use the adjustment screw to centre it on the cross wire the spectrometer be now calibrate and set up to take measurement with a precision of under 0.3 or about ±0.2 nm for yellow-orange light 8 the aim of this part of the experiment be to use the spectrometer to measure the wavelength use the grate equation eqn 4 consider the angular separation of fringe from the central fringe to be θ. then measure θ for different value of m both positive and negative with the sign indicate the side of displacement left or right the width of the slit of the spectrometer can be adjust vary the intensity and hence the width of the observe spectral line refer to table 1 for measure value for both red and purple spectral line note the slit of the spectrometer be use be misalign cause the spectral line to be cut horizontally this however do not affect the measure process or the obtain value a the spectrometer be very precise and the hydrogen lamp be an emitter of pure wavelength single value or discreet table 1 from eqn 4 the grate use be 78.8 line per mm or 2001 line per inch thus give a value for 'd which be then use to calculate the wavelength of the light this be do for 3 different transitions-namely red blue and violet show below be the plot for the violet spectral line refer to appendix 2 for red spectral line 's data the wavelength of the line be then calculate use the gradient slope of the plot the error in the gradient and the slit separation d the wavelength of the red spectral line be calculate to be 678.9 ± 46.8 𝑛𝑚 and that of the violet spectral line be 443 ± 2.1 𝑛𝑚 now that the wavelength have be calculate it can be use to determine that value of rydberg 's constant each transition emits a discreet wavelength in the visible spectrum a show below in table 2 from the table the value of 𝑛 𝑓 and 𝑛 𝑖 be use a 𝑛 1 and 𝑛 2 from eqn 5 now the value of rydberg 's constant can be calculate use eqn 5 rearrange eqn 5 every observe spectral line have a certain angular spread when observe through the spectrometer this spread can be minimise by narrow the slit of the instrument for most visible line the slit can be kept narrow enough so the error be immeasurable with this apparatus but a you pan farther out the line be blur and can not be view with a narrow slit in these case the angular spread of the line be measure and that be use a a measure of the uncertainty in the measurement of the position of the line the uncertainty in table 1 be these very angular spread since these be measure for the furthest line observe the error be the maximum possible for the precede line also thus this have be accepted a the maximum possible error in each colour in equation 8 m and d be know and so the uncertainty in λ be directly related to the uncertainty in the position the error in the value of rydberg 's constant be simply the error in the inverse wavelength a the value in table 2 be know with certainty thus the error 𝜎 𝜃 be for red 𝜎 𝜃 1'48 `` and violet 𝜎 𝜃 3′ the error calculate for the red spectral line be 46.8 𝑛𝑚 and that for the violet spectral line be 2.1 𝑛𝑚 fri nge order 'm use the value of wavelength 𝑛 𝑖 𝑛 𝑓 and the error calculate a above rydberg 's constant be calculate to be the value of rydberg 's constant obtain from the experiment for red and violet spectral line be 1.061 ± 0.073 x10 7 m −1 and 1.061 ± 0.01 𝑥 10 7 𝑚 −1 respectively although these value do not coincide with the accepted value of rydberg 's constant which be 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 their uncertainty cover this value this uncertainty however may arise from several source both random and systematic one of the main cause of a random error be the overheat of the hydrogen lamp which may alter the data and increase uncertainty the change in pressure of the gas in the discharge tube could also contribute to random error a the gas pressure be increase the spike become broader this 'pressure broadening be a direct consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle and stem from the fact that a the pressure increase the gas molecule undergo more and more collision thus reduce the average time for which a molecule can remain in a give electronic state the heisenberg principle implies that a the lifetime of give state decrease it energy becomes less and less well define the net result be that the characteristic emission wavelength be smeared-out into band 10 the more systematic error however arise mainly from misalignment or wrong calibration of the spectrometer the correct focus of the spectrometer telescope may also add to the error in measure the position of spectral line since the observation of spectral line depends on the light passing through the slit the position of the lamp in front of the slit can add to the uncertainty in position of the line if it be n't place precisely in front of the slit a mention previously the slit of the spectrometer be misalign cause break in the spectral line but a these break in the line be horizontal in nature it do not affect the measurement the above factor when estimate and include in the uncertainty provide a realistic estimate about the officially accepted value of rydberg 's constant the aim of this experiment be to determine the value of rydberg 's constant to a certain degree of precision and accuracy use a grate spectrometer a sodium-vapour lamp for calibration and a hydrogen discharge lamp to observe the spectral line the basic theory behind this experiment be derive from the principle and theory of diffraction atomic spectrum and the basic idea of quantum physic the chance of success be strong with this experiment a it u apparatus with a low margin for error since most of the data analysis be do on python error due to calculation and human error be minimise although there be n't many light must be shone on the few yet significant possibility of error in this experiment since the measure equipment consists of a spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp the main source of error be the relative position of the lamp slit and diffraction grate also since the position of the telescope and centre of the cross wire be do use our naked eye accuracy be very limited there be also the systematic error that arises from the spread of wavelength widen of the spectral line this error however can not be measure a beyond a point the cross wire be too thick to accurately measure the angular width of the spectral line improvement in term of accuracy can be make by use electronic detector instead of our naked eye although our eye be sensitive they be n't sensitive enough to observe the line when the slit be at it narrow position this be prominent when two different observer may detect vary spectral line to vary degree of accuracy perform this experiment help develop skill in take measurement

43,GS_HSB934_Redacted,"he rydberg constant r relates the transition wavelength in hydrogen to the energy level between which the electron transfer this applies to all element not just hydrogen thus we can use it to predict the wavelength emit from any atom through any energy state transmission r can also be use therefore to determine the difference in energy state through which any electron in any atom may transfer give u the value for the energy state in that atom the theory of this behavior be described in more depth in section ii spectroscopy be use to enable the repeat observation of one beam emit from the lamp when set up correctly a spectrometer be capable of make very accurate and repeatable measurement so it be important to set it up very specifically the equipment we use consist of a collimator a diffraction grate and a telescope by passing it through a diffraction grate the light beam be split up meaning multiple order could be analyze to obtain multiple value for the wavelength a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm be employ to achieve this the beam be then pas through a telescope to enable observation far description of the work of the setup can be found in section iii to carry out the experiment we observe the emission of a hydrogen lamp a tube contain low-pressure hydrogen gas after excitation through heating or electrify for example the atom in the gas lose energy in the form of photon a an electron in an atom transfer to a low energy state it emits a photon of energy equal to the difference in energy of the two state in a sample of one element only energy level of specific value exist thus only transition of specific energy can occur the photoelectric effect then result in the production of photon of certain wavelength only spectrum produce by excite gas be observe a have emission at just a few wavelength create an 'emission line spectrum in hydrogen these 'lines be give the name the balmer series 1 in the laboratory we observe just two line of which the wavelength be give by 2 where λ be the wavelength of the light emit and n represent the initial and p the final state of the atom in the balmer series p=2 and n=3,4,5 ... the fact that only line of two different color be observe do not prove n=5 do not exist it be possible other wavelength of non-visible light be emit by the gas or that the atom be not excite enough for the electron to occupy state n=5 far experimentation would be need to confirm this in order to obtain multiple measurement of λ different order of the emission line spectrum be look at figure 1 illustrates how a diffraction grate disperses a beam the order of the beam m can in theory be any integer m and  the angle between the 0 th order and the m th order be related by the equation grate be usually give by the manufacturer in term of n number of line per mm d be easily found by calculate n must be multiply by 10 3 first to find how many line there be per m so that d can be in unit m. in this calculation we assume the thickness of each line be negligible by measure the angle  for several value of m and plot m against sin the gradient of the graph becomes d λ ⁄ after multiplication by d 1 λ ⁄ can be substitute into 1 the light from the hydrogen lamp be first to be pas through a narrow slit follow by a collimate lens to produce a very thin collimate beam and then pas through a diffraction grate the light then be to be collect by a telescope consist of a camera lens and an eyepiece a crosshair x be visible through the telescope eyepiece to help with alignment all measurement be take with the line on the centre of the crosshair figure 2 illustrates the path of the beam through the setup a choice of two grate be available in our laboratory on of 300 line per mm and one of 78.8 line per mm i originally decide to use the grate n=300 because i thought this would result in a small percentage error for d take the error would be 0.05 line per mm however upon look through the eyepiece it be see that there be more visible order with the use of the n=78.8 grate so it be decide that we use this one in order to have the opportunity to obtain the maximum number of measurement so that  could be varied the grate be mount on a rotate grate table or turntable and the telescope which be attach to the turntable could also be rotate the turntable have a vernier scale on it which show the angular position of the turntable and the telescope use this  be measure these property be show in figure 3. the turntable be also utilized to accurately set up the spectroscopy equipment the grate have to be at precisely 90 to the beam achieve this be challenge the vernier scale on the turntable have a resolution of a sixtieth of a degree so tiny movement in the position of the telescope and angle of the table could be make such movement be make roughly and then fine-tuned use fine adjustment screw before the telescope and turntable be clamped into place it be important not to leave the hydrogen lamp on for more than 10 minute so a not to damage it so it be temporarily replace with a sodium lamp whilst position adjustment be make firstly the telescope be position so the source could be see to be align with the crosshair at 0 to the beam it be then rotate through exactly 90 and a mirror insert into the clamp where the grate would later sit this be exactly what be demonstrate in figure 3. the rotate grate table be then adjust until the beam could be see through the eyepiece of the telescope meaning the mirror be at 45 to the beam the turntable could then be rotate through 45 in order for the mirror to be at 90 to the beam at which point it be replace with the diffraction grate the slit space must remain a control variable so the same diffraction grate be use throughout the experiment keep d constant it be difficult to perceive the line through the eyepiece at the begin of the experiment due to background light to try to minimize this problem the main light be turn off in the laboratory with each desk have it own table lamp which be switch off during observation through the eyepiece light from other desk 's experiment still present a problem so a piece of black card with a collimator-shaped hole be cut out and stuck round the collimator with blu-tac this prove very effective in block out background light once set up the equipment be left clamped in position so only the telescope could be move this kept the turntable in a fix positon ensure the grate remain at the same angle to the beam and the 0 th order emission line remain in the same position the source be then switch back to a hydrogen lamp through the eyepiece we observe emission line spectrum of two different color one blue and one red we concentrate on the set separately to find two value for the rydberg constant rb and rr respectively blue be take first the crosshair be line up with the 0 th order line which be identifiable by the fact that it be both red and blue the reading on the vernier at 0 th order 0 be note and then the three repeat reading of m be take one by each of my lab partner and i. this be do in order to spot with a view to remove any personal bias then an average be take to minimize variation in human judgement of the reading the measurement have to be take through a magnify glass a the scale be very small and the light low the range of m be restrict by the lack of accessibility to the eyepiece at large angle and also the time we have in the laboratory it be interest to note at this point that the blue line be separate by less angle than the red which illustrate the proportionality of sin to  a predict in 2 since blue wavelength be shorter than red one after collection of the raw data average of the three repeat reading be take in order to find  for each value of m 0 minus m be calculate after the rearrangement of 2 m be plot against sin for both blue and red light a figure 4 and figure 5 respectively which be show below in python the of the line of best for of both graph be obtain the gradient of the blue light emission graph be found to be 25.642 0.650 and the red 19.1730.097 the gradient of the graph be equal to d λ ⁄ recall 3 d be calculate to be 1.26910 -5 m 0.06 take the error in n to be 0.05 line per mm the gradient of both graph be then divide by d to obtain value for 1 λ ⁄ 1 λ b ⁄ be found to be 2.02110 6 m -1 which be repeatable because this would give a blue wavelength b of 495nm the range of blue light be 450-495nm 3 and this figure be within the range 1 λ r ⁄ be also repeatable since it be calculate to be 1.51110 6 m -1 which give a red wavelength r of 662nm also within the accepted range for red light 620-750nm 3 it be give that the two balmer transition have initial state n=4 and n=3 and final state p=2 2 we can use the idea that the energy of a photon be proportional to the frequency of the photon therefore inversely proportional to it wavelength to decide which color light corresponds to which energy state transition from this we can deduce that the transition from n=4 to p=2 result in the blue emission because this be the large energy state transfer and blue light have the small wavelength by elimination the red light be a result of the transition from n=3 to p=2 these value for p and n be then fill into 1 to obtain r ∞ from observation of blue light rb be found to be 1.07810 7 m -1 and from red rr 1.08810 7 m -1 systematic error be then address the computer calculate uncertainty on the gradient and the percentage error in d be add in quadrature to give b of 0.027m -1 and r of 0.006m -1 the percentage error for rr be small only 0.51 whereas that of rb be almost five time large 2.5 one can see from the position of the data point relative to the line of best fit in figure 4 that this be due to the presence of more variation with blue light which lead to a great uncertainty in the gradient the gradient error at first seem large on paper there should not have be much variation in the experiment because there be not many outside factor which could affect the setup moreover the equipment have a very small resolution the vernier measure to a sixtieth of a degree meaning uncertainty in the take of the reading should have be small however the experiment be conduct in very poor light for reason mention in iii a. which result in difficulty with reading the vernier scale even with the use of a magnify glass we rely on human judgement to deduce where the scale line up exactly from the raw data you can see that my lab partner and i all thought the scale line up at slightly different reading this introduce random error the range of  m be only about 9 so any error in the vernier reading whilst small result in a percentage uncertainty which be large than one would automatically expect furthermore due to the calculation 0 minus m any uncertainty the measurement for  would be double that in also the set up of the spectrometer have to be do very precisely it be possible we do not take sufficient care in do this a result of this could be that the grate be not at exactly 90 to the beam i be not sure how this would affect the scatter of the beam far investigation would be need to confirm if this could have be a source of error there be far error to consider in this experiment one of which be the fact that the line in the observe spectrum have width although we align the center of the crosshair with the line we do not account for the fact that the line have a width result in uncertainty in the position of the line and therefore in m i do not have time in the laboratory to investigate the size and implication of this error so have not include it in b or r but would have do so if i have have more time the rydberg constant have the measure value 10,973,731.6m -1 2 let u compare this with our calculate value for r of 10,780,000m -1 270,000 m -1 and 10,880,000 m -1 270,000 m -1 firstly let u establish if our two figure be concurrent with each other take into account uncertainty the low rr could be be 1.08310 7 m -1 and the high rb could be be 1.10510 7 m -1 the two result be therefore in agreement with each other a they lie within each other 's range the measure value for r also lie within the range we calculate in the laboratory although it only lie within the range of the blue emission line the large rr could be be 1.09310 7 m -1 rr in contrast be closer to the measure value than rb in the laboratory the rydberg constant have be determine to be in the range of 1.05310 7 m -1 to 1.10510 7 m -1 this be concurrent with the measure value of r which be 10,973,731.6m -1 technique involve spectroscopic equipment be employ to obtain this range overall this method work very well once in position the spectroscopy equipment be simple to use and enable u to make precise measurement also there be only three parameter to measure in this experiment  0  m and n. this kept the magnitude of the systematic uncertainty low have we allow more time for the experiment we could have set up the spectrometer to a more exact standard which would have reduce the uncertainty on measurement take from the telescope it would also have be useful to use a vernier scale of large size to enable easy reading and therefore less error due to human judgement if the experiment have be conduct in a separate room the main light could have be switch on for the reading of the vernier again make the scale easy to read and reduce the error use a desk that be not situate adjacent to a wall therefore allow access to all angle of the telescope would have enable u to analyze more order of the emission line spectrum give u a figure for r closer to the true value alternatively a diffraction grate of small n could have be use cause the order to have small angle between them therefore more order would be see in the angle range permit by our setup and more value of m analyze",superficial,bal

45,GS_HBQ145_Redacted,in this experiment we use a grate spectrometer to observe the emission line spectrum of a hydrogen lamp in order to calculate the rydberg constant the spectral line we observe be part of the balmer series and the diffraction angle for order 0 to 3 for the colour blue green and red be measure the sine of the angle that the emission line occur at be plot a a function of the

× 10 7 the accepted value be ∼ 1.097373 × 10 7 the percentage error be ≈ 1 however the accepted value lie outside our uncertainty the small uncertainty obtain be due to the small error in the diffraction angle 10 arcminute and negligible error in the diffraction grate space t he hydrogen lamp that we will be use be a thin discharge tube that contains gaseous hydrogen at low temperature apply a high potential difference across the tube excites electron of the hydrogen atom 1 so that they be elevate to a high energy state when the electron transition back down to a quantise level of low energy a photon be emit the energy of the photon be equal to the energy difference between the level transition 2 the hydrogen atom in our discharge tube will be emit visible light and we will be use a diffraction grate to split up the light into it constituent wavelength the result series of spectral line be part of the balmer series 3 and be described by the rydberg formula see theory equation 1 when electron transition from quantise energy level n 3 4 5 ... to the energy level of principal quantum number n 2 4 we be observe the balmer line rather than other line from other hydrogen spectral series because the balmer line lie in the visible part of the spectrum in this experiment we will first use the grate spectrometer to measure the angle of diffraction that the colour blue green and red undergo in order to calculate their wavelength use the grate equation 5 from this a value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h can be obtain a it be know what transition be make by an electron in the hydrogen atom to emit each wavelength of light we be analyse study of the balmer series and therefore use of the rydberg constant have it application due to the abundance of hydrogen in the universe an example be in astronomy particularly in the classification of star base on their surface temperature the strength or weakness of spectral line like those in the balmer series can indicate temperature 6 we be calculate the rydberg constant because of it important role in the rydberg formula which describes the wavelength of light emit when an electron transition from a high energy energy shell to a low energy shell within the atom this formula be of great importance due to it application and due to it contribution to the development and evolution of the atomic model chemical element can only absorb and emit photon with quantise wavelength for many chemical element these wavelength be described by the rydberg formula where λ b be the wavelength of the emit light r ∞ be the rydberg constant and n i and n f be the energy level or principal quantum number of the orbitals occupy by the electron before and after it transition respectively for our hydrogen discharge lamp the result series of spectral line be call the balmer series 7 the balmer line be the result of the follow process firstly an electron in the hydrogen atom absorbs energy in this case supply from the apply voltage across the tube and accord to the bohr model of the atom the energy absorbed by an electron to transition to a high energy level in this experiment to n 3 4 or 5 must be a multiple of an amount of energy equal to hcr ∞ where h be plank 's constant and c be the speed of light in vacuo 2 and can not be any amount of energy secondly once the electron have absorbed a quantum of sufficient energy it then transition or `` quantum leap `` to a high more unstable orbital n i this be follow by a spontaneous transition to the more stable orbital of principal quantum number n f 2 emit energy equal to the difference in energy between the two energy level in the form of a photon 8 the process of an electron transition from an excite state to a low energy state and in the process emit a photon be call spontaneous emission other series can be obtain such a the lyman series n f 1 or the paschen series n f 3 2 set n f 2 the rydberg equation becomes the balmer formula and the constant becomes r h the rydberg constant for hydrogen it can be show that the rydberg constant for hydrogen can be express in term of other more fundamental constant electron charge e the mass of an electron m e permittivity of free space 0 plank 's constant h and the speed of light in vacuo c in the follow equation see appendix a for derivation the result value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen be 10973731.6m −1 5 for the emission of a photon of blue light the principal quantum number of an electron in the excite state be n i 5. for green n i 4 and for red n i 3. we will determine with a grate spectrometer and use of the grate equation see equation 3 the wavelength of the aforementioned colour in the grate spectrometer set-up light from the hydrogen lamp first pas through a slit to make a point source of light the collimator lens make the light ray parallel so it can then be diffract through a grate the wave energy spread out behind the grate because the slit space d be comparable in size to the wavelength of visible light d 78.8 line per mm the wave that spread out interfere and the result be spectral line the zeroth order spectral line occur at a diffraction angle of zero degree the high the order spectral line the great the angle the light have be diffract through a telescope be move to locate the various order and focus the spectral line to make a measurement of the diffraction angle θ. if the difference in path to a point some distance away much great than d between two slit be an integer number m of wavelength λ the two wave will meet at that point in phase result in a maximum a region of constructive interference see in figure 1 9 the difference in path be also equal to d sin θ the constituent colour have different wavelength so each correspond maximum for each colour have a different diffraction angle fig 2 show the expect intensity of light from a discharge tube akin to the hydrogen lamp we be use a a function of the diffraction angle if only 4 slit be illuminate the large peak be principal maximum and the small peak be secondary maximum since the intensity of secondary maximum be much less than principal maximum distinct spectral line be resolve 5 the position of spectral line occur at angle of 2πm be m be call the order number and be an integer before measurement of the diffraction angle can be make the diffraction grate must be align with the collimator first the eyepiece be focus on the cross-hair to eliminate any eye-strain when view through it the camera lens be focus use the focus knob see fig 3 7 on a distant object so that the telescope be set up to receive parallel light since light passing through the collimator in the spectrometer will be become parallel a sharp image of the entrance slit attach to the collimator when view through the telescope be achieve by adjust the collimator focus and slit size such that an image of a thin slit be form at the cross-hair when the telescope be in line with the collimator the telescope be then move through precisely 90 • use the vernier scale so that it be perpendicular to the axis of the collimator and clamped in position use the telescope rotation lock screw a diffraction grate with slit space 78.8 line per mm be insert into the mount with ruling vertical like the entrance slit so that the order produce by the diffraction be horizontally align and therefore can be view with the telescope the entrance slit be then illuminate with a sodium lamp instead of hydrogen lamp because the hydrogen lamp can overheat and cease to emit light if left on for extend period of time and the grate and mount be then rotate by the spectrometer table until it reflect light from the collimator into the telescope 10 the slit image be then centre with the cross-hair and fine adjustment knob since the telescope and collimator be at 90 • the diffraction grate be therefore 45 • to the collimator and telescope the diffraction grate be then rotate precisely through 45 • use the vernier scale so that the plane of the diffraction grate be perpendicular to light from the collimator when switch on the hydrogen lamp with a potential difference of ∼ 5000v across it the prominent colour we could observe up to the 3 rd order be blue green and red background light from lamp in the room limited the number or order we could see a high order above 3 become too faint the diffraction angle θ be measure for order 0 to 3 by move the telescope so that the centre of the cross-hair reside on each appropriate spectral line the vernier scale on the spectrometer be accurate to 1 arc minute 7 show from above the way in which the telescope can be position to find the spectral line so that diffraction angle can be measure when the angle between the normal to the grate and the telescope be 0 • our vernier scale read 209 • and 29 arcminute we first record all the angle then subtract them from 209 • and 29 arcminute to correct for the systematic error the sine of the diffraction angle θ in radian be plot a a function of the order number m. the gradient be equal to sin θ/m and be equal to wavelength of the light divide by the slit space λ/d obtain by re-arranging the grate equation equation 3 the gradient multiply by the slit space d be equal to the wavelength of the observe balmer series colour λ b and the principal quantum number n i of the electron before the spontaneous emission be 5 4 and 3 for blue green and red respectively the value for r h be hence calculate for each wavelength by use equation 1. spectral line have some thickness and be not infinitely sharp therefore there be an uncertainty associate with the diffraction angle spectral line have this thickness because the atom emit the light be move relative to the observer and the energy level can not be define to exceedingly high or infinite precision due to heisenberg 's uncertainty principle see appendix b 13 the angle be measure to the left and right of the first order blue spectral line we measure this angle to be 10 arcminute the error in 1 d be assume to be negligible and the error in the diffraction angle be assume to be fix at 10 arcminute the error in the gradient be calculate by find the first entry in the covariance matrix for the data for each colour this be do in the computer program language python figure 5 -7 show the plot for each colour observe in the hydrogen balmer series use the correct angle where a reading of 209 • and 29 arcminute corresponds to 0 • between the normal to the diffraction grate and telescope the vertical error bar be very small for each plot a the spectral line be thin result in a small error in the diffraction angle another factor that contribute to small vertical error bar be the high accuracy of the vernier scale to the near 1 arcminute the plot for blue light result in the great error for r h an order of magnitude great than for green and red see table i a source of random error enter the experiment a the mark of the vernier scale be difficult to see and sometimes there be ambiguity a to which of the mark line up indicate the minute of arc the ambiguity if there be any be always with neighbour mark i estimate this error in diffraction angle to be 2 arcminute a the uncertainty be never more than two division to the left or to the right of the mark we chose to be line up add this to the uncertainty due to the assume thickness of the spectral line 10 arcminute the result error be 12 arcminute in the diffraction angle however because 2 arcminute be quite a small error in comparison to 10 arcminute the error in the gradient and error bar have not change noticeably when introduce an improve way of accounting for this random error which by definition change for each measurement be to note down after each reading which mark could also be line up then the angle record would be the mean of the angle half-way between the small and great angle because the ambiguity exist between neighbour mark and the uncertainty would be half the difference between the great and small potential diffraction angle there be no horizontal error bar because the principal maximum be discrete and countable table i below display the result use the gradient of figure 5 -7 and equation 3 to calculate the wavelength λ b table i also show the value of r h calculate use the rydberg formula equation 1 set n f 2 for each colour the error be denote by σ with a subscript to denote the quantity that the error be associate with and superscript with the colour it be associate with for example σ blue r h be the error in the value r h that be calculate with blue light the percentage error in the calculate value of r h for blue the error in our mean value for r h constitutes a possible variation in the mean of less than 1 ≈0.87 this error be small because the error in the diffraction angle measure be very small 12 arcminute include the estimate random error which be assume to be fix but may have change and no other error be consider a the error in the line per mm of the diffraction grate be assume to be negligible the percentage error in the mean r h be 1.42 however the accepted theoretical value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen lie outside our uncertainty a possible source of systematic error that may have contribute to the overall increase in our value for the mean r h may include incorrect calibration when align the diffraction grate this be unlikely to be the main source of error because the value for r h when use blue light be less than the accepted value this mean the primary source of error be likely to be random error the aim of the experiment be to calculate rydberg constant for hydrogen by take measurement of the hydrogen balmer series use a grate spectrometer to do this light from a hydrogen lamp be make parallel and pas through a diffraction grate each colour in the balmer series blue green and red diffract by different angle which be measure and the sine of the angle be plot a a function of the order of the spectral line we then calculate three value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each colour use the gradient of the plot our mean value for r h be 1.113000×10 7 ± 2.342×10 4 the mean differs by ≈ 1 of the actual accepted value 109737321.568508 which lie outside our uncertainty an improvement to our experiment would be to measure the diffraction angle to high order which would reduce the error in the gradient in order to achieve this we would have to perform the experiment in a darker room with no lamp so that high order for all colour be make visible a poor assumption be also make that the error in the diffraction angle be fix however an improvement would be to measure the thickness of each of the spectral line another improvement would be to measure diffraction angle spectral order go in the negative direction this would enable u to calculate more value for r h thus reduce the effect of random error appendix a derivation of the rydberg formula 13 14 use niels bohr 's picture of the atom we consider an electron orbit a proton where the centripetal and coulomb force equate the quantity r be the

slit a sodium lamp be use in setup rather than a hydrogen lamp a the latter would overheat after short period of time and switch off the focus of the collimator be then adjust so that an image of the slit be align with the cross wire this be complete without adjust the camera focus the demonstrator recommend rotate the cross wire to form a × rather than a a this meant that slit be easily visible the slow-motion drive and clamp screw be tune and final adjustment be make to the camera and collimator the telescope be rotate 90 degree and clamped into position a 300-slit grate be place into the holder and a ruler be use to ensure it be vertical the grate table be rotate until the diffraction grate be at a 45-degree angle from the incident light ray an initial observation of the position of the slit 's reflect image in the telescope be make and the height of the image be alter via the adjustment screw beneath the grate table reading on both scale the main scale which be graduate in degree and the secondary scale which be graduate in arcminute be take and the grate be then move through 45 degree ensure that the eyepiece be situate at 0 degree to the incident light ray the telescope be reposition temporarily so approximate position of the spectral line could be note the telescope be then revolve so that diffract image of the slit could be observe for different order e.g -2 -1 0 1 2. the error record on the result for the setup of the sodium lamp be 0.5 degree and 1 arcminute these value be base on the scale 's precision the error also consider difference between experimenter 1 's and experimenter 2 's reading table 1 illustrates the initial measurement make when set up the sodium lamp the preliminary result for the setup of the experiment show in table i be not usable a the eyepiece be not focus on the same maximum this meant that the reference angle be not suitable for take result the uncertainty in the preliminary and final result be close to negligible a the percentage uncertainty be in the magnitude of 1 × 10 −3 for both the preliminary and final result a sodium lamp be substitute for a hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be switch off when not in use to prevent overheat final adjustment be make to the slit size before measurement be take to ensure optimum intensity and resolution preliminary result be then record for each transition wavelength θ be measure against both positive and negative order some data value in the table have be replace by n/a which signifies that the reference angle for that order could not be obtain this be primarily due to light pollution from other lamp meaning that it be difficult to identify fringe line a the order m increase from -2 to 2 the reference angle decrease equation ii.2 implies that if sin θ be plot against the order m it will produce a linear relationship table iv the data for the reference angle be an average of the two-data set produce by the experimenter the result be take between order -2 and 2 where the range of the angle for red be from 168.42º to 215.03º the range for blue be from 176.94º to 207.12º and the range for purple be from 175.06º to 208.09º the final measurement follow the same general relationship a the preliminary measurement however the decrease in the reference angle becomes more consistent diminish by approximately 12º for red 8º for blue and 8º for purple whereas in the preliminary investigation the reference angle decrease by vary amount the main source of uncertainty with the result be due to parallax error an attempt to resolve this be make by take reading when level with the scale another source of error be due to the thickness of the fringe consequently all measurement be take in the centre of the fringe random error arose a it be difficult to see the cross in the dark and so the fringe be not consistently align this be resolve by periodically turn on the lamp to check alignment other potential source of systematic error be air pressure humidity and occasional defocus of the telescope both air pressure and humidity remain roughly constant during the investigation hence it be unnecessary to account for these variable moreover the defocus of the telescope be temporary and so be not problematic a with the error in the setup of the sodium lamp the percentage uncertainty in the reference angle be very small in the order of 1 × 10 −3 the percentage error in the gradient be very small in the order of 1 × 10 −2 for red and 1 × 10 −3 for purple this be due to the small y error bar and the lack of anomalous point in figure i. however the error in the y-intercept be very large a the percentage error have a magnitude of 1 × 10 2 this be a the y-intercept be small whilst the absolute error have remain roughly constant however the percentage error in the yintercept be unimportant a it be not use in calculate the rydberg constant a 300-slit grate be use so d be equal to 3.33 × 10 −6 m. use equation ii.8 the value of d and the gradient the calculate rydberg constant be 10989388.37m −1 the error in this number can be calculate by use the equation where σ x be the error in the gradient of red 0.003. this produce a figure of 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 see algebraic manipulation for both value in lab book the primary aim of the investigation be to measure the spectrum of hydrogen and to obtain an accurate value for the rydberg constant the secondary aim be to obtain an error of magnitude of less than 1 × 10 −3 the method involve make observation of the spectral line through the telescope the value of the reference angle on both the main and secondary scale be note a graph be produce of sin θ against order m and a gradient be determine from this the rydberg constant be obtain the success of the investigation be determine a value of the rydberg constant within one thousandth of the accepted value and produce a graph with no observable anomaly and a percentage error less than one percent the main failure of the experiment be produce an error of magnitude 1 × 10 −2 which come into conflict with the secondary aim the key achievement of the experiment be obtain a strong positive correlation for the linear plot for figure i and produce strong data analysis consist of error in both the gradient and y-intercept one improvement to the experimental method would be monitoring the environmental factor such a

final state of the atom respectively when an atom gain energy the electron move from a low energy level to a high one during excitation this excite state be not stable and the electron drop from a high energy level to a low one result in the emission of a photon whose energy be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial state of the atom therefore the colour of the light emit can be determine by calculate the frequency of the photon emit use formula 2 hence the balmer series in hydrogen can be give by equation 5 with 𝑝 2 and 𝑛 3,4,5….the idea of bohr 's model of the atom be involve when the atom drop from the nth energy level to the second result in photon emission with specific wavelength depend on n. use equation 5 the wavelength value can be calculate and through the use of the standard colour spectrum chart the colour of the light emit can be deduce an example of a balmer series transition be show in figure 1. the main aim of the experiment carry out be to measure the hydrogen spectrum and use the data obtain to determine the rydberg constant which represent the wavenumber of the photon with the least energy that cause the ionisation of the hydrogen

primary aim be to take measurement of the diffraction angle at each order number for the red and blue hydrogen spectral line and determine the average diffraction angle for each order number in order to determine the value of wavelength 𝜆 a straight line graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 have to be drawn whose gradient would be equal to 𝜆 𝑑 therefore enable u to calculate λ. the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 at each diffraction order have to be determine by subtract the average diffraction angle at each specific order 𝜃 by the average angle at zeroth order 𝜃 0 and then take the sine of the difference between the two angle finally use formula 5 the rydberg constant for each spectral line could be determine the diffraction angle be measure use the vernier scale that read at sixtieth of a degree there be a risk of random error appear when use the vernier scale due to parallax error through the use of the magnify glass the effect of parallax error be minimise the angle at zeroth order be determine for the red and blue spectral line the diffraction angle measurement be repeat three time at each order number and the average be take so that the reliability of our measurement could be enhance and so that random error could be encounter possible source of systematic error be humidity and background light permittivity of free space varies with humidity therefore this affect our value of the rydberg constant because the rydberg constant a show by formula 3 and 4 depends on the value of the permittivity of free space therefore systematic error be introduce in the experiment background light make our eye less sensitive therefore we can not see well hence we could end up miss line for the effect of background light on our measurement to be minimise a black card be take a hole be punch in it and the card be then stuck around the collimator another method we use to minimise the effect of background light be to cover the apparatus with a black cloth because it prevent the external light from go into the collimator and show up on the image after determine the average diffraction angle in each order number the follow formula have to be use to determine the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 which be the y-coordinates for plot the sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 graph y-coordinate 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 9 where 𝜃 be the average diffraction angle at a specific order number and 𝜃 0 be the average

zeroth order and then the sine of the difference between the angle be take after determine the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 for each order number a straight line graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 be drawn use python with gradient equal to 𝜆 𝑑 both the slope of the straight line for the two spectral line together with their associate uncertainty be determine use python thereby enable u to determine the wavelength 𝜆. use formula 5 the rydberg constant for the red and blue spectral line be deduce to calculate the rydberg constant use formula 5 for the two spectral line the balmer series transition be consider therefore use n=2 and p=5 for the calculation of the rydberg constant of the blue spectral line and n=2 p=3 for the rydberg constant determination of the red spectral line a sample calculation for the determination of the wavelength of the red spectral line be show 𝜆 𝑑𝑔 𝜆 6.62 × 10 −7 𝑚 where 𝑔 be the slope of the graph equal to 5.22× 10 −2 ± 1.20 × 10 −3 and 𝑑 be the

straight line of best fit for the blue spectral line be 3.89× 10 −2 ± 3.40 × 10 −3 where again both the slope together with it associate uncertainty be determine use python therefore λ for the blue spectral line be found to be 4.94× 10 −7 𝑚 and the calculate value of the rydberg constant be deduce a 0.965× 10 7 𝑚 −1 a representation of the data obtain for the blue and red spectral line be show by figure 3 the uncertainty in our 𝜃 value be determine use python to calculate the standard error of the mean for each average 𝜃 value at each order number for each spectral line before calculate the standard error of the mean the standard deviation have to be calculate use the follow equation the sample standard deviation 𝑆 be define by where 𝑁 be the sample size equal to 3 in our experiment since we repeat our diffraction angle measurement 3 time for each order number 𝑥̅ be the sample mean in our case the average diffraction angle in each order number 𝑥 𝑖 represent each of the value of the data in our case the diffraction angle in each order number use the standard deviation to estimate the uncertainty of each diffraction angle measure use the vernier scale the standard error of the

calculate use python 𝑁 be the sample size equal to 3 in our case since diffraction angle measurement for each order number be repeat three time when the uncertainty in our average diffraction angle value at each order number for each spectral line be determine the uncertainty in our sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 value could be determine by calculate the difference between the maximum and the minimum value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 and then divide the result by 2. this enable u to plot the vertical error bar represent the uncertainty in sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 in python the uncertainty 𝜎 𝑦 in sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 can be calculate use where 𝜃 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 be the maximum and minimum average diffraction angle respectively and 𝜃 0 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝜃 0 𝑚𝑖𝑛 be the maximum and minimum average angle at zeroth order for each spectral line the maximum and minimum average diffraction angle at each order number be determine use the standard error of the mean of those angle which be equal to the uncertainty in those angle the calculation be carry out in python use the uncertainty in the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 the vertical error bar in the graph of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against m correspond to those uncertainty be plot in python a show in figure 3. this enable u use python to determine the uncertainty in the slope of each straight line so that it could be use to determine the overall uncertainty of the rydberg constant value of the red and blue spectral line in this experiment the 78.8 ± 0.1 line per mm grate be chosen instead of the 100,200 and 300 line per mm grate since although the narrower the slit the great the resolution of the line the line become much dimmer a the slit be close therefore to balance out these two consideration the 78.8 ± 0.1 line per mm grate be the most appropriate in this experiment enable u to take more measurement of the diffraction angle hence increase the reliability of our result by encounter random error the number of line per unit length of our slit in the begin be suppose to be 80 line per mm but they be 78.8 ± 0.1 line per mm because it use an old definition of 2001 line per inch which be in imperial unit the 2001 line per inch approximate to 78.8 line per mm to calculate the uncertainty in 𝑑 𝜎 𝑑 the follow method be use where 𝑛 78.9 and 𝑛 78.8 be the number of line 78.9 and 78.8 line respectively the uncertainty in 𝑑 be found to be 1.61× 10 −8 m therefore our value of 𝑑 could be state a 1.27× 10 −5 m± 1.61 × 10 −8 m. to determine the uncertainty in the be determine by where 𝜎 𝑑 be the uncertainty in the slit separation value 𝑑 be the slit separation value 𝜎 𝑔 be the uncertainty in the slope of the straight line of best fit of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 and 𝑔 be the slope of this straight line it be possible to use quadrature to calculate the uncertainty in when the rydberg constant of the red and blue spectral line together with their correspond uncertainty be determine then the overall rydberg constant value could be calculate together with it uncertainty this can be do by calculate the weight average of the rydberg constant of the two spectral line and then find the uncertainty on the weight average the follow formula be use to calculate the weight average the weight average value of the rydberg constant of the two line 𝑅 ∞ 𝑎𝑣𝑒 be define by where 𝑅 ∞ 𝑟𝑒𝑑 be the rydberg constant of the red spectral line and 𝜎 𝑅∞ 𝑟𝑒𝑑 it associate uncertainty.𝑅 ∞ 𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒 be the rydberg constant of the blue spectral line and 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ 𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒 be it uncertainty to determine the uncertainty in the overall value of the rydberg constant deduce from the weight average of the rydberg constant of the two spectral line 𝜎 𝑅∞ 𝑎𝑣𝑒 the follow equation be use where 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ 𝑟𝑒𝑑 be the uncertainty in the rydberg constant of the red spectral line and 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ 𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒 be the uncertainty in the rydberg constant of the blue spectral line the overall value of the rydberg constant determine in the experiment use formula 16 and formula 17 be 1.077 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 2.400 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 by observe the spectral line of hydrogen the value of the rydberg constant we obtain for the blue and red spectral line be 0.965 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 8.44 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 and 1.087 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 2.500 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 respectively the overall value of the rydberg constant determine from the weight average of the rydberg constant of the two spectral line be 1.077 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 2.400 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 it uncertainty brings the measurement into the range cover the true value of rydberg constant of 1.097 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 6.500 × 10 −6 𝑚 −1 show that our measure value be compatible there could have be improvement on the method carry out to determine the rydberg constant even though we repeat our diffraction angle measurement 3 time for each order number use the vernier scale to take measurement we could have repeat the angle measurement more time to encounter random error and make result more reliable the use of the magnify glass while take the diffraction angle measurement reduce the effect of parallax error therefore make our measurement more accurate during the experiment we try to reduce the effect of background light either by cover the apparatus use a black cloth or punch a hole in the middle of a black card and stick it around the collimator so that external light be prevent from enter the collimator and show up on the image background light could have be a source of systematic error by make our eye less sensitive make u not see properly and we could have widen the slit reduce uncertainty if i repeat the experiment i would take into account humidity and try to determine how much it affect our rydberg constant value because it varies with the value of the permittivity of free space that be include in the rydberg constant equation thereby introduce systematic error by affect the rydberg constant value by use the level i would ensure that the diffraction grate holder be level in all direction i would reduce any misalignment and use a sharper telescope in conclusion our overall value of the rydberg constant be

technique and instmments use to experimentally measure the rydberg constant be fundamental in modem science spectrometry especially have a wide range of u range from large scale astronomy 2 to the characte1ization of protein 3 in this experiment we use a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp to view the balmer series the balmer series be the emission spectrum of hydrogen that result when an electron within a hydrogen atom drop down to the energy level n=2 4 use the balmer series of hydrogen be useful a the emission spectrum consists of easily distinguishable colour line of visible light call balmer line the wavelength of this emit light be call the transition wavelength by measure the angular displacement of various emission line from a central maximum we be able to calculate the transition wavelength for hydrogen with far calculation and the use of some reference data we calcultated rx we measure the angular displacement of emission line from a central maximum in the hydrogen emission spectnun this be do use a spectrometer fig 1 show a diagram of the spectrometer use far detail of the individual component be described in section 3. when light be shone tlu•ough the grate it be diffract by different amount depend on it wavelength a show in fig 2. a the grate be make up of many naitows slit the light that pas through each slit interferes with light from all the other slit this lead to mostly destmctive inte1ference however when the path difference between ray of the same colour light be an integer multiple m of 21t the light interferes constmctively to give a maximum

discrete energy level n define in the bohr model have integer value assign to them the most central energy level closest to the nucleus be numbered 1 with the n increase by one for each energy level situate futiher from the nucleus the nucleus of an atom have a positive charge and an electron have a negative charge therefore a an electron move fu1ther from the nucleus and up energy level it gain potential energy when an energy-rich electron transition from a high energy level to a low energy level it conserve energy by emit a photon fonned from the potential energy it no longer need in the case of the balmer series when and electron fall from an energy level n 2 to the energy level n=2 the photon emit often take the form of visible light after calculate a use 1 we can calculate r .. use

dete1mined use a colour spectnun cha1t set up the spectrometer and thus the experiment be a multistep process a prima1y task in this process be to ensure good focus in all the individual component to allow for good data collection we first focus the eyepiece on the crosshair next we point the telescope at a window and focus the camera on a building across the street the combination of the camera and the eyepiece lens creates an ideal telescope with the camera a the objective lens this telescope be mount on a rotatable platfo1m focus the camera at this distant arbitra1y point ensure that any object closer than this point would also be crisp and clear a any image would be fo1med at the focal point of the objective lens we decrease parallax e1rnr in our image by approach the telescope multiple time from different standpoint and check for parallax each time the rest of the setup be conduct with the aid of a sodium lamp in a darken room a hydrogen lamp overheats roughly fifteen minute after be tumed on a such we use it a minimal amount prior to collect data we focus the collimator to produce a sharp image of the sodium lamp that be roughly centre on the crosshair we then take a note of the reading from the vernier scale that measure the angular displacement of the telescope a it rotate around the grate table due to the darken condition in the room and the small size of the mark on the vemier scale we estimate a systematic e1rnr of± 0.03° in our reading of the scale another key factor of the spectrometer set up be to ensure that the diffraction grate be perfectly in line with the collimator so a to reduce eitor if the diffraction grate be even slightly misalign it would cause systematic e1rnr in our final result after take a reading on the vemier scale we rotate the telescope through precisely 90° and place a diffraction grate in the holder locate between the camera and collimater on the grate table we then rotate the grate table whilst look through the eyepiece until we saw a reflect image of the entrance slit there be partial diffraction of the light cause secondaiy maximum around the main reflection however the main reflection could be easily identify a the brightest band once the eyepiece be centre on the reflection we adjust the grate table to make the diffraction grate exactly ve1ticle this be difficult do do precisely due to the time constraint of the experiment use the vernier scale reading we rotate the grate table round precisely 45° so that the diffraction grate be in line with the collimator we then rotate the diffraction grate in the plane of it surface to create an image at a height sutiable for view through the eyepiece finally after lock the grate table in position we replace the sodium lamp with a hydrogen lamp in this experiment we measure the angular displacement of hydrogen emission line from a central maximum we use a diffraction grate with 300 line per millimetre a this give more intense nattower fringe and increase the number of emission line visible this diffraction grate diffract light more than the other available grate 78.8 line per millimetre a the slit size be closer to the wavelength of light when look through the eyepiece be three different colour visible line a show in fig 4. theoretically there be 4 balmer line in the visible spectmm however due to the amount of background light of the room we be unable to see the fourth we position the lamp a close to the spectrometer slit a possible to allow for maximum intensity of the emission line we close the slit to allow enough light through to see the emission line but ensure that the width of the slit be minimal we then rotate the telescope to position the crosshair on the first red maximum whilst ensure the telescope do n't deviate from this position we note the reading on the vemier scale we then repeat this process for all of the red maximum with order number between -5 and 5. there be more maximum visible outside of this range however they be dim and difficult to exactly position also the necessary angular displacement of the telescope for these far point be difficult to achieve in the anticlockwise direction due to the spatial contrainsts of the desk after record result for the red maximum we repeat the process for both the tm•quoise and purple a the purple line be often difficult to detect we open the slit to produce a wider more visible band of light this lead to an estimate ettor on our reading for purple light of± 0.05° a we be unable to accurately position the crosshair on the centre of the colour band we take multiple reading of angular displacement for eve1y emission line to reduce random ettor use the data collect in section 4 we plot a graph of order number against the sine of the angular displacement sine a show in fig 5. a the vemier scale give a value in degree and arc minute when calculate sine we have to conve1t arc minute into degree when inputting data for our graph we take the modulus of our negative value and combine them with the positive value to create few but large data set for each order number we be able to do this a the displacement of each maximum on the right-hand side of the central maximum be equal and opposite to that of those on the left-hand side combine the value produce a more accurate ettor estimation for the individual point plot and thus the decrease overall e1rnr on the gradient use equation 1 we use the gradient of each of the colour line in fig 5 multiply by the slit space to calculate a. these wavelength along with the accepted wavelength for the balmer emission series and original energy level of the electron that cause the emission 4 be show in table 1. show wavelength of light entitted in the balmer series the data for the universally accepted wavelength and the 'initial energy level column be take from previous scientific research on the balmer series 4 our ettor calculation combine many factor include misread of the vernier scale and misalignment of the cross hair on some bright band we take multiple data set and calculate an e1rnr on the mean of these result 0ul final quantize source of e1rnr be due to the diffraction grate not be perfectly nonnal to the incident light beam this cause systematic ettor a our• data be take over two session we be able to make an estimate of the ettor this cause the spectrometer be set up use the same method for both session however by examine raw data we identify a mean discrepancy of0.18° between the data take in session 1 and the data take in session 2. the calculate value for red be inconsistent with the universally accepted wavelength within the margin of e1rnr calculate there be many element of the experiment that retrospectively could have cause ettor in our collection of data and that may explain our value for the wavelength for red not be coherent with the accepted value the systematic ettor estimate due to the grate misalignment may be an underestimate if the grate be misalign by vary degree of angular displacement in the same direction great error would be present than that calculate to reduce this error we would have to take more measurement after carefully set up the spectrometer multiple time and take a mean of the result another cause of systematic error would be if the central maximum be not zeroed correctly this would be due to the misread of the vernier scale a discus in section 3. this would cause the value for the maximum displacement on the left and right-hand side of the central maximum to not be equal and opposite although there be some discrepancy in result either side of the central maximum we deem this discrepancy to be a result of random error and a such the systematic effect to be negligible random error across the experiment could be reduce by take more data the time constraint of the experiment only allow for the collection of three full data set ideally we would have many more once we have calculate l we use it along with the value for n show in fig 6 to calculate r ¥ for each colour use 2 the mean of these result produce a final value for r ¥ of 10887000 ± 74000 m -1 the scientifically accepted value for r ¥ be 10973731.6 m -1 this discrepancy with the accepted value for r ¥ be a direct result of the inaccuracy of our value for the transition wavelength our aim for this experiment be to calculate r ¥ with a high degree of precision and accuracy with a low uncertainty of just one or two part per thousand with careful use of a grate spectrometer this should have be achievable due to time constraint and lack of experience use the equipment we do not achieve this our final result be 10887000 ± 74000 m -1 whilst this value be close to the accepted value it be still not accurate within the range of our calculate error there be many different data that contribute to our final result each with it own uncertainty a such minimize error on individual measurement be a primary concern the necessity to minimize all individual error and precisely set up equipment be clear however occasionally this necessity be partially disregard due to time constraint a we take a lot of time focus the lens we have minimal time align the diffraction grate i conclude that this grate misalignment be the large source of error in the experiment although it be numerically estimate to be a relatively small value technique to reduce this error include a more precise set up and multiple repetition of the set-up should be implement with far experience and well time management this would be achievable our precision and accuracy could be increase and uncertainty decrease by take more repeat measurement for our data again this be achievable with improve time management we could also improve accuracy by use technology to prevent human error such a misread of the vernier scale a computer sensor to measure angular displacement would have be much more accurate than the human eye in a darken

50,GS_GYI981_Redacted,constant for all wavelength be relatively small around 2 for each meaning the result be reliable the linear relationship between the sine of the diffraction angle and order be prove graphically for all of the colour of light produce by hydrogen so the method be successful in prove the theory need to calculate the wavelength of the diffract light to improve the experiment i would have carry out the method in a darken isolated room where only one experiment be occur at a time ensure that there be a little external source of light a possible this would have be beneficial a with external source light it be difficult to see the spectral line produce by the diffraction grate and therefore it be a challenge to align the crosshair onto the centre of the spectral line by do this the uncertainty in the alignment would have decrease and consequently the overall uncertainty in the calculate value for the rydberg constant would have be small increase the reliability of the result another way to improve the experiment would be to take repeat reading of the angle of diffraction by for example both my lab partner and i take a reading of the scale for each spectral line this way a mean value could be calculate a well a the uncertainty in the angle this experiment have verify that the experimental set-up be capable of measure to a high accuracy by use data take from the set-up to calculate a know value to an acceptable degree of accuracy with small uncertainty within which the know accepted value lie,extended,bal
51,GS_DHM538_Redacted,"1 2 to determine the wavelength of light emit from a hydrogen atom when an electron change energy level the rydberg formula be use within this formula there be a scale constant know a the rydberg constant measure to be 10,973,731.57m -1 1 when the electron be excite and drop to the energy level n=2 it produce a visible spectrum call the balmer series by splitting the light from a hydrogen lamp use a grate spectrometer we be able to see these discrete line of the balmer series and measure the angle of diffraction for multiple order so that the wavelength of each of these line could be determine from these obtain value we be able to calculate the rydberg constant for each wavelength for red aqua and violet wavelength respectively the rydberg constant be found to be 1.0963±0.002745 x10 7 m -1 1.0956±0.004296 x10 7 m -1 and 1.0939±0.002558 x10 7 m -1 all of these value be within a percentage difference from the actual value of rydberg constant by ±0.3149 n 1885 johann balmer first hypothesize a formula that predict and agree with the wavelength for the visible spectral line of a hydrogen atom the balmer series only 3 year later johannes rydberg present another formula very similar to that of balmer although it predict the wavelength of any energy level transition in the hydrogen atom in this formula the rydberg constant be first introduce now over 100 year later the rydberg constant be one of the most accurately define physical constant 1 in the whole of physic demonstrate the importance of this value and how far we 've come in our understand of the physical universe for this experiment the aim be to determine the rydberg constant by observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen through a grate spectrometer observe the discrete visible spectral line through a diffraction grate we be able to measure the angle of diffraction and order for each visible wavelength in the balmer series of hydrogen use the spectrometer by take multiple reading of order and angle of diffraction a graph sin v m can be plot use equation 5 and therefore the wavelength determine for each colour of the emission spectrum each colour corresponds to a different energy level transition in the balmer series and a a result the rydberg constant can be calculate for each of these wavelength use 2 where p will be different for each of the wavelength the rydberg constant calculate for these different wavelength should in theory be exactly the same however in practice they will only be approximately the same due to the error in measurement of the angle a well a random error occur in the set up and collection of data for the experiment the measurement will be take use a spectrometer which have an accuracy to ±0.5 arcminute which be extremely accurate however the actual error introduce into our measurement be much great a the reading of the data relies largely on human judgment and this introduces more error if a gas be excite it will emit a spectrum of light call an emission line spectrum when look at the spectral line produce by a hydrogen lamp through a diffraction grate only certain discrete visible wavelength be able to be see the hydrogen lamp work by passing an electrical current through a hydrogen gas in a vacuum small vacuum which in turn excites the electron within the hydrogen to a high energy level 1 when these electron drop back down to their original state photon be emit that correspond to the difference in the energy level that they have move between because of the quantisation of light give by where h=planck 's constant =frequency of e.m wave it be clear that these correspond change in energy will have discrete wavelength for a hydrogen atom the visible line observe will have wavelength that correspond to the balmer series of hydrogen these wavelength that be observe can be described by the rydberg formula where r be the rydberg constant p be the excite electron energy level initial state and n be the level that the electron drop back down to final state for the balmer series of hydrogen n be equal to 2 and all the line in the visible emission spectrum will be drop down to this energy level from this equation we can infer that the large the transition in energy level the great the difference between n and p the small the wavelength of the photon produce therefore agree with 1 for different series such a the lymann series the value of n will change the rydberg constant be a know physical constant that have be determine to be 10,973,731.57m -1 1 and be originally use by rydberg a a fitting parameter and only later be it discover by niels bohr that the constant could in fact be calculate use other more fundamental constant for this experiment the visible wavelength of light correspond to the excite energy level 3 4 and 5 with each respectively have the colour red aqua and violet determine the rydberg constant 224+9 this angle be essentially the adjustment angle and every angle measure can be take away from this in order to find the actual diffraction angle have set up the equipment spectrometer we be now able to switch off the sodium lamp and replace it with the hydrogen lamp and place the diffraction grate in the slot do this we be able to see the emission spectrum for the balmer series of red aqua and violet at different angle and order the diffraction grate have a value of 78.8 line per mm -1 correspond to a slit separation d of 1.269x10 -5 m. move only the telescope we align the cross wire with the center of each visible line and take down the angle and the arcminute value read from the vernier scale on the spectrometer my lab partner then move the telescope and focus it on the same point and take another reading this be do a to give u an estimate of the error in the angle a the vernier scale be very difficult to read in the light in measure the colour we do all of them in one go a to not miscount the order of the line do this we go in the order red aqua violet have collect the data for a many order of diffraction that we be able to observe the value of the angle be able to be process by average the two reading convert them to degree use 1 arcminute= be able to be plot with each of the wavelength able to be calculate use 5 for the red spectral line produce by the hydrogen the number of visible order range from -4 to 4 and the line of best fit through these point have a gradient determine to be 0.0517513±0.00012959 the gradient and error in the gradient be determine in python use the polyfit function and the covariance matrix produce by the data rearrange 5 you 're able to see where  𝑑 be equal to the gradient use d=1.269x10 -5 m we calculate the wavelength of the red light produce from the balmer series to be 656.7429±1.6446nm the error in the wavelength of the light be calculate use propagation of error with the equation 5 where z be a general function of variable x y … 𝜎 𝑥 𝑦 … be the error in the variable and 𝜎 𝑧 be the error in the function apply this to 6 you get the equation where 𝜎 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑 be the absolute error in the gradient in the gradient give u the error in  the know value of the red light emit from the balmer series be 656.28nm 6 compare this value with the wavelength we obtain it can be see that our result coincides with this a the actual value fall within the range of error for the red wavelength calculate from the graph to calculate the rydberg constant for this wavelength of light we rearrange equation 2 sub our value of the wavelength 656.7429nm a well a n=2 and p=3 n be always 2 for the balmer series we can calculate the rydberg constant for the red wavelength to be 1,096,319,4.18±27,453.07m -1 this give a fractional uncertainty of ±0.2504 the error in the rydberg constant can be found by apply 7 to 2 and rearrange give the general error in the rydberg constant a where   and  𝑅  be the error in wavelength and rydberg constant the know value of the rydberg constant 1.0974x10 7 m -1 fall within the range of error on the calculate value for red light  1.0963±0.00274 x10 7 m -1 this small error in the constant arises from the precision of the spectrometer when measure the value of  we take two reading and to find the standard error in the angle we use   ±0.5 × 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 where the range be the modulus of the difference between the 2 measurement a all of the measurement that we take have a range of between 0-5 arcminute difference the error in the angle be always very small use the propagation of error 2 the error in sin be show go be use the error in sin the polyfit function be use in python with a weight base on the reciprocal of the error in sin this produce an equation for the line of best fit and a covariance matrix add error bar to all the data point you can see in fig 4 that they 're extremely small and be almost not visible this be because through the propagation of error the error in sin mainly depends on the error in the angle which be very small due to the precision of the spectrometer for the red wavelength the line spectrum be also very clear this meant that it be clear to see where the center of the red line be perfectly align with the cross wire and in do so reduce the uncertainty in the measurement take by both myself and my lab partner however this will not have be the only source of error in this experiment when set up the spectrometer so that the diffraction grate be perfectly perpendicular to the incoming light there may have be many small error in the measurement take when reading the vernier scale this would lead to a small error in the way that the light diffracts a the wave would not be incident on the space perfectly perpendicular and a a result the diffraction grate equation 5 would not hold perfectly true although it would almost another thing that may have cause some error be the thickness of the mirror/diffraction grate if the mirror have an uneven surface then when we set up the spectrometer there would have again be some error in how perpendicular the grate would have be to the incoming wave and the same applies for the diffraction grate of course a with most experiment there will also be random error when look through the telescope the angle at which you hold your eye will affect how you see the spectral line and their position relative to the cross wire in order to try and reduce this we take the two measurement but to decrease this far we could 've take more reading a possible random error that may have also occur be that we may have knock the turntable slightly result in a slight change in the vernier scale lead to the measurement follow this 'knock to be off by a systematic amount for the aqua spectral line produce by the hydrogen the number of visible order range from -5 to 5 fig 4 and be clearly the brightest/most intense of all the spectral line visible the line of best fit through these point fig 4 have a gradient determine to be 0.0383581±0.00015040 a for the red spectrum the error in this gradient be determine in python use the covariance matrix use 6 we be able to calculate the aqua wavelength to be 486.7785±1.9087nm the error in the wavelength be found use the same error analysis a previously do for the red wavelength of light use 8 for the balmer series the know value of the aqua light emit from hydrogen be 486.13nm 6 compare the value we found for the aqua light to the know value we can see that the found value be accurate a the know value fall within the error boundary calculate to calculate the rydberg constant for this wavelength of light we a before use equation 9 sub our value of the wavelength 486.7785nm a well a n=2 and p=4 n be always 2 for the balmer series we can calculate the rydberg constant for the aqua wavelength to be 10,956,386.37±42960.77m -1 give a fractional uncertainty of ±0.3921 the error in the rydberg constant be a before calculate use 10 a the know value of the aqua wavelength be accurate to within the error bound it follow suit that the rydberg constant be also accurate a the actual value 1.0973x10 7 m -1 lie within the error boundary of the calculate value for aqua wavelength 1.0956±0.004296 x10 7 m -1 the calculate value of the rydberg constant for the aqua wavelength be far from the know value than the red wavelength this seem strange a the aqua fringe be much more visible when look at the spectrum through the telescope and so it should have be easy to place the cross wire exactly on the fringe the fact that there 's a high error and less accurate constant would suggest that there be a large deviation of individual point on fig 4 from the line of best fit lead to a large uncertainty in the gradient and through the propagation of error the rydberg constant this spread of value could have be a result of random error in the measurement a discus earlier it may also have be due to the point plot on the 4 th order m=4 here the value of sin fall significantly below the line of best fit and may have result in the polyfit function give a large uncertainty in the covariance matrix this value may have just be a random error in take the measurement where both my lab partner and i read the vernier scale wrong such a by half a degree finally for the violet spectral line produce by the hydrogen the number of visible order range from -4 to 5 fig 4 and be the faintest/most difficult to see of all the spectral line visible the line of best fit through these point fig 4 have a gradient determine to be 0.0343022±0.000080218 a for the other spectrum the error in this gradient be determine in python use the covariance matrix of the polyfit function use 6 we be able to calculate the violet wavelength to be 435.3076± 1.0180nm once again the error in the wavelength be found use the same error analysis do for the red and blue spectrum use 8 the know wavelength of violet light emit by the balmer series of hydrogen be 434.05nm 6 unlike the previous two wavelength the know value for the violet light do not fall within the error bound of the value we calculate follow on from this the result rydberg constant found from this wavelength be 10,939,172.35±25,582.01m -1 which like the wavelength do not coincide with the actual rydberg constant a the actual value do n't fall within the error boundary the fractional uncertainty for the value obtain be ±0.2339 this value for the rydberg constant be the furthest from the actual value of all of the wavelength we measure yet despite this it have the small fractional uncertainty in the value this suggests that the data plot follow the strong trend and the point be the least spread out from the line of best fit this strange contradiction could have be a result of the turntable be slightly unknowingly adjust between take the aqua result and the violet a we take the violet result last they would be the only result effect in such a way if the turntable be move and the vernier scale adjust slightly in the positive direction it would explain why the gradient increase a the positive value for the order would increase slightly and the negative one would decrease lead to a steeper gradient if the gradient be slightly more shallow the wavelength calculate would be small and may have be closer to the know value of 434.05nm another thing to consider for the violet light be that the line spectrum of this wavelength have the low intensity and be the hardest to see because of this we be not able to take measurement for all of the order with 3 reading that we be not able to see -5 -3 and 3. because this data be miss from the graph we do n't know how it may have affected the gradient if the point be there then the gradient may have either be different or the uncertainty in the gradient may have increase lead to the rydberg fall within the error bound v. conclusion this investigation have be to determine the rydberg constant use the rydberg formula 2 this be do by find different wavelength from the line emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp and measure the angle of diffraction through grate spectrometry and use equation 5 to determine the wavelength of each wavelength emit correspond to different energy level transition in the balmer series use this method we obtain 3 result for the rydberg constant for different wavelength of light that be all within a percentage difference from the actual value of the constant by ±0.3149 although the rydberg constant for the violet wavelength do not have error bound that fell within the actual value it be still extremely close and still a good approximation of the rydberg constant from the result you can see that the relationship between the sine of the angle of diffraction and order be linear confirm 5 and from the similarity of the 3 value calculate for the rydberg constant it show that the rydberg formula very accurately describes the wavelength of an emit photon when an electron change transition level within a hydrogen atom in order to improve the experiment we would have carry out the experiment multiple time take multiple reading at least 3 for each measure angle each time we repeat the experiment we would have set up the diffraction grate again so if there be any systematic error in the set up it would be eliminate by take the average result for the angle from the different experiment we could have also carry these experiment out in a darker room alone a there be other light source in the room which make it more difficult to see the spectrum despite a very accurate value for the rydberg constant have already be obtain it be still important to revisit old theory that be still very much valid today and continue to test them in use equation 5 and combine it with the rydberg formula 2 we be able to determine accurate value for the rydberg constant with small error within which the know value lie",deep,exp

light source produce a spectrum where emission be concentrate at particular discrete wavelength and spectrum be specific to each element the consequence of spectroscopy have far numerous area of physic aid the study of object on scale from nanometre to parsec one such example be the analysis of the position of spectral line of the light from distant star to determine property such a their constituent element temperature and velocity l a discus in the theory section the rydberg constant be pivotal in the understand of these spectrum not only do it relate the wavelength of an emit photon to the change in energy state of the atom 's electron but it can be express in term of other fundamental constant by consider bohr 's model of the atom 2 therefore very precisely determine the value of rydberg 's constant work both to verify important aspect of atomic and quantum theory and to far establish the value of other constant this experiment aim to define rydberg 's constant to a high level of accuracy and precision and it result will show the extent to which this be possible in the laboratory spectroscopy u a lens or miirnr to produce a collimate beam of light and disperses it with a diffraction grate or prism the disperse spectrum be focus and view with an eyepiece a diffraction grate can be consider a n equally space nairnw slit with slit separation d. maximum occur where

arcminute to degree be the overall angle in degree iv experimentalmethod a preliniinaiy test where the hydrogen discharge lamp be left switch on to determine it longevity show that the lamp would overheat and dramatically decrease in intensity after approximately fifteen minute since the focus and alignment can be complete with any light source an altemative such a a sodium lamp whose intensity do not noticeably decrease with time be found to be useful although a sodium lamp would produce a different spectnun the position of the zeroth order maximum be identical for all light source and be the only order necessa1y for calibration in order to take precise and accurate measurement it be necessa1y to fully calibrate the spectrometer the dial on the front of the eyepiece be use to focus on the crosshair for optimum result the focus of the camera should be at infinity this be impossible so the diffraction grate be remove and the camera be focus on a distant well lit object in the order of ten of meter away in order to find the point at which the telescope be exactly align with the axis of the collimator the telescope be rotate until a vertical band of light be visible at the intersection of the crosshair the crosshair be rotate to appear a an x rather than a '+ to make it easy to dete1mine the exact position where the band of light intersect the centre of the crosshair in order to precisely dete1mine this position the slit width be adjust to be close to it minimum a the band oflight be not exactly ve1tical screw on the grate table be adjust to alter it height the collimator be then focus on the crosshair so that the edge of the light beam be well define the value on the vernier scale be record at this position and the telescope rotate exactly 90° clockwise in order to be perpendicular to the axis of the collimator in order to then exactly align the diffraction grate with the normal of the collimator a plane mitrnr be place in the diffraction

this process ensure that the diffraction grate be exactly normal to the axis of the colliniator the plane mirror be then replace with a diffraction grate of specification 300 line per millinietre to

emission line be record measurement be repeat and an average angle for each emission line calculate the experiment be can-ied out in a dark laborato1y to eliminate a much background light a possible which would have inte1fered with the resultant spectmm the emission spectmm from the hydrogen discharge lamp appear approximately a show in fig 6. only three colour of spectral line be observe red cyan and violet give that the relative intensity of the violet line decrease a the value of n increase l it be deduce that this spectral line could only sensibly coll'espond to a nvalue of either n 5 or n 6. the intensity of the maximum decrease a the order increase to the extent that there be no third order positive or negative line for the violet light the central maximum appear a a bright pink-pwple colour due to the supe1position of wave of each colour and the dispropo1tionately high intensity of the red spectral line the angle at which the central maxinia be found be subtract from all measurement to calculate 0. although the vemier scale be accu1'ate to 1160 th of a degree it be deem unrealistic that the angle could be measu1'ed to this degree of accuracy a it be fairly difficult to detennine which two line on the low and upper scale be exactly align therefore an e1rnr of 6 arcminute 0.1 degree for each measurement be chosen since the final measurement of 0 be an average of two individual measurement the e1rnrs be add via the quadrature method since there be too few measurement to calculate a standard deviation to give an overall e1rnr in 0 of 0.07° this translates to an e1rnr of 1.22 x 10-3 in sin 0. a plot of sin0 against order m for the hydrogen lamp be show in fig 7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the least square method be use to dete1mine the gradient of the linear fit line which be weight by the 4 inverse of the ell'or in sin0 this gradient be directly proportional to the wavelength a show in 3 wavelength of 432.0 nm 482.2 nm and 636.0 nm be evaluate for violet cyan and red spectral line respectively to 4 significant figure the e1rnr in these wavelength be calculate to be 15.09 nm the value of the rydberg constant r 00 can be detennined individually for each colour of spectral line the result of which be show in table 3. it be also possible to plot the wavelength of each colour spectral line against a specify function of n a discus in appendix 2. the result of calculate the rydberg constant individually be show in table 1. since the value of n for the violet spectral line be undetermined the constant for both possible value of n be calculate i. the value and their uncertainty be quote to four significant figure error calculate with the quadrature method .. violet 1 corresponds to an electron transition from the sixth to the second energy level violet2 corresponds to an electron transition from the fifth to the second energy level the accepted value for the rydberg constant be 1.097 x 10 7 m-1 to 4 sf 5 the rydberg constant be expect to have the same value for all colou1 's of spectral line systematic e1rnrs would have contribute fairly equally to all colour of spectral line and repeat give some confidence that the violet spectral line diffraction angle have be coll'ectly measu1'ed give that the value of the rydberg constant for violet2 be also closer to the accepted value it be therefore dete1mined that the violet spectral line observe coll'esponded to an n-value of five this be deem sufficient ground to exclude the violet 1 result the standard e1rnr of the mean rydberg constant over the three colou1 's of spectral line be determine by two method and the validity and appropriateness of each ass the first method calculate the ell'or by quadrature result in an e1rnr of 194500 m-1 the second by calculate the standard deviation of the data to give an estimate of the random ell'or in the mean which give an ell'or of 94070 m-1 give that three data point be insufficient to calculate a representative standard deviation the large ell'or be accepted this result in an overall rydberg constant of 1.113 ± 0.019 x 10 7 m-1 to 4 sf represent a percentage difference of 1.46 from the true value the accepted value be therefore within the standard error of the measure constant the systematic error cause the discrepancy between the accepted and measure value could be due to an error in the value of the slit separation d. the option of a diffraction grate with 80 line per millimetre be also available but the grate with 300 line per millimetre be more suitable for the experiment a justified in the experimental method section this alternative diffraction grate in the laboratory be label a 80 line per millimetre but be discover in fact to have be manufacture use imperial unit and therefore have 2000 line per inch 6 this discrepancy could also apply to the diffraction grate with 300 line per millimetre which be use in the experiment if so a '300 line per millimetre grate would correspond to 7500 line per inch therefore the grate would have approximately 295.3 line per millimetre correspond to a small value of d. a small value of d would increase the value of the wavelength for all colour of spectral line and therefore decrease the calculate value of the rydberg constant however if this theory be to be apply the new calculate constant disregard error would be 1.096 ± 0.020 ´ 10 7 m -1 to 4 s f. lead to the conclusion that although other systematic error may be present an incorrect value of d could largely explain the discrepancy in the value of the rydberg constant an error in the value of d explains why the constant increase a the value of n decrease if the diffraction grate have a value of d small than 300 see 5 the value of sinq would decrease by a small amount due to this error when the wavelength of light be small this would result in the wavelength calculate be small than the true value for all colour of spectral line with violet line be the least affected the rydberg constant be inversely proportional to the wavelength therefore the constant would increase by the small amount for violet spectral line due to this error and by the large amount for red spectral line another possible error could be due to the diffraction grate not be exactly normal to the axis of the collimator more thorough examination of the data collect show slight discrepancy between the angle measure at opposite order where the expectation be that the diffraction angle would be identical this be especially noticeable in the red spectral line which could have contribute to the value of the rydberg constant for these spectral line be large than that for cyan or violet spectral line the value of rydberg 's constant be successfully determine by measure the diffraction angle of the spectral line produce by a hydrogen discharge lamp the accepted value be found to lie within the standard error of the measure value demonstrate the accuracy of the spectrometer a an instrument however a relatively low precision of 1.71 be achieve give that the vernier scale be accurate to the near arcminute or to 0.017° this be due to a large error in q. give that the error reduces by the inverse of the square root of the number of reading take this error could have be reduce by increase the number of measurement it be also possible that an error of 6 arcminute 0.1° on the diffraction angle reading be an overestimate a this be six time large than the precision of the instrument additional measurement would have also far detailed the error result from the diffraction grate not be normal to the axis of the collimator and therefore necessary compensation could have be make many laboratory condition could have contribute to the total statistical error the refractive index of air varies with temperature and pressure 7 so small variation in these condition would alter the diffraction angle give that all the data be collect in one laboratory session the temperature and air pressure be unlikely to have significantly change between measurement carry out the experiment in a vacuum chamber would have fully overcome these problem the high the intensity of the spectral line the easy it be found to determine their exact position due to the nature of the hydrogen lamp the intensity of the spectral line decrease with time high order be measure last for all colour so the accuracy of the diffraction angle decrease for these measurement to tackle this issue the hydrogen lamp should have be replace or switch off and allow to cool frequently and the measurement take in a random order to reduce the effect of this error in the conclusion section the presence of an error in the slit separation be theorise future experiment could look to test this theory for the diffraction grate with 300 line per millimetre these find would be extremely useful for future optic laboratory experiment a n-value of five be use for the violet emission line a discus in the result error and discussion section the gradient of the linear fit be 8.484 ± 0.136 ´ 10 -8 m to 3 d.p which yield a rydberg constant of 1.179 ± 0.019 ´ 10 7 m -1 to 3 d.p this be a fairly large discrepancy between this value and the value of the constant when calculate for each spectral line individually this be likely to be due in majority to the inaccuracy of a linear fit for so few data point 8 if several more spectral line have be observe and measure this method would have be superior for determine the rydberg constant,extended,bal
53,GS_EIW693_Redacted,"in the follow experiment the rydberg constant r be calculate use a grate spectrometer the angle of diffraction 𝜃 of the spectral line be use to calculate the transition wavelength of the balmer series for the hydrogen emission spectrum this be do use the grate equation the transition wavelength be then far use to calculate multiple value for the rydberg constant the mean of these value be calculate to give one final value for r which be 10790078.35 ± 23082.98 𝑚 −1 and be within 2 of the know value in this experiment we use a spectrometer which consists of a collimator diffraction grate 78.8 line per mm and telescope to calculate the rydberg constant a hydrogen lamp be use a a source of light we use our knowledge of bohr 's postulate and transition series to calculate the angle of diffraction of the balmer series we use our knowledge of wave and diffraction to calculate the transition wavelength this experiment make u use knowledge we already have to calculate an extremely important constant we calculate the rydberg constant a it can be calculate to a high precision and accuracy even while use first year lab equipment it importance stem from the fact that it be connect to many fundamental constant a can be see below in eq.4 a see in fig 1. the light from the source enters through an adjustable slit which make it a narrow beam of light the slit be position at the focus of the collimator the beam of light be therefore collimate and convert into a parallel beam this light then hit the diffraction grate which disperses it such that diffraction angle 𝜃 depends upon the wavelength of light 𝜆 and the slit separation 𝑑 of the grate when different colour of light enter the spectrometer they be diffract by different angle therefore green and red light can be see have different value of 𝜃. the telescope be attach to an arm that rotates the angle of rotation can be accurately measure use the vernier scale situate on the base of the arm the eye-piece have a perpendicular set of crosshairs that help in accurately reference and hence accurately measure the rotation angle a diffraction grate be technically a number n of narrow equally-spaced slit with separation 𝑑 𝑑=1/n between slit a maximum occurs when the phase difference ∆𝜙 between two ray of light of wavelength 𝜆 be an integer multiple 𝑚 of 2𝜋 𝑚 be know a the order number 3 transition series in hydrogen and the rydberg constant accord to bohr 's postulate an electron can orbit the nucleus in a stable orbit without lose energy therefore it energy be constant in that orbit and only change when it move to a different orbit an electron can move to a high orbit by absorb energy i.e by absorb a certain wavelength of electro-magnetic radiation it can also move to a low orbit by emit a certain wavelength of electro-magnetic radiation the transition wavelength can be calculate use the formula where n be the energy level of the initial state and p be the energy of the final state of the electron 𝑅 be the rydberg constant it have a value of 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 and can be write in term of some fundamental constant a where 𝑐 be the speed of light ℎ be plank 's constant 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of an electron and 𝛼 be the fine structure constant 1/ 𝛼=137.036 𝛼 be dimensionless the balmer transition series in hydrogen be when p=2 and n=3,4,5,6…this mean that the electron be drop down from high energy level to the 2 nd energy level the balmer transition wavelength be part of the visible spectrum the follow sequence of operation be follow to align and focus the spectrometer correctly so a to get accurate reading i keep both eye open the eyepiece be focus on the cross-wire so a to remove strain on the eye ii the camera be focus on a distant object 5-10 meter away so a to remove parallax between the cross-wire and the image iii the hydrogen line from a hydrogen lamp tend to grow weaker a the tube age and therefore it get harder to take reading during an experiment therefore a sodium lamp be use to set up the spectrometer and the hydrogen lamp be kept untouched till the start of the experiment iv the telescope which consists of the camera and eyepiece be align with the axis of the collimator the helium lamp be kept near the slit to illuminate it the collimator be then focus to get a sharp image of the slit on the cross-wire this be do without change the focus of the camera v the camera and collimator be align so that the slit be at the cross-wires and the reading of the two scale be note at 180°0′ vi the telescope be move through 90° to the point where the scale read 90°0′ and be clamped a grate of value 78.8. line per mm be put in the holder the grate surface be not touch a it be very fragile vii the grate table be rotate until a reflect image of the slit be see in the eyepiece this indicate that the grate surface be at 45° to the incident beam viii the grate be then rotate by precisely 45° to set it at normal incidence ix the telescope be rotate to large angle it be found that the image of the slit be not at the same height the adjustment screw at the bottom of the grate table be use to make the grate ruling precisely parallel to the rotation axis of the table this be do so that all the image be at the same height i the sodium lamp be replace by the hydrogen lamp and the slit width be kept to the minimum so a to reduce the uncertainty ii the telescope be kept so that the central un-diffracted image of the slit be at the cross-hairs and the reading on the scale be record this be the zero point and be use a reference iii the telescope be then move from the zero point to the right and then to the left the angle of diffraction of the three different colour line red cyan and blue be record they be record up until the 4 th order in both the positive and negative direction i.e for m=-4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 4. the red cyan and blue line correspond to the transition wavelength of n=3,4 and 5 respectively iv four reading be take per line two by me and two by my partner this help reduce random error and give a value of uncertainty for the angle of diffraction of each line the uncertainty for the diffraction angle of each line be calculate by first calculate the standard deviation 𝑠 use the scipy library on python and then find the standard error of measurement by use the formula where 𝑛 𝑖 be the number of observation in this case 𝑛 𝑖 4. v the average of the four reading be take this be 𝜃 𝑅 𝜃 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜃 𝐵 for the red cyan and blue line respectively three plot be make on python of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑅 𝑣𝑠 𝑚 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝐶 𝑣𝑠 𝑚 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝐵 𝑣𝑠 𝑚. the gradient and uncertainty of the gradient be calculate through analysis on python vii 𝑑 be calculate use the formula 𝑑 1 𝑁 and it uncertainty be estimate a the manufacturer do not provide one discus far in section iv vii a can be see from eq 2. the gradient of the plot be equal to 𝜆 𝑑 therefore each of the slope be multiply by 𝑑 to find the transition wavelength for red n=3 cyan n=4 and blue n=5 which be 𝜆 𝑅 𝜆 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜆 𝐵 respectively the uncertainty of the various wavelength be calculate by add in quadrature the uncertainty of the gradient and the uncertainty of 𝑑. viii the rydberg constant be calculate for each colour separately use eq 3. where p=2 and n=3,4 and 5 for red 𝜆 𝑅 cyan 𝜆 𝐶 and blue 𝜆 𝐵 respectively the uncertainty for the 3 value of the constant 𝜎 𝑅 𝜎 𝑐 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜎 𝐵 for red cyan and blue respectively be calculate use the formula 𝜎 𝑍 𝑑𝑧 𝑑𝑥 𝜎 𝑥 a r be a function of 𝜆. ix finally the mean of the 3 value of the rydberg constant be found to give one final value of the constant the uncertainty be found by add in quadrature 𝜎 𝑅 𝜎 𝑐 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜎 𝐵 x there be also a 4 th line which be violet in colour and corresponds to the transition wavelength of n=6 the violet colour line be barely visible especially during the high order line and be therefore ignore discus far in section iv there be also some fade line of various colour in-between the line of the hydrogen spectrum these be ignore too discus far in section iv grate for student lab be produce by take a cast of a master grate this be do use a suitable material such a cellulose acetate when the cast dry it be remove from the master grate there be usually some shrinkage and therefore these replica be never a good a the master therefore the uncertainty in 𝑁 be estimate to be ±2 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑚𝑚 t j glynn 1993 the data for the diffraction angle can be found in section vii 3 rydberg constant cyan 𝜆 𝐶 𝑛 4 the data for the diffraction angle can be found in section vii the data for the diffraction angle can be found in section vii table .3. during the experiment it be observe that there be a faint violet colour line a part of the first and second order line this line be n't visible in the high order spectral line this line be that of transition wavelength 410.17nm and n=6 it be part of the balmer series but be barely visible a it lie on the edge of the visible spectrum very close to the ultra-violet part of the spectrum our cone our not very sensitive to this part of the visible spectrum and therefore we be unable to see these line past the second order there be also some random faint line of different colour in the middle of the red cyan blue and violet line of the atomic hydrogen spectrum these line be part of the emission spectrum of molecular hydrogen a the tube age the atomic hydrogen spectrum line become dimmer and the line of the molecular hydrogen spectrum become brighter james e. park 2002 this be why the reading be take quickly and the lamp be periodically switch off to let it cool the possible random error have already be state but there be also a few possible source of systematic error if the beam from the source be n't collimate properly the ray of light would hit the diffraction grate at various angle and this could lead to the ray be diffract at different angle than expect another possible source of systematic error be that when the hydrogen lamp be left on for too long the intensity of the light from it reduce this lead to the maximum become dimmer and the minimum become brighter therefore there be n't much of a difference between the appearance of a maximum and minimum and the diffraction angle of a minimum might have be record instead of that of a maximum systematic error could also have occur due to human error such a reading the vernier scale wrong the vernier scale be read use a magnify glass and due to parallax error the scale could have be read wrong it be also extremely easy to not align the instrument properly lead to faulty reading the calculate value of r be 𝟏𝟎𝟕𝟗𝟎𝟎𝟕𝟖 𝟑𝟓 ± 𝟐𝟑𝟎𝟖𝟐 𝟗𝟖 𝒎 −𝟏 the merit of this experiment be that a spectrometer be use which be a highly accurate device which when properly align have a precision of ±0.2𝑛𝑚 for yellow light it be easy to take a large amount of data use the spectrometer and this help reduce the random error in the value of the angle of diffraction wavelength and hence the rydberg constant this be evident in the final result which be within 2 of the accepted value of r and in the uncertainty which be 0.2 and be very small some demerit of this experiment be that it use a hydrogen lamp which tends to get dim and this could lead to systematic error there be a high chance of human error during the alignment and measurement process the use of the replica of a grate also lead to an uncertainty this be evident in the result a the random error be not large enough to make up for the discrepancy in the calculate value this mean that it be systematic error which be

54,GS_DAG780_Redacted,the experiment cover in this report be carry out to calculate the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy and precision the method apply involve use a diffraction grate to separate the wavelength of light from a hydrogen discharge tube and then observe the diffraction angle of the different wavelength use a spectrometer the spectral line in the visible light spectrum make up part of the balmer series for which the electron energy level transition be know therefore use the diffraction grate formula and rydberg formula the wavelength of the spectral line can be calculate and the rydberg constant can be determine the value we obtain for the rydberg constant be 1.0940  10 7 ± 6.7  10 4 m -1 give a percentage error of 0.61 which show the high precision of our value this result be within 0.30 of the correct value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 which show that it be also very accurate ohann balmer first discover an equation that could accurately predict the position of the visible spectral line for atomic hydrogen in 1885. he derive this equation empirically use measurement of hydrogen line in the solar spectrum just five year later johannes rydberg generalize this into a formula that could predict the wavelength of any of the line in the hydrogen emission spectrum and later it be extend for other hydrogen-like ion that have a nucleus with one electron the spectral line described by balmer 's equation be know a the balmer series five other spectral series for the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen be later discover name after their correspond discoverer there be more series beyond this but these be unnamed all of these series have similar closely link equation which describe the position of the spectral line a outline by rydberg 's general formula for all wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum however a theoretical understand of why these formula work do not arrive until niels bohr offer his model of the atom in 1913 1 in this model the electron in the hydrogen atom be say to occupy a discrete quantum energy level brought about by the electrostatic force between the electron and proton these energy state can be visualize a distinct orbit of the electron around the central nucleus the electron be capable of transition through energy state but since the energy of each state be fix only distinct jump correspond to specific energy can be make when hydrogen gas be heat to high temperature the electron will jump up from it original energy level to a high one this leaf the electron in an unstable state so it jump back down to it original position release a photon which have energy equivalent to the difference between the energy of the energy level each transition will always produce a photon of the same energy and wavelength so specific colour in the electromagnetic light spectrum can be observe and these line make up the hydrogen spectral series many model have be propose before this but bohr 's model be rapidly accepted because it be the first one to account for the structure of the empirical rydberg formula his theory demonstrate how the rydberg formula reflect the discrete energy state transition of the electron in a hydrogen atom bohr be also able to define a constant within the rydberg formula know a the rydberg constant in term of more fundamental quantity be able to determine the rydberg constant accurately by experimental procedure be significant because hydrogen be the most abundant element in the universe and it spectral emission line from stellar object be observe and analyse frequently in optical astronomy the aim in this investigation be to determine an experimental value for the rydberg constant which be both accurate and precise have a low percentage error the spectrometry apparatus use in this experiment should have a high accuracy which should theoretically allow for the measurement for the value to a few part in a thousand each energy level of the hydrogen atom have a define associate energy for an electron occupy that level these level be represent by integer know a the principal quantum number the far the electron from the nucleus the large the number at it ground state n=1 the electron be at it low possible energy level and be consider stable the electron can be raise to an excite state if energy be supply to it when the electron transition back down to the determine the rydberg constant use grate spectrometry j the intensity of maximum decrease with increase θ and through preliminary observation it can be quickly determine that the order of maximum can not be detect clearly above m ±3 therefore for each wavelength 3 order of maximum will be measure on either side of the central maximum even though the balmer series consists of 4 spectral line in the visible spectrum the shortest wavelength line be difficult to resolve due to background light and so be exclude the reference angle at which the diffraction angle be zero and the purple mixture of all the wavelength could be see be measure to be 204° 5′ where ′ represent one arcminute and be equivalent to 1/60 of a degree the reading for θ be make when the crosshair be center in the middle of the spectral line each line have a measure thickness of 4′ which contributes an error of ±2′ to θ. another source of uncertainty arose from the difficulty in reading the vernier scale and the error for be approximate from the variation in repeat measurement which turn out to be ±3′ therefore the standard error in the diffraction angle θ be estimate to be 𝜎θ ±5′ or 0.083° and this error be propagate to give a standard error in sin θ and hence the error in the gradient and wavelength could be determine a potential source of systematic error in this experiment would be due to the refractive index of air since the rydberg formula calculates wavelength for light in a vacuum however since we have no method for measure the temperature or humidity of the laboratory environment it be difficult to estimate the refractive index of the air other factor that give rise to numerous possibility for systematic error include background light slit separation error and defocusing or misalignment of the spectrometer apparatus during experiment however it have be attempt to minimize or eliminate the effect of these factor a much a possible so we can therefore assume that their overall effect be negligible in our analysis the standard error for the rydberg constant for each wavelength be determine a follow the standard error of the mean for the rydberg constant could be found from the standard deviation of the value a rearrangement of 2 show that the gradient of the line in fig 5 can be use to calculate the wavelength of the spectral line a follow the diffraction grate have 300 line per mm so the slit separation d can be calculate to be 3.3  10 -1 m. table 1 show the gradient of each straight line fit for the three wavelength of spectral line obtain from fig 5 their correspond calculate wavelength and rydberg constant value with all associate error the final value of the rydberg constant be take a the mean average of these three value give r 1.0940  10 7 ± 6.7  10 4 m -1 the purpose of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant r to a high degree of accuracy and precision by reduce and eliminate the effect of systematic and random error through the experimental procedure and use of apparatus the value of the rydberg constant obtain have a percentage error of 0.61 and be within 0.30 of the correct value of the rydberg constant of 10 973 731.6 m -1 5 this show that our value be both accurate and precise and therefore our experiment successfully achieves the initial aim set out for the investigation our final outcome be significant because it show empirically that the experiment do match and reflect the underlie theory propose by bohr in his model for the atom it have also show that the experimental method we use be reliable and reproducible and that we be able to carry out the experiment to a high caliber with more time and resource available the experiment could have be improve far by make more measurement to reduce statistical uncertainty and more careful control or consideration of variable that could have add systematic error to our result,deep,bal

therefore compare the gradient of the plot to 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 verifies the value of rydberg 's constant in this experiment the hydrogen lamp act a a light source the adjustable slit locate at the collimator focal point confines the source to a define narrow beam the collimator ensures all the light be parallel and therefore strike the diffraction grate at the same angle of incidence this allows a sharp image of the slit to be view use the telescope when it be focus at infinity the follow step be take to ensure the spectrometer be correctly align and focus firstly the hydrogen lamp be place in the centre of the slit about 1cm away such that the most intense illumination of the slit be achieve and care be take to not alter it position throughout the experiment so a to avoid introduce a large systematic error secondly the eye piece be slid forward and backwards until the cross hair come into sharp focus and their orientation be adjust so one of the line would not be parallel to a spectral line this be do to aid take precise measurement next the telescope be align with collimator meaning the cross hair be on the slit image by rotate the telescope arm 90°and use a mirror the position of the grate table at which the reflect the cross hair be center on the slit image be found consequently when the grate table be rotate back 45° the diffraction grate be perpendicular to the optical axis afterwards the telescope be use to check outer maximum be in plane define by the cross wire confirm that the grate ruling be in fact parallel to the telescope rotation axis prior to take definitive data a selection of preliminary data be take one measurement for each observable maximum be record for the red blue and purple spectral line while take measurement attention be paid to prevent potential parallax error by view the perpendicular to the vernier scale arbitrarily it be decide that all reading should be take from the right edge of the spectral line the centre be not use because it would introduce an uncertainty in judging it position it be notice also that light from desk lamp and the magnify glass be affect the image view in the telescope to try to reduce background illumination we surround the collimator section with black card grate of 80 and 300 line per mm be test and it be conclude despite limit the range of observable maximum the increase resolution of the observable maximum provide by the 300 line per mm would be most appropriate finally observable maximum would be record for the red blue and purple spectral line twice each and 3 repeat would be do for each measurement the experiment equipment be set up and procedure follow a described in the experimental setup and preliminary investigation section for each

associate with ambiguity when judging the right edge of spectral line be estimate by have the same person take a few reading of the same spectral line 4 arc minute furthermore it be assume an error associate with defocus and misalignment exist and be about 2 arc minute to obtain the total error on the diffraction angle these source of error be combine in quadrature the variable of sin θ be compute by multiply the total error on the diffraction angle by co θ evaluate at each diffraction angle there be no error on m because it can only take discrete value in an attempt to verify the value of rydberg 's constant inverse wavelength be plot against the difference between the inverse-square of the correspond energy state and a least straight-line fit be implement see figure 5 the variable error of inverse wavelength be determine by multiply the error of the wavelength by the inverse-square of the wavelength there be also no error n because accord to bohr 's model it can only take discrete value analysis of the least square straight-line fit yield a gradient of 10.92+-27 ×10 6 𝑚 −1 the theory suggests if balmer series hold true then the fit should be a straight line through the origin whose gradient be equal to rydberg 's constant 10 973 731.6 𝑚 a percentage difference of only 0.5 implies linearity between the variable in equation 2 and verifies the value of rydberg 's constant moreover the accepted value lie within the calculate error bound signify the investigate do not incur substantial systematic error although the error bound be not optimal and change could certainly be make to decrease major source of random error and incorporate one not previously address in conclusion the experimental value of rydberg 's constant calculate 10.92+-27 ×10 6 𝑚 −1 have a small percentage difference from the accepted value of 0.5 thus i propose the experiment verify the value but that adaptation to the method could be make the high resolution provide by the 300 line per mm grate help reduce error due to ambiguity judging the position of the right edge of spectral line however high order of maximum be very dim meaning we be only able only record value for maximum of order ≤ 3. to resolve this i suggest use a 100 or 200 line per mm grate instead so we could obtain a great range of maximum and while maintain a high resolution another potential downfall be prioritise measure more diffraction pattern limited how small our error could be in the future we could instead take more repeat reading at each value despite prevent some background illumination the black card surround the collimator section be not ideal cover the entire setup with a black cloth would far reduce background illumination a potential source of error that be not confront be the presence of very weak spectral line due transition of molecular hydrogen that can sometimes be observe between the red blue and purple line this be problem because it can be difficult to distinguish from between the spectral line of hydrogen and molecular hydrogen transition at high order maximum to highlight it ramification the experiment could be repeat use a hydrogen lamp of different age because a a tube age the emission from molecular hydrogen grow strong and the hydrogen line grow weaker v",extended,the
56,GS_NHZ839_Redacted,spectroscopy be one of the most powerful tool we have at our disposal today for research and be use in many field include quantum physic and astronomy it relies on the way electro-magnetic wave interact with matter and how different wavelength may be affected this set of experiment be do to familiarise ourselves with the spectrometer a piece of equipement that allows the user to see the different wavelength compose a ray of light on the first experiment discus in this report our goal be to determine the rydberg constant which be part of the equation describe the wavelength emit by a hydrogen atom the spectrometer be base on one basic physical phenomenon diffraction and interference when a wave go through a slit approximately a wide a the wavelength it get diffract meaning that a parallel beam will come out of the slit a a cone the interference happens when there be multiple slit or in the case of the spectrometer a grate with a large number of slit a show in figure 1 when look with a telescope at an angle θ from the grate what be see be a superposition of all the wave come from each slit in the grate a these wave originate all from the same source they be in phase at the grate and their difference of phase at the telescope depends on the difference of length of the path they be take they will interfere constructively when their path difference be a multiple of their wavelength and destructively when it be half the wavelength plus some multiple a show in figure 1 the path difference of two neighbour slit be give by d sin θ where d be the slit width in the grate the purpose of have a large number of slit be to create more discrete interference pattern and thus locate constructive interference more easily a a result of the above when a beam of wavelength λ be pas through the grate a constructive interference occurs whenever where m be an integer which we will refer to a the order of the constructive interference a such have precise knowledge of d and θ allows you to find λ and even more interestingly when passing a beam compose of multiple wavelength through the grate the constructive interference will occur for different θ allow u to clearly see the different ray in this experiment we look at the light emit by a hydrogen lamp unlike a common incandescent light bulb which emits a continuous spectrum of light through thermal emission a hydrogen lamp emits a discrete set of wavelength this be do by the excitation of the electron around a hydrogen atom when this electron go from a high level of energy to a low one the lose energy will be emit a a photon a the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom be quantise so be the energy of the photon that can be emit by use the formula relate the enrgy of a photon to it frequency e hν where e be the energy ν be the frequence and h be planck 's constant it be easy to see that the possible emission wavelength be also quantise these wavelength be give by where n and p be integer represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the electron r ∞ be the rydberg constant which we want to determine on the spectrometer the user be able to rotate the grate and the telescope with good precision the angle be give by a vernier scale with space of 1 arcminute we first setup the telescope to focus on a distant image a it would be receive a parallel beam and align it with the collimator wich would produce the beam use the crosshair in the telescope we then want to align the grate so we rotate the telescope by exactly 90 degree and place a mirror on the grate table we then shone a light through the collimator and turn the mirror in order to have the light arrive exactly on the crosshair at this point we knew that the mirror be at a 45 degree angle so we be able to turn everything precisely back in place to have it all align 0 degree everywhere we put the narrow slit we could between the hydrogen lamp and the collimator to obtain narrow ray in the interference pattern however we be meant to see three different ray compose the light and only two appear so we have to widen the slit when we take data for the third ray in order to have a visible intensity the experiment be do in this way the hydrogen lamp emits an orange light wich be compose of three different ray one red one blue and one violet and other high wavelength ray which we could not see for each ray we turn the telescope until we found a constructive interference note the order and the angle each time this would allow u to determine each wavelength and in turn the rydberg constant 4 data analysis when do the setup we align everything properly but instead of have everything to 0 degree we have an initial offset of 180 • 7 the width of the slit in the grate be d 1.27 × 10 5 the raw value we obtain be in table 1. figure 2 3 and 4 show this data when the offset be take out from equation 1 the gradient give u λ/d which then give u λ a d be know we found value of λ red 658 nm λ blue 486 nm λ v iolet 436 nm the rydberg constant can then be deduce from equation 2. for this it be give to u that the hydrogen atom always fall back to a state of p 2 and so these λ correspond to n 3 4 and 5. we find r ∞ 1.11 × 10 7 m 1 which be close to the know value 10 973 731.6 m 1 to estimate the error on the final value the error on the measurement be need first reading the vernier scale prove to be quite difficult with the tiny scale and the dim light so we take an error of ± 3 the ray have a width of 3 when look through the telescope so this give u an error of ± 1.5 the overall error on θ for the red and blue ray be hence give by √ 3 2 1.5 2 ≈ 4 ′ for the violet ray a we have to widen the slit in order to let in more light the width of the ray be 15 so the overall error on θ be ±8 ′ to find the error on the wavelength a the error for d the space in the grate be much small than the error on θ we only take the error on θ. the error of λ be then give by calculate it for each value of θ and then divide the mean by the square root of the number of data point a it be the mean of an error this give u σ λ red ±10nm σ λ blue ±10nm σ λ v iolet ±30nm the error for 1/λ be then give by and we then use again the same methos of the mean of an error to calculate the error on the rydberg constant give u in the end this experiment show u that the spectrometer be a quite precise instrument a we found value close to the know one the wavelength found for the hydrogen lamp be 658 nm 486 nm and 436 nm which be very close to the actual value of 656.3 486.1 and 434.0. the actual rydberg constant be within our error a we found which go to show how accurate this equipement can be when it be our first time use it and in non optimal condition extension number 2 of this set of experiment even show how we can know the composition of the sun just by look at the wavelength it emits by compare them to those of know element it be also this that have allow the scientific community to discover quantum mechanic a it be heavily involve in many pioneer experiment such a the photoelectric effect or compton scatter overall it be a very precise

57,GS_TCQ490_Redacted,spectrometer be use to examine the spectrum of light emit by various source such a star crystal lamp an so on it be a very powerful tool a it give out data on multiple aspect of the light we make an attempt on measure the rydberg constant by follow the grate equation when light be pas through narrow slit diffraction occurs grate act a many narrow slit create many light beam with path difference which lead to phase difference these beam interact with each other create diffraction pattern maximum diffraction pattern happens when the phase difference be equal to integer multiple of 2π phase difference path difference ´2p l 2p m 1 1 where m be a integer also know a the order number λ be the wavelength of the light a show in where n be the number of slit when another light with different wavelength λ 2 be also pas through the slit a different diffraction pattern with maximum at different position be add to the imige now have two wavelength it can be deduce that then where dl be l -l 2 and be very small compare to λ. the rydberg constant r ¥ be give by 8 where n be initial state of the atom p be the final state of the atom which be all integer when atom be excite electron move to high energy state however it be less stable so they drop back to their ground state with a release of energy in the form of photon for hydrogen their ground state be p 2 and the electron be excite to different state to give out different wavelength of light fig 2 the setup of the spectrometer first focus the spectrometer to an object very far for example building out side the window put the grate in place very vertically and do not touch the grate itself then line up the light source in this case sodium lamp and hydrogen lamp with the collimator look into the eyepiece and adjust the width of the slit to be a small a possible but bright enough for the light to be observable after that make sure the crosshair be in the middle of the light beam and also the zero order of the light have no obvious split read and record the angle ±0.001° on the spectrometer then find the -2 order of the diffraction pattern aline the crosshair with one of the brightest colour observable record the angle and then turn to the next order until +2 order make sure to only work in one direction in order to avoid backlash the grate spectrometer 2 i. result first we try with sodium lamp however there be only one colour that be very bright so we only checked for symmetry to ensure that the spectrometer be correctly set up then the wavelength of the two colour can be determine by plot d sin θ against m accord to 4 the wavelength will be the gradient red the wavelength for red be 2.04e-04m the wavelength for blue be 2.76e-04m compare the two result to the wavelength of red light and blue light it be quite accurate,superficial,bal
58,GS_PUK317_Redacted,"the rydberg constant be an important theoretical constant that can be use to predict the wavelength of light emit by various electron energy change that can occur when an atom contain a single electron becomes excite and then dexcites in order to measure this constant a gas discharge tube be use to excite hydrogen whose emission spectrum be then analyse use diffraction spectroscopy three emit wavelength be found in the visible spectrum and be found to be part of the balmer series of emission because they be produce by an electron fall from high energy state to a state with a quantum number of 2. the rydberg constant be found to be 1.088 ± 0.007 x10 7 m −1 which be an uncertainty of six part per thousand t he rydberg constant be a theoretical constant use to predict the wavelength of spectral emission line the constant and it 's associate formula be base on empirical data rather than from a theoretical approach spectral emission occurs when an electron move from a high energy state to a low one and emits the excess energy a a photon whose wavelength be function of the associate energy change the prediction make with the constant and formula use in this report be only valid for a atom with a single electron such a hydrogen the rydberg constant can also be express in term of fundamental constant this show how precise determination of the rydberg constant can help to accurately determine other constant in order to analyse the emission spectrum generate by a hydrogen lamp a grate spectrometer be employ this spectrometer be capable of splitting a beam of light into it component colour use the dispersion property of diffraction grate by investigate each colour in turn and analyse the relationship between their wavelength the rydberg constant can be found the hydrogen lamp use a a light source in this report be a gas discharge tube fill with hydrogen at a reduce pressure and one end there be a hot cathode which emits electron and at the other end be an anode which strip electron off the surround gaseous molecule charge particle be accelerate by the electric field create by the potential difference apply to the terminal of lamp because of the reduce pressure they can accelerate to sufficient energy so that when they collide with neutral gaseous molecule they can strip off electron to create more ion or transfer some of their kinetic energy to the electron of the neutral molecule transfer them from a low energy state to a high energy excite state when these electron return to their low energy state the excess energy be release a a photon of light similarly when positive ion recombine with electron excess energy be release a photon of light in an atom electron can only occupy discrete energy level particular to that atom therefore when an electron be excite there be a finite number of photon energy it can emit to reduce it energy state each element have a unique emission spectrum of possible photon wavelength with hydrogen have the simplest because there be few allow energy change correspond to light in the visible range the wavelength of these emit photon for hydrogen can be predict by where λ be the predict wavelength r h be the rydberg constant and n and p be positive integer correspond to the initial and final energy state of the electron respectively for all case of photon emission n p a the electron be transfer from a high energy to a low one by find a range of emit wavelength and determine their relevant n and p value through data analysis that rydberg constant can be found the light emit from the hydrogen lamp contains multiple wavelength of light when it be incident on the diffraction grate found in the grate spectrometer the light will be diffract so that intensity maximum for each wavelength appear accord to where d be the separation of slit on the diffraction grate θ be the angle relative to the normal at which the maximum occurs and m be a positive or negative integer correspond to the order of the maximum from this equation it be clear that the amount by which these component colour of light be diffract be a function of the light wavelength such that the gradient of a graph of sin θ against maximum order be equal to λ/d this show how a grate spectrometer be able to split up light into it various colour in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to analyse the emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp the lamp be place directly in front of the slit opening in the back of the spectrometer with the slit size reduce so that the spectral line be visible but a thin a possible in order to maximise the resolution of maximum location the light that enters the spectrometer be divergent so first pas through a collimator lens which directs the ray so that they be parallel once they leave the collimator the light be then incident onto a diffraction grate perpendicular to the light path this grate have a slit separation of 1.25 x10 −5 m. once light pas through the grate each component colour diffracts so that maximum appear accord to equ 3 the telescope of the grate spectrometer can move so it be at a constant distance from and always look directly at the centre of the diffraction grate for each colour in turn the telescope swept across the area in which the maximum could be observe note the angle reading on the vernier scale resolution of 1 arcminute when the crosshair in the centre of the eyepiece mount on the end of the telescope be at the centre of the maximum line the movement be do in such a way that the telescope do not have to change direction in between measurement to prevent mechanical backlash the hydrogen lamp be switch off while measurement be take place to reduce an effect that the heating of the lamp my have and also prevent damage to the lamp the order of maximum can be determine by compare their position to the position of the central maximum which can be easily identify because at this point every component colour will also have their central maximum value of θ at each maximum be found by take the difference between the angle reading at this maximum and the angle reading at the central maximum use the relationship described in equ 3 the wavelength of each colour can then be found the value for n and p for each wavelength can be found through reason and analysis of the data primarily use the fact that if wavenumber 1/λ be plot on 1/n 2 -1/p 2 then a perfectly negative linear relationship with gradient equal to -r h be expect to be found once p and n be determine for each value of λ r h can be determine only three district wavelength of light be found in the visible range they have wavelength of 647 ± 3 nm 482 ± 0.5 nm and 431 ± 0.4 nm these wavelength be found from the gradient of fig 2. multiply by the slit separation d. in order to far analyse this data two assume have to be make firstly the observe light have the same value of p this be valid because change the value of p would incur such a large change in λ that it would cause it to fall out of the visible range secondly that the n value of the observe emit light be consecutive this be valid because there be no intermediate wavelength of light detect it can also be deduce that the long wavelength of light be emit from the low change in energy so must correspond to the small value of n. fig 3. show the cast of λ value on to various series of increase n if the cast be correct then the gradient should the vernier scale use to measure the position of the telescope this scale be part of the mechanism that allows the telescope to rotate about the centre of the spectrometer while the other element stay fix 2. the telescope with focus lens on either side the eye piece at one end allows the user to see though the telescope at the magnify diffraction pattern the crosshair in the centre of the telescope be to be line up onto the centre of the maximum 3. hydrogen lamp connect to a fix power source 4. screw to adjust the size of the light sourc e slit in the back of the collimator increase the width increase the intensity of the maximum line make them easy to distinguish but increase the uncertainty in

a single wavelength travel through the collimator 8. the path the telescope be allow to travel through this cover all the location where observable maximum cause by the diffraction pattern will occur fig 2. the relationship between maximum order and sinθ for each observe wavelength of light which be all show in their respective colour from this λ can be found for each colour use the relationship described in equ 2 .error bar have be omit for the sake of clarity be equal to -r h and the y intercept equal to r h /p 2 a can be see from equ 2 each cast have an associate pcc value which be a measure of how strongly the data fit a linear relationship and a predict value of p which be calculate by combine the gradient and intercept model the value of n to be 3,4 and 5 yield the high pcc value on average 0.16 high than with the other n value the be also the only set of n value that yield an approximately integer value of p found to be 2 to 2sf make the observe emission line part of the balmer series which support this be the with the value of p and n finalise it can be state that the rydberg constant be found to be 1.088 ± 0.007 x10 7 m −1 the uncertainty be estimate by combine the percentage uncertainty of the wavenumber value in quadrature this be comparable to the accepted value of 1.097 x10 7 m −1 which lie just outside of the uncertainty of this report this report be carry out in a darken room with no fluctuate light source such a outside light the body of the hydrogen lamp almost entirely shield the spectrometer opening from background light and the relevant intensity of this ambient light when compare to the intensity of the hydrogen lamp be so much low that it can be consider to be negligible hence any possible interference effect have be ignore in the data analysis while set up the grate spectrometer the angle between the plane of the diffraction grate and the incident light be set to 90 • the possible effect of misalignment have not be take into account because if equ 3 be expand to include this factor then where θ i be the angle between the incident light and the normal to the diffraction grate a it can be see when λ be determine from the gradient of a graph such a fig 2. θ i will only effect the intercept so will have no impact on the result in analysis θ i can therefore be ignore while collect result the hydrogen lamp be only left on for a few second at at time to prevent damage and reduce any possible build up of heat with could effect the data such a by change the refractive index of surround air enough that the wavelength of light be noticeably change cause slight deformation in the optical element due to their expansion under heat or by difference in refractive index be great enough to scatter the light so that the collimator be n't sufficient to make the light ray parallel none parallel light ray would mean that light incident on the diffraction grate would have a range of θ i and in accordance with equ 4 the spectral line would broaden and cause the uncertainty in the location of each maximum to change the experiment be carry out at room temperature however change in ambient heat or other atmospheric condition such a air pressure and humidity which be not quantify during the experiment throughout the experiment could not be control and be not measure hence the magnitude of any possible effect be not know v. conclusion the goal of this experiment be to measure the rydberg constant by invest the spectral emission of hydrogen use a grate spectrometer it be found that in the visible range the emission spectrum of hydrogen contains three separate wavelength which through analysis be determine to be part of the balmer series of spectral line the rydberg constant be found to be 1.088 ± 0.007 x10 7 m −1 in order to more precisely state this much more measurement would need to take and compile to reduce random error additionally a diffraction grate with a much small slit separation would allow many more maximum to be observe and far reduce error in far measurement the effect of change in atmospheric condition should also be investigate such a by take preliminary data at temperature and condition across the range that could be expect to occur during the full experiment to investigate the effect and incorporate them into the state uncertainty with this data it could also be decide if far step to control atmospheric condition should be take",extended,the
59,GS_BOD369_Redacted,a spectrometer be use to analyse the emission spectrum of a sample of hydrogen three spectral line be analyse and rydberg 's constant be measure to be 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 furthermore it be show that the emission be most likely those of the balmer series produce by electron fall to the n=2 state from high energy level a second experiment be also conduct in which a spectrum be produce by a white lead nichia 713-3955 a continuous spectrum be observe and image take in order to discern how the lead produce this and the nature of the spectrum t he most simple quantise model of the atom be the bohr model of hydrogen in which a single electron be consider to orbit a proton bound entirely by the coulomb force 1 in this model we consider the quantise nature of electron energy level such that only distinct and discrete wavelength of electromagnetic radiation can be absorbed or emit by an atom these wavelength be unique to a particular atom or molecule and can therefore be use to identify matter present in object such a star or mixture of gas and theirs property in this way spectrometry can be use to study fundamental interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter in a similar way to in atom lead function by the stimulate movement of electron between artificial energy level within the lead structure such that the electron emit photon 2 thus information on structure of an lead could be discern by perform spectrometry on it emission spectrum figure 1 show how light diffracts through a diffraction grate where the path difference between adjacent beam to any point on the screen be give by dsin θ where d be the distance between adjacent slit and θ be the angle subtend by a diffract ray and the displacement between the grate and the screen for the wave to interfere constructively this path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength λ thus we find the relation where n be the order of the maximum an experimental set up like that in figure 2 be use circle graduate in degree with a minimum angular resolution of 1 arcminute the spectrometer be calibrate by set the telescope cross-hair directly on the open slit with a test bright light source behind it before insert the grate the telescope be rotate at 90 • to the collimator a mirror be insert into the grate turntable and rotate so that light be reflect from the collimator into the telescope at this point the mirror be at 45 • to the light beam the mirror be then replace with the diffraction grate and rotate 45 • to make it perpendicular to the collimator the telescope be then rotate 90 • back to face the collimator the diffraction grate use have 300 line per millimetre a this be the only grate which allow the m red ±2 and m violet ±3 maximum to be easily distinguish but still provide enough visible order such that a mean and error could be calculate measurement be take anticlockwise from the high order maximum on the left to that on the right in order to avoid any mechanical inconsistency that my be present in the device if the direction of rotation be alternate the high order maximum that could be see clearly be m blue 3 and m blue −3 with angle from the central maximum of 25.93 • and −25.08 • respectively in order to maximise precision the slit be close until the maximum furthest from the centre be just visible this meant that the cross-hair be always centre on the fringe reduce the error in the fringe 's position and that adjacent fringe would be less likely to interfere or obscure each other the high order maximum for the red emission line be 2 and -2 a any high order maximum be likely too dim with the slit at a width small enough to provide adequate precision the measure result can be see in table i where the error be determine a the minimum resolution of the spectrometer 1 arcminute instead of half that a the measurement depend on an initial measurement of the location of the central maximum a can be see the angle be symmetric around the central maximum but all positive order of maximum have angle away from the centre that be large than their negative counterpart this would seem to imply that the diffraction grate be not set up perfectly perpendicular to the incident light beam alternatively the actual position of the central maximum could have be measure inaccurately however this seem less likely a the inconsistency be a high a 0.32 • an order of magnitude large than the resolution of the device in the case of m blue ±1 the average wavelength associate with the angle in table i can be see in table ii error be calculate use equation 2 where σ m be the standard error on the mean s be the standard deviation of the value use to calculate the mean and x be the number of value use to calculate the mean the measure wavelength mostly align with those measure for the balmer series of hydrogen emission line on the order of 655nm for red 485nm for blue and 433nm for violet 3 there be a noticeable difference of around 10nm between the measure violet wavelength and the accepted one it could be that whatever error present in the set up which cause the asymmetry in table i be intensified at small wavelength a small difference in slit width and angle will have a large contribution to this small value of λ. the similarity between our measurement and those of the balmer series implies that electron be fall to the n= 2 electron quantum state from the bohr model of the hydrogen atom we find where r h be the rydberg constant for hydrogen n be the low energy electron quantum number and p be the high energy electron quantum number the full derivation of this can be found in appendix a 1 it be interest to note that this equation only describes atom or ion with a single electron a multiple electron will interact with each other however for nucleus with more than one proton the rydberg constant will have a different value scale by the increase in charge of the nucleus a it have be establish that the measure wavelength be most like those of the balmer series then n 2 and p 3 4 5 for the red blue and violet emission line respectively note that the energy level of the emission line must be consecutive else other emission line would be see furthermore a the the energy of the photon be described by where h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light a large difference in energy level corresponds to a small wavelength λ. for each of the wavelength an average value of r h be calculate and can be see in table iii this give an average value of r h of 1.09±0.01×10 7 with all error calculate use equation 2. the accepted value for r h be 1.10 × 10 7 therefore our measure value be in concurrence with this 3 it may be of interest to compare this data to different assumption of the n electron energy level a such the possibility must be consider that n could be high or low than n 2. a can be see the assumption of the n 3 or n 4 state produce line that be quite clearly not horizontal have gradient an order of magnitude large than that of n 1 or n 2. from comparison with other measure value of the balmer series n 2 it be clear that the measure wavelength be those of the balmer series however this be not necessarily clear from the figure 4 a n 1 and n 2 have gradient of similar order of magnitude although the gradient for n 2 be indeed closer to 0 it be not significantly closer furthermore the error in n 1 be significant compare to it value around 35 this be likely due to the afore mention deviation of the violet emission line wavelength form it expect value a such more data would be require to prove that electron be fall to the n 2 state a set up like that in the previous experiment be use see fig 2 with the 300 line per millimetre diffraction grate replace with a 100 line per millimetre grate and a camera use to take image through the eyepiece 4 this be do to allow the entire spectrum to be visible at once a see through the eyepiece so that it could then be photograph and the intensity across wavelength plot a nichia model 713-3955 white lead be use in place of the hydrogen lamp a scan 90 • clockwise and anticlockwise from the central maximum be make to give a qualitative understand of the diffraction pattern interestingly it be observe that the spectrum of the lead be entirely continuous this can be see in figure 5 with no clear vertical line correspond to specific emission line this be entirely contradictory to the idea that this lead work use artificial energy level within the material alone to generate light a a set of energy level span a range must be produce such that the difference in energy between subsequent energy level be small enough to produce a spectrum that appear continuous furthermore each energy level will have a different threshold voltage meaning that one could activate only low energy emission of red light with a sufficiently low voltage this however be not observe and the lead turn on sharply at 2.66 ± 0.005v a such it seem reasonable to assume that the lead itself produce a high energy wavelength for example ultraviolet and this be absorbed by a phosphor coat and re-emitted in the visible range horizontal line can be observe on the spectrum however this be determine to be cause by dust within the slit on the collimator block some of the incident light a far issue exist in that order of maximum high than the first order be see to overlap fig 5. two image be take of the spectrum with the camera centre on the blue region and the red region respectively this be do to hopefully remove some of the camera 's bias towards certain colour or object in certain position the angle away from the central maximum of the red and blue boundary can be see in table v and the intensity plot of each can be see in figure 6 and 7. interestingly it can be see that there be clear saturation of the detect intensity between a distance of 300 and 500 pixel on both figure 6 and 7. the wavelength in this interval correspond to the range 470nm to 520nm this fact alone implies that this camera be unsuitable for this purpose a either the detector or some aspect of it internal processing contains a bias towards certain wavelength in the visible a such in order to conduct this aspect of the experiment effectively an unbiased camera must be found and utilised in this paper a spectrometer be use to analyse the spectrum emit by a hydrogen lamp and a nichia 713-3955 white lead in order to discern a deeper understand of the structure present in each source first the spectrum of hydrogen be analyse and be found to contain three distinct emission line red blue and violet with respective wavelength of 652 ± 3nm 482 ± 11nm and 449 ± 3nm it be found that these wavelength be most similar to those of the hydrogen balmer series with the only measurement deviate from the accepted value be that of the violet measurement this deviation be likely due to asymmetry cause by error in calibration however far data should be take to confirm this from these wavelength measurement the average of rydberg 's constant be calculate to be 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 with the accepted value value be 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 3 far analysis be conduct under the assumption that the emission line see be not those of the balmer series figure 4 and table iv provide the predict value of r h associate with an emission line for a possible value of n. a rydberg 's constant should be the same for all wavelength the gradient of the line should be 0. it be found that the assumption of the n 3 or n 4 state produce line that be quite clearly not horizontal have gradient an order of magnitude large than that of n 1 or n 2. from the calculate gradient table iv it can be see that n 1 and n 2 produce gradient on the same order of magnitude a such more data would have to be collect in order to verify that this be the balmer series the lead spectrum be analyse and qualitatively it be notice that the observe spectrum be continuous contradict the expectation that the lead produce light in a way similar to that of other lead by stimulate movement of electron between distinct energy level a the difference in energy between consecutive energy level would have to be small enough such that it could not be notice this seem like an unlikely design instead it seem more reasonable that the lead be cover by a phosphor coat which absorbs a small set of high energy wavelength and emits a continuous spectrum in the visible an attempt at a more quantitative analysis of the spectrum be make use image take on the camera of an iphone 7 however on far inspection of the data fig 6 and 7 it be see that the camera or processing within the device contain clear bias towards certain wavelength make the data fundamentally untrustworthy for this aspect of the experiment to be conduct successfully it would be necessary to utilise an entirely unbiased light photo-detector or camera mount to the spectrometer telescope to maximise stability the rydberg equation be where r h be the rydberg constant n be the low energy electron quantum number and p be the high energy electron quantum state to derive this we imagine a hydrogen atom in which a single electron be in a circular orbit of radius r of a single proton the total energy e held by the electron can be represent by the sum of it

60,GS_OQP549_Redacted,in the experiment conduct we calculate with an error of three part per thousand the rydberg constant this constant appear in rydberg 's formula and relates the inverse of the wavelength of emit light to the fundamental quantum number of the orbitals involve in the emission we calculate the value of the rydberg constant to be 𝑅 ∞ 1.099 • 10 7 ± 3 • 10 4 𝑚 −1 agree with the accepted value which be to four significant figure 1.097 • 10 7 𝑚 −1 1 to obtain the data necessary for the calculation we use a hydrogen discharge lamp observe it spectrum with an optical spectrometer and measure the angular position of the spectral line of three different colour with respect to the central maximum we then compare the result for the light wavelength obtain by plot the angular position against the order number with the know value for the correspond fundamental quantum number for the hydrogen pectrometry be a non-invasive technique that allows u to determine the chemical composition of an object by study the spectrum of the light it emits to obtain spectrum the light emit be separate into an array of different colour that can be observe use a spectrometer this technique find many research application especially in astronomy the composition of a distant astronomical object can be deduce from it radiation 2 one important relationship in spectrometry be the rydberg formula which express the behaviour of spectral line and be found empirically the constant that appear in the formula also name after rydberg can be express in term of fundamental constant the most general formulation of the relationship be first publish in 1888 by johannes rydberg a swedish physicist who start his career a an amanuensis the theoretical justification of his work be provide in 1913 by niels bohr who propose a model of the atom with electron orbit around the nucleus on quantise energy level 3 bohr 's work show that rydberg 's formula relates the fundamental quantum number of the energy level from and to which an orbit electron drop emit energy in the form of light and the wavelength of the light emit 3 the aim of this experiment be to measure rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer we use a hydrogen gasdischarge lamp a a source of light and register the angular position of the light fringe use an optical spectrometer from these measurement we be able to calculate the wavelength of the different colour of the fringe and therefore obtain a value for the rydberg 's constant a diffraction grate have equally space slit that be parallel and identical to each other and give an interference pattern with very narrow maximum this enables more precise measurement of the angular position of the maximum than could be obtain use a setup with few slit a series of fringe call balmer series can be observe with a spectrometer if a hydrogen lamp be place in front of it grate the band of each colour correspond to the maximum of the diffraction pattern and repeat several time at different angular position identify by an order number m a show in fig 1. the order number the angle θ relative to the position 0 th order at which a fringe can be found and the wavelength of the colour observe be related through the path difference 2 for light of wavelength λ a phase difference between neighbour ray of integer multiple of 2π determines a principal maximum the relationship between the phase difference δϕ and the path difference δx be give by where m be the order number a show in fig 2. the path difference be ∆𝑥 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 2 where d be the separation between the slit of the grate combine equation 1 and 2 it follow that the relationship 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑚𝜆 3 hold 4 the rydberg constant s fig 2. a diagram show the difference in path length δx between two adjacent ray this distance be equal to dsinθ where d be the slit separation and θ be the grate angle a different expression for the wavelength be give by an empirical formula found by the swiss physicist johann balmer in 1855 later generalise by rydberg 5 the more general formulation be where r∞ be the rydberg constant n and p be integer and represent respectively the energy level of the initial and final state of the electron that emits the light the rydberg constant can be express use fundamental constant by look at the energy of the photon that result from the transition of an electron between different energy level in the hydrogen atom a described by bohr 's model the energy of this photon be in absolute value equal to the difference δe in internal energy of the two energy level involve and can be express use einstein 's light quantisation a where h be the planck constant and c be the speed of light in vacuum 6 the difference in internal energy can also be express in term of the energy of initial and final energy level the energy of these state can be write a the sum of their potential energy pe and kinetic energy ke and where e be the charge of the electron r be the radius of the atomic orbit me be the mass of the electron and v be it velocity 5 substitute bohr 's radius and the speed of the orbit electron see equation 11 and 12 in appendix into equation 6 the energy can be express a where n represent the initial energy level similarly the same result can be found for the final energy with p represent the final energy level the difference in internal energy can now be write a equate equation 5 and 10 rydberg 's formula can be write a therefore the rydberg 's constant can be write a the set-up of the spectrometer use in this experiment be show in fig 3. after focus the eyepiece on the crosswire at roughly 30 centimetre to avoid eye strain we focus the camera lens of the optical spectrometer on an object distant nearly 10 metre which be a good approximation of focus on infinity we then position the lamp close to the slit to adjust the focus of the collimator and clamped the telescope at 90° to be able to put the grate at exactly 45° use a mirror for this experiment we use a diffraction grate with 300 slit to minimise systematic error we make sure that all the component be well align use a sodium lamp that unlike the hydrogen lamp do not need to be turn off often to avoid overheat to be able to see the spectrum clearly we kept our desk lamp off for the entire duration of the experiment for the experiment we use a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp a the source of light we turn it off between measurement to avoid overheat we first measure the width of the central maximum a a reference value for the width of the spectral line to be approximately 4 we then take two measurement of angular position relative to the central maximum for each colour band we be able to see position the crosswire approximately on the centre of the fringe the error on these reading due to the difficulty to clearly identify the centre of very dim fringe be estimate to be 1 the error on the reading on the vernier scale of the spectrometer be of 1 we plot the sine of the measure angular position against the order number of the fringe for each of the colour observe red blue and violet we verify that for every colour the relationship between the two variable follow the linear correlation expect a show if fig 4. we be able to see three order of line for the red and blue light but only two for the violet one the three line meet in a common point that corresponds to the central maximum namely the 0 th order the error on the fit line for the three colour show in fig 3 be express in table 1. the error on the single data point be calculate consider the error on the reading on the vernier scale and the estimate error on the position of the centre of the fringe these error on the fitting line be calculate use the covariance matrix use equation 3 in the form where d be the separation between two consecutive slit and we calculate wavelength for the three set of line observe the value obtain for the wavelength and the correspond fundamental quantum number of the initial energy level be set out in table 2. the value for the fundamental quantum number n represent the initial energy level be obtain from the know value correspond to the wavelength measure 1 use equation 4 we calculate a value for the rydberg constant for each of the colour know that the fundamental quantum number p correspond to the energy level to which the electron drop be 2 for the three case 1 take the average of the three value calculate for the constant we obtain our final result of 1.099•10 7 m -1 with an error of 3•10 4 m -1 this error arises from the error calculate on the three individual value that depend on the limitation of the equipment our ability to identify the centre of the line and on the precision of the fit function all the error be determine use the standard formula of error analysis 8 this report review the process involve in calculate rydberg 's constant with small systematic error observe with a spectrometer the spectral line generate by a hydrogen lamp and measure their angular position relative to the central maximum plot these measurement against the order number of the colour band we obtain a value for the wavelength of the different colour use the wavelength value we be able to determine the fundamental quantum number of the orbital involve in the emission of light by compare our result with the know value for the hydrogen atom energy level finally we use rydberg 's formula and obtain a mean value of 1.099•10 7 m -1 for the rydberg constant this result agrees with the accepted value of 1.097•10 7 m -1 1 which lie within our error range to minimise systematic error the alignment of the component of the equipment be carefully set up and the influence of background illumination reduce a much a possible a it cause the line to be difficult to observe other possible source of error we identify be the dimness of high order spectral line the possible defocus of the equipment and random error

61,GS_WSY182_Redacted,an investigation be undertaken with the aim of measure the visible balmer transition wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum in order to deduce an estimate of the rydberg constant r∞ this be do use simple spectrometry the light from a hydrogen lamp be pas through a 300lines/mm diffraction grate and the diffraction angle θ be measure a graph of sin θ against order m allow the wavelength of the first 3 transition to be determine and this in turn allow the rydberg constant r∞ to be measure to a high accuracy and precision the final estimate for the rydberg constant be r∞ 1.097 ± 0.004 10 7 m −1 this be in agreement with the accepted value r∞ 10973731.6m −1 to four significant figure spectrometry of light be arguably the most important technique in all of astronomy without the ability to analyse the incoming light from distant cosmic object it would not be possible to verify the theory of the universe on a large scale spectrometry have help to improve our understand of many area of modern physic for example the formation and structure of star and galaxy the study of earth-like planet and other stellar orbit object and our understand of relativity this report detail an investigative effort into the measurement of rydberg 's constant this be do use a light spectrometer consist of a hydrogen lamp and a collimator which produce a parallel beam of light this beam then pas through a diffraction grate and produce a diffraction pattern this diffraction pattern can be measure by a camera/eyepiece set up which be attach to a freely rotate table the measurement of different colour of light at different diffraction angle allows for the determination of wavelength and hence of the rydberg constant when an electric current be pas through a glass tube which contains low pressure hydrogen gas it emits light consist of various different wavelength 1 when this light be pas through a diffraction grate it be separate into it individual component wavelength which build up an emission spectrum an emission spectrum consists of a few bright colour line against a black backdrop see figure 2 these line correspond to the different wavelength of light emit by the source these wavelength be distinct and demonstrate quantisation in the structure of the atom in fact these wavelength be a result of an electron fall from an excite state to a low energy state figure 1 demonstrates some of these transition in hydrogen the transition demonstrate here belong to the balmer series which consists of the transition from high energy level to the 2nd energy level n=2 when an electron transition from a high energy level to a low one it release energy in the form of a photon the amount of energy carry by this photon be exactly equal to the difference between the two energy level the wavelength of this photon be related to this energy difference by the follow formula where e=transition energy h=planck 's constant 6.626 ... 10 −34 j c=speed of light in a vacuum 2.997 ... 10 8 m −1 and λ=wavelength of light emit the transition wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum be also give by equation 1 below here rather than require the energy difference between the two energy state the quantum number of the initial state and the final state be need this property make the equation incredibly powerful and work extremely well for hydrogen 's emission spectrum but can also be use for some large atom the constant in this equation be call the rydberg constant where λ wavelength n initial state of excite electron p final state of de-excited electron and r ∞ the rydberg constant the visible wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum the balmer series wavelength can be predict by set the final energy level p 2 and the initial energy level n 3 4 5 .... the first three balmer transition spectral line can be see in figure 2 below along with the expect wavelength energy level to the 2nd energy level these wavelength be in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to measure the rydberg constant via equation 1 the wavelength of each spectral line be need in order to measure these wavelength a light spectrometer be use this spectrometer consist of 4 main component a hydrogen lamp act a a light source the light from the hydrogen lamp be pas through a slit and a collimator in series to produce a parallel thin beam of light this thin beam be pas through a 300lines/mm diffraction grate in order to separate the light into it component wavelength a camera/eyepiece set up sat on table which be free to rotate about a vertical axis that pas through the centre of the diffraction grate by rotate the camera/eyepiece the angle θ between the central maximum and increase order maximum of different colour be measure the rotate table be fit with a vernier scale which allow the measurement of this angle θ to arcminute precision within 1/60 of a degree a simple schematic of the set up can be see in figure 3 below simple diffraction theory state that different wavelength be diffract by different amount when pas through the diffraction grate this be the reason that the component wavelength be split up to produce an emission spectrum like the one demonstrate in figure 2. the angle θ by which a particular wavelength be diffract be related to the wavelength by the follow equation where m=order of maximum λ=wavelength d=grating space and θ=diffraction angle this meant that plot a graph of sin θ against the order m result in a straight line with the gradient equal to λ d therefore by use this simple set up and measure the diffraction angle at increase order maximum for the various different colour it be possible to measure the wavelength of each of those colour and hence calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ via equation 1 the hydrogen lamp use provide a stable light source from which the emission spectrum of hydrogen could be investigate the dependent variable be the angle θ between the central maximum and the m'th maximum for each colour of light observe red blue and violet preliminary measurement reveal that the vernier scale on the rotate table be sometimes difficult to read exactly a it be n't always obvious which line on the scale be align perfectly also whilst each spectral line be relatively thin there be some uncertainty in the position of it center it be decide that to compensate for these two source of error an uncertainty of ±5 arcsecond be appropriate in each measure value of the angle θ. this be still a small percentage uncertainty in the order of 0.5 or less meaning that the precision be still high by plot graph of sin θ against m the wavelength of each colour be estimate by refer back to equation 2 it can be see that λ measure d gradient this be consistent with the data collect a the red line have the great gradient whilst the violet line have the small see figure 4 use this relation and the value of d 1/300000 m an estimate for the wavelength of each observe spectral line be calculate the uncertainty in the gradient of each line be extract from the the respective covariant matrix this carry forward the ±5 arcsecond error estimate earlier into an uncertainty in the value of the gradient since d 1/300000 m be constant the measure wavelength λ be only dependent on the gradient it can be easily verify use quadrature that the percentage uncertainty in λ be equal to the percentage uncertainty in the gradient use a rearrange form of equation 1 allow the calculation of the rydberg constant r ∞ from each of the three observe spectral line in this case p 2 and n 3 4 5 for the red blue and violet line respectively since p and n be definite and without error the rydberg constant have an uncertainty which depend only on λ. that uncertainty could be easily calculate in quadrature to be equal to the percentage uncertainty in the value of λ. the result from the first three wavelength in the emission spectrum of hydrogen can be see in table 1 below from these result an average value of the rydberg constant r ∞ be calculate along with it associate uncertainty use quadrature this final estimate in the value of the rydberg constant be this result be very accurate agree with the accepted value r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 to four significant figure the percentage uncertainty in the final estimate be just 0.36 which show that the result colour λ/nm r ∞ 10 7 m −1 red 656 ± 5 1.098 ± 0.009 blue 485 ± 3 1.100 ± 0.007 violet 436 ± 2 1.092 ± 0.005 table 1 a table show the measure wavelength λ and the correspond value of the rydberg constant r∞ from these result an average value of r∞ be calculate along with it associate uncertainty use quadrature be also very precise all in all this demonstrates that a very simple spectrometer set up can be use to make high precision measurement to far improve the precision of this experiment one could take more time to collect repeat result of the angle θ observe for each spectral line and hence reduce the uncertainty in the measure angle this would propagate into a small uncertainty in the gradient and hence a small uncertainty in the final estimate of r ∞ this would result in a more precise measurement accurate to a great number of significant figure furthermore one could change the diffraction grate use to collect data for different value of the grate space d. do this several time would allow the wavelength of each spectral line to be calculate multiple time and hence an average wavelength could be calculate for each spectral line which would reduce the standard error on the wavelength and propagate into a small error in the final estimate of r ∞ another possible improvement lie in the fact that background light from desk lamp and computer screen make it difficult to see any maximum beyond m ±3 it would be possible to reduce the background light to zero by conduct the experiment in a photographic darkroom and turn off all light source include desk lamp and computer screen during measurement take this would allow data to be take for higher-order maximum which would in turn allow a high number of data point in the sin θ vs. m graph in turn the uncertainty in the gradient would be reduce and hence result in a more precise estimate of r ∞ the reduction in background light could also allow the measurement of low wavelength spectral line by go beyond the first three balmer series transition and substitute n 6 into equation 1 it can be see that there should be a far violet colour spectral line of wavelength λ 410nm in the initial investigation this spectral line be not visible probably due to low intensity and too much background light however this wavelength still lie within the visible spectrum and hence technically it could be observe use the same equipment 4 this would allow an extra value of the rydberg constant to be measure and would allow the calculation of an average use a great number of measurement reduce the standard error on the mean value of r ∞ and increase the ultimate precision lastly the error on the angle θ measure at each maximum could be reduce by use a rotate table with a digital scale rather than the analogue vernier scale on the exist table this would greatly reduce the previously estimate uncertainty of ±5 arcsecond and hence reduce the error which be propagate into the final result again this would lead to a more precise value of r ∞ the aim of this investigation be to gain an estimate for the rydberg constant r ∞ use simple spectrometry of light this aim be successfully met and the rydberg constant be measure to be r ∞ 1.097 ± 0.004 10 7 m −1 this agree with the accepted value of r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 to four significant figure demonstrate the high accuracy and precision of the method involve with some minor tweak and more time the method could be improve to reduce uncertainty in turn this would lead to an increase the precision of the experiment and allow the measurement of the rydberg constant to a great number of significant figure,superficial,bal

63,GS_ICG798_Redacted,we experimentally determine the rydberg constant to the same order of magnitude a the accepted value the constant be found by use the technique of spectroscopy on hydrogen a spectrometer partner with a diffraction grate be use to observe the hydrogen emission spectrum the angle of diffraction for the different colour line be calculate with a high precision scale hence the error be small the data reading for the violet emission line be inaccurate whilst red and turquoise agree with the theory for both wavelength and the rydberg constant have the same order of magnitude t he swedish physicist johannes rydberg devise the rydberg formula in 1888 to explain the observe feature of atomic spectrum 1 from this formula arose the fundamental physical constant-the rydberg constant-as for each emission spectrum he study the constant in the formula stayed the same 1 what make the rydberg constant special be that it can be define in term of other fundamental constant a will be show in equation 3 the rydberg constant can be use to work out the wavelength of an emit photon in an element from a certain energy level hence it be use in spectroscopy and have played a major role in atomic physic 2 spectroscopy have many application in modern astronomy such a obtain data about the composition density and temperature of a certain astronomical object 3 spectroscopy have be significant in the improvement of our knowledge about the solar system for this experiment the light emit from the hydrogen lamp be separate by a diffraction grate where the apparatus the light travel through be call the spectrometer the main apparatus use for this experiment be the spectrometer show in fig 1. it work by have a light source 's ray travel through an adjustable narrow slit follow by a collimator to make the ray parallel 4 the light then pas through the diffraction grate to disperse the light into distinct spectral line observe through the eyepiece a first postulate by niels bohr the emission spectrum observe be compose of distinct line since the different colour of light have different wavelength and so be diffract different amount 1 they have different wavelength a inside the atom after an electron have be excite it fall down from a discrete energy level give off a photon of discrete energy depend on the level transition 1 the combination of photon emit from different level combination form the emit light detailed draw of a spectrometer that consists of a collimator grate table and telescope it show how the light be collimate diffract and then focus the grate table can rotate a well a the telescope so that the angle between the grate and telescope can be measure the angle be measure by a vernier scale on the grate table 4 the spectrometer can be use to find the wavelength of the different colour of light observe by the relation of wavelength λ and angle of diffraction θ in the grate equation 4 1 the path difference d sin θ of the light can be calculate from fig 2 show the slit separation d in the diffraction grate and how the angle be define constructive interference between neighbour light ray occurs at point where whole wavelength meet so at a phase difference of 2πm where m be an integer multiple also refer to a the order the phase difference path difference × 2π λ 5 so combine this with the definition of the path difference we get 1 the wavelength calculate in 1 can be use in the rydberg formula 6 to calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ in equation 2 4 the spectrometer be set up a show in fig 1 with the `` source `` be a hydrogen lamp the slit be adjustable in width and the diffraction grate have the space 78.8 line per mm importantly there be also a crosshair on the telescope allow the observe line to be measure accurately to begin we align and focus the spectrometer by complete the follow step we make sure the telescope align with the collimator sharpen the image of the slit and make the crosshair align with it from this alignment we rotate the telescope exactly 90 • with the use of the highly precise vernier scale which use arc minute to measure the angle between the diffraction grate and telescope the high accuracy of the scale meant the uncertainty on any rotation be ±5 arc minute which approximates to ±0.08 • the rotation meant an accurate measurement of 45 • between the grate and incident beam could be found by align the grate so that the slit image fell on the crosshair finally the grate be rotate back 45 • to make sure the grate be set to 0 • incidence angle with the spectrometer calibrate we then measure the angle of diffraction from the central spectral line for the four observe colour in the hydrogen emission spectrum the central line have order m 0 so we take reading with increase order to one side of the line and decrease order to the other we take reading of the angle a a function of m for nine order four on each side and repeat the next set of result with a different observer my lab partner in order to reduce the subjective random error throughout the experiment we make sure to switch off the hydrogen lamp between reading in order to reduce the risk of it overheat despite this for the first lab session our lamp seem very hot we think that this along with our lamp be less intense in the colour magenta result in u not be able to see the blue and violet emission line for this first set of result due to the weaker lamp light it be also harder to see the crosshair and thus accurately align the emission lines-increasing the uncertainty for the second set of data reading the lamp be more intense in colour which meant we could take reading for three colour rather than two with the crosshair also be more visible plot the order m against the sine of the angle in radian give the graph in fig 3. the measure angle have to first be process by take the m 0 angle a zero thus subtract this value from the other angle and then convert the angle to radian a see in fig 3 we be unable to get reading fig 3. graph show the plot of order m against the sin of the angle for the three different colour wavelength red turquoise violet in the graph the red emission line produce the steepest gradient follow by the violet and then turquoise for the blue colour line in hydrogen 's emission spectrum n 5 the line of this colour be too faint to be observe even if we increase the slit width to allow more light through the error bar on the graph be very small not encompass the line of best fit for the respective wavelength our error be found by standard error propagation of sin θ. hence we be not quite sure why they be so small however we think it could be due to the high precision of the equipment a predict by theory in 1 we obtain straight line for each wavelength in the graph and they all cross around the point 0 0 the value of the gradient equal their respective wavelength multiply by the slit separation where the slit separation be 1mm/78.8 line and the uncertainty on the wavelength be calculate from the uncertainty in the gradient table show that the red and turquoise wavelength be both in the same order of magnitude a their accepted wavelength however the range of their uncertainty do n't include these value this again show how the calculate uncertainty be small than they should have be with such precise equipment we estimate our error in subjectivity by find the error in our observe line width the large value of the error on the line width and the half range of our data reading be take for error propagation our value for the wavelength of the violet light be highly inaccurate this be show by the violet wavelength be calculate a longer than the turquoise wavelength and in fig 3 it have a steeper gradient than turquoise the order of gradient steepness should have be red turquoise violet this inaccuracy of the violet wavelength make it hard to calculate the rydberg constant from rearrange 2 to plot 1 λ against 1 n 2 a a result of the inaccuracy there be no clear straight line relationship in fig 4 thus the gradient of the negative rydberg constant be not able to be calculate accurately if only the data for the turquoise and red spectrum line be use the rydberg constant be calculate a 1 × 10 7 m −1 show how these colour be more accurate a this agree with the accepted value to one significant figure naturally use two point for a line of best fit be not very reliable hence it be unfortunate that we be unable to get reading for the dark blue line to increase the accuracy of the line in fig 4. there be also not the possibility to work out the error on the line of best fit a the covariant matrix need more data point to find the rydberg constant we therefore found the r ∞ for each wavelength individually and then take the average we decide to include the value for the constant calculate with the violet data a we be not sure of the main error on it the error on the constant be calculate by standard error propagation our experimentally determine rydberg constant be calculate a with the same order of magnitude a the accepted value in 4 despite the error in our violet wavelength again the error here be very small thus not include the accepted value within the error limit we believe that the error in our violet line reading be not due to external condition such a temperature air pressure or humidity a this would have be the case for all line colour they could however have contribute a a systematic error to all wavelength since they be longer than theory we think the violet line reading could have be inaccurate due to the line become defocussed or the colour of the line not be clear enough to distinguish properly for this colour when conduct the experiment it be at time not clear if the line be the strongly define line suppose to be measure rather than a faint blue line or background colour our inaccurate measurement could also have be cause by the hydrogen lamp a it have a weaker pigment colour emit in comparison to other lamp the defocus could have occur when the the slit width be adjust to allow more light in this experiment aim to determine the rydberg constant by examine the emission spectrum of hydrogen it be conduct by the use of a spectrometer where the light from the hydrogen lamp travel through a diffraction grate the data for the angle of diffraction against order for the three observe colour be process to find the rydberg constant via the grate equation and rydberg formula our result be within the same magnitude of order a the accepted value for the constant we have a very small error on our data which meant it range do not include the accepted constant value our value for the violet wavelength be inaccurate and we be unable to take reading for the dark blue emission line a they be too faint we learnt how to use the vernier scale for the high accurate measurement of angle and how to set up the spectrometer to improve the experiment i would conduct it in a completely dark room without other people present so that their desk lamp would not affect my reading and to improve my chance of see the dark blue emission line i would also repeat the experiment more time to improve my statistical,extended,the
64,GS_YMJ516_Redacted,spectrometry be the science of study the emission and absorption spectrum of object the application of spectrometry range from determine the composition of a star to medical image the reason spectrometry can be use to determine the composition of a star be that each element emits a characteristic spectrum that can be extract from a more complicate spectrum such a that of a blackbody hydrogen when excite emits a line spectrum of discrete wavelength one series of these line be the balmer series which contains all transition to the n 2 energy level from high energy level much of this series be in the visible region of electromagnetic radiation so it can be observe by eye with a spectrometer by find the angular position of the maximum of the spectrum and make use of the grate equation it be possible to calculate accurate value for the wavelength of photon emit when electron fall to the n 2 state with these wavelength a graph can be plot make use of the rydberg equation from which a value for the rydberg constant can be found the rydberg constant be interest in that it can be describe a a combination of other more fundamental constant a good method for properly observe the spectrum of hydrogen be to have it ionise in a gas discharge lamp and then reading the line spectrum emit by the lamp splitting the line which make up the spectrum by use a diffraction grate spectrometer be highly accurate device and a such this method for investigate the rydberg constant can produce very accurate result a long a error be properly account for in the rutherford-bohr model of the atom 1 electron orbit the nucleus in discrete trajectory or energy level if a bound electron be provide with a specific amount of energy it will be excite to a high energy level the electron will then fall to a low energy level and a photon of discrete energy equal to the difference in the two energy level will be emit from the atom 1 while this model do n't well explain feature like the relative intensity of spectral line it do well explain the discrete wavelength of emit photon so it 's sufficient for this investigation grate spectrometer this effect can be observe in a gas by excite the electron of the gas and then use a diffraction grate to split the emit radiation into it constituent wavelength once the radiation have be diffract the angular position θ of the m th maximum where diffract ray interfere constructively for the wavelength λ be determine by 𝑚𝜆 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 1 for a diffraction grate with a line space of d metre transition wavelength for hydrogen can also be calculate use the rydberg equation where r∞ be the rydberg constant with a value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 1 n be the initial energy state of the excite electron and p be it final energy state here the medium that the radiation propagates through be approximate to a vacuum and the mass of the hydrogen nucleus be approximate to infinity in comparison to that of an electron a indicate by the symbol for the rydberg constant 2 the balmer series of transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by 2 with p 2 n 2 and n ϵ z. the first 6 of these wavelength be formally within the visible spectrum 3 method before measurement could be take the spectrometer be calibrate this involve first focus the eyepiece lens on the crosshair and then focus the crosshair onto a distant object while this should have be an object 'at infinity since the object be observe be on the atomic scale focus on a ruler 10 m away be sufficient the telescope camera and eyepiece lens be then align with the collimator without a diffraction grate in place and the collimator be focus onto a sodium gas-discharge lamp these lamp function by use an electric field to accelerate excite gas cation into noble gas atom which result in the cation gain an electron that then fall to a low energy level emit a photon of discrete energy it be this phenomenon that creates the balmer series which be be analyse there be another phenomenon that contributes to the emission spectrum of the gas which be incandescence this phenomenon have a great effect at high temperature and since the lamp operates at a high current this heating effect will be more significant the longer the lamp be operate for this reason the hydrogen lamp be not use to calibrate the spectrometer use the vernier scale on the spectrometer which have a resolution of 1 4 and be divide into third of a degree the telescope be rotate though 90º a grate of 78.8 line per mm 5 be then place in the holder vertically to ensure that the emission line would all be on the line swept out by the rotate telescope the grate be rotate through 45° and the height of the grate table be alter so that the sodium lamp 's central maximum be precisely at the crosshair with this do the grate be rotate back through 45° and the telescope be align back in line with the collimator the sodium lamp be then replace with the hydrogen lamp and measurement be take the angular position of the zero th order maximum be record a 135.43º all the follow maximum be measure relative to this zero point to find the angular position θ of the spectral line the grate be first observe directly to find the rough position of the line to where move use the fine adjustment knob to exactly align the emission line with the crosshair the angle be measure use the vernier scale with two independent measurement from two different observer this reduces the uncertainty in the angular position a the mean of the two point be take also the scale be read from above to avoid parallax error in the angle when the balmer series be observe emission line of colour red aqua and blue could be see for each colour the position of multiple maximum be record include negative maximum on the other side of the zero point this meant in total 6 maximum be record for the red aqua and blue wavelength every 6 measurement the lamp be turn off to cool and reduce it incandescence this ensure that the spectral line remain sharp with these measurement take mean value of each wavelength be calculate use the grate equation 1 and use 2 they be plot on a graph to determine a value for 𝑅 ∞ to verify that the data agrees with 1 the sine of the mean angular position of each maximum be plot against the maximum 's order the resolution of the vernier scale be 𝜋 10800 rad and measurement be take over 6 maximum where each measurement be repeat twice independently this result in the uncertainty σθ ± 2.42 × 10 −5 rad from this the uncertainty in each wavelength can be found a the uncertainty in the grate space can be assume to be negligible these wavelength be then use to plot figure 4 analysis of figure 4 provide a value of 1.099 ± 0.044 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 for the rydberg constant the accepted value of 1.097× 10 7 m -1 5 lie within this range which mean that the data be consistent with both the grate equation 1 and the rydberg equation 2 one potential source of error be the humidity of the air a discus 2 be dependent on the assumption that the medium between the source and the observer can be approximate to a vacuum however when the experiment be conduct the room be especially humid and warm which could well have interfere with the spectrum emit from the hydrogen lamp affect the result of the experiment additionally the balmer series of hydrogen include more discrete wavelength than the three measure in this investigation these other wavelength be in the upper band of the visible region verge on ultraviolet radiation which mean they will have be difficult to observe with the naked eye collect data for these line spectrum may well have lead to a more accurate value for 𝑅 ∞ another way uncertainty could have be reduce be if more than the first 3 maximum have be observable for the wavelength see they be likely invisible because their low intensity meant that the background light of the lab or the incandescence effect drown them out the aim of this investigation be to calculate a value for the rydberg constant the method use involve find the angular position of the maximum of multiple colour of the line spectrum of hydrogen a view through a grate spectrometer use the rydberg equation 2 to calculate 𝑅 ∞ the calculate value be 1.099 × 10 7 ± 0.044 𝑚 −1 which agrees with the model described by 2 this experiment could provide even more accurate value for the rydberg constant in a dry cool environment where many more reading be take with different equipment it would be possible to study the spectrum outside of the visible range which would provide more data to be analyse,superficial,the
65,GS_BMS328_Redacted,where r be the rydberg constant and be approximately equal to 1.097x10 7 m -1 and n1 and n2 be integer value and be equivalent to the initial and final state the rydberg constant can also be express a r ømc 2h where ø be the fine structure constant a dimensionless quantity 6 m be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be plank 's constant another important piece of theory to consider be the balmer series the balmer series be a series of line from the hydrogen emission spectrum cause by electron fall from the nth energy level to the principle quantum number 2 7 for instance the transition from energy level 3 to energy level 2 will appear red on the em spectrum 4- 2 will appear cyan in colour and transition 5- 2 will appear blue 8 use the balmer series therefore allows u to optically record and measure the diffraction scatter a 4 of the transition of n appear in the visible spectrum figure 2 illustrates different type of emission and absorption series include the balmer series it be clear to see that those transition in the lyman series will need considerably more energy to be able to transition to the other n band all the line in the lyman series be in the ultraviolet band and thus be not suitable for our investigation 10 the other series adjacent to the balmer series be the paschen series these transition will have less energy than the balmer transition and thus all the paschen line lie in the infrared band 11 a you move through the series the rate at which the wavelength increase decrease until you reach the convergence limit of the series this be in effect the energy need to ionize the hydrogen atom the figure below illustrates the most important part of the set up two type of discharge lamp be use in this investigation be compose of hydrogen and sodium the sodium lamp be use for the calibration of the spectrometer whereas the hydrogen lamp be use for the actual record the sodium lamp initially emit lilac light and then turn to an orange colour the hydrogen lamp use in this experiment produce a lot of heat which would significantly affect the operation time thus the hydrogen lamp be only use for the record whereas the sodium lamp could operate for long period of time this become one of the key consideration a all measurement would have to be take before the lamp overheat this would require an efficient way of record result after the source we have the slit ideally the slit should be a narrow a possible to make the angle measurement a precise a possible another part of the fix spectrometer be the collimator a collimator essentially produce a beam of parallel ray which be useful for when you want the wave to converge on the same focal point the grate use in this investigation have 300 line per mm the logic behind use a diffraction grate with more slit be the fact that these extra slit would reinforce the diffraction pattern make them more visible especially at the high order 13 the set up of the spectrometer be a lengthy one however this get easy over time the set up begin with the focus of the eyepiece on the crosswire this be do from about 5 meter ideally this should be do from an infinite distance 14 in this case a lamp on the other desk be focus on one consideration be to keep both eye open whilst focus the camera now the telescope have to be align with the axis of the collimator this could be do by very slightly opening the slit with the sodium lamp fully lit behind it now once the collimator be perfectly align with the telescope use the slow-motion drive on the side of the spectrometer stage the collimator be focus until a sharp image appear the cross wire be rotate by π 4 to ensue that the alignment of the stage could be a precise a possible carefully record the angle at which the main stage be rotate and the angle present on the two main scale be an essential part of the experiment a precision be require the main stage be initially move to an angle of 59.5 degree and 2 arc minute two arc minute be the equivalent of .03 of a degree it become essential to be able to quickly convert these reading of arc minute into the more useful degree now the telescope have to be move through exactly 90 degree it be very helpful to get a second opinion on the angle measurement and reach a consensus then the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit on the grate come from the collimator be see this should be at 45 degree to the normal of the spectrometer additionally the use of a mirror to double check the reflection from the collimator prove very useful the reading on the scale must be take down in the case of our set up the reading come out a 68 degree and 20 arc minute now the grate stage must be firmly fix to the main fine motor and this whole set up be move through 45 degree so that the grate be at the normal incidence when the grate stage be in place the grate stage can be move by turn 3 different screw which adjust the height of the main stage to ensure that when move through the angle of 6 figure 2 9 figure 3 12 observation all spectral line can be observe this can be checked by simply observe the spectral line through large angle of incidence and adjust appropriately in a more practical sense the stage be control by 3 screw a it be the most stable configuration a mathematically 3 point determine a plane so any more or less than this would be much less stable 15 when the camera and eye piece be move to the zero order the angular scale read 203 degree and 10 arc minute now the sodium lamp could be replace by the hydrogen lamp and data be record a range of 4 th to -4 th order be measure a a large spread of data would give the best possible set of data in addition to this a second opinion be always utilized a this would give a value of uncertainty value for 3 discrete wavelength emission be record and with these a graph of sinθ against order be plot from the gradient of this straight line plot a value for λ can be obtain the error bar on these graph come from the difference in the two measurement take of the same emission line an error of the gradient can also be show on python with this information and the understand of which wavelength be cause by which transmission the value obtain can be substitute into equation 5 with n1=2 to find the rydberg constant error bar be very small with only reading from the -2 nd 1 st and 2 nd order have an associate error this mean that both measurement from two different people be the same for most record result with this transition the uncertainty of the slope be slightly high than expect due to a minor spread in result at the -1 st and 3 rd order the straight line be expect to pa through the origin and the fact that the error do not cover the actual intercept record must mean an unknown source of error the uncertainty in the slope be considerably small than transition 3 to 2 and simply from observation all the point lie very close to the line once again the line almost pas through the origin and lie outside of the calculate error error bar on this graph be large for order -3 -1 and 2. uncertainty for the slope be even high than for the transition from 3 to 2. the most obvious thing about this plot be the fact that only +/-2 order be measure this be because the intensity of these order be too low to be measure use the human eye also notice that the error bar increase in size a the order increase this could be due to the change in intensity make any kind of measurement subjective if more than one person be use to record the angle once again the line of best fit almost pas through the origin this could be down to systematic error for which there be plenty in this experiment with this information the rydberg constant can be calculate for all 3 transition v. analysis and error from the data 2 of the 3 calculate value give a value for the rydberg constant that lay within the associate error those be the one obtain from the red and blue transition the value associate with the cyan transition have such a small calculate error that it do not pa through the actual value for the rydberg constant a the line be so uniform and without blemish the error must be systematic now if a mean of all 3 value be take you find it give a value of 1.11x10 7 if the actual value of the rydberg constant be give to be 1.097x10 7 then the associate percentage error be 1.19 the standard deviation between all 3 value be 1.34x10 5 which give a standard error of +/-77365 this once again lie outside of the range of the actual value if transition 4 to 2 be take away and just the other two be consider we get a mean of 1.097x10 7 of course more than two piece of information be need to be able to establish a constant of some sort however this be still encourage it be clear to see that systematic error come into play when the cyan spectrum band be measure one possibility be that since background light be all around during the procedure it be entirely possible that background spectral line be measure and record instead of the one from the hydrogen emission spectrum lightbulb produce a continuous spectrum a continuous spectrum be one which all wavelength be present and there be no gap 16 alternatively the error could 've come from a misalignment of the spectrometer for all three of these discrete transition wavelength the set up be realign and return to the central maximum at the normal to the grate it be entirely possible that during the reset of the spectrometer the diffraction grate may have move within the slide or the grate stage may have move to some degree the fact that this transition be measure last may suggest why this be the only graph affected by such systematic error general source of error be hugely dependent on the quality of the set up for instance the dimension of the slit when measure the emission line work two way one way be to keep the slit a narrow a possible and get result with optimum precision but fail to measure the high order which lack intensity or keep the slit slightly wider which would reduce the precision however a well spread of result would be obtain in the case of this set up the slit be left a little bit wider so that for at least two of the line 4 order could be measure it be impossible to say what uncertainty this compromise have however it be most likely very small and can be ignore another possible source could be from the measurement of angle whilst calibrate the instrument each time an angle be measure it have an uncertainty of +/-0.0083 degree now throughout the set up the angle be measure 3 time not include the actual measurement if add in quadrature this lead to an error of +/-0.014 degree this may sound small but it be the equivalent of almost a whole arc minute in addition the measurement of an angle have 2 angle uncertainty so in total that give an angle uncertainty of +/-0.019 degree this be a very small uncertainty equivalent to just over 1 arc minute this assumes that every measurement be take to the near arc minute whereas on occasion a second opinion can give a completely different measurement over all of the measurement take it be found that the average uncertainty a a result of disagreement be 0.28 of an arc minute this be a surprisingly low uncertainty for angle measurement if we take this alone other uncertainty be difficult to calculate a they be either assumption or they be too difficult to compute without specialist equipment in conclusion despite the fact that the value obtain lie outside of the predict uncertainty this set up and experiment should be deem a a successful one due to the fact that a good value be obtain and a very slight unaccountable systematic error be so frequent for this kind of set up the error calculate must be below the true error of the experiment the fact that a percentage error of only 1.19 be obtain show the success and the validity of the experiment even though a slightly low percentage difference be expect due to the sophistication of the instrument it can still be say that the rydberg constant be calculate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and this be especially the case for transition 3 to 2 and 5 to 2 a the rydberg constant lie within their error range a. transition,extended,bal
66,GS_QFQ712_Redacted,"this experiment be carry out to measure the spectrum of hydrogen and use the data to deduce the rydberg constant a well a investigate the resolution of a grate spectrometer the experimental method use be measure the angel between maximum of different order to calculate wavelength of spectral line for different colour and hence calculate the rydberg constant the experimental value be r∞ 10819294.13±82184.5m −1 which have an 1.4 uncertainty compare to the accepted value t he study of spectroscopy date back to 1600s when isaac newton discover the spectrum of visible light by focus a light beam through glass slit and observe rainbow a spectrometer be an instrument use in spectrometric analysis which be make up of specialise piece of equipment the setup of the spectrometer be show in fig 1. in the case of light source the spectrum have three form hot object such a filament emits continuous spectrum where the intensity be a slowly vary function of wavelength an emission spectrum occurs when atom or molecule be excite in hot gas emit extra light with certain wavelength cause well-defined bright line to appear in the spectrum an absorption spectrum appear a dark line in continuous spectrum and be cause by continuous spectrum go through cool gas and the atom or molecule absorb certain value of wavelength the latter two kind of spectrum can give information of temperature or density of the gas 1 in this experiment the balmer series which be the visible part in hydrogen emission spectrum be observe 2 spectroscopy be one of the most power tool for the study of plasma star structure of chemical for example in astronomy we can use the unique spectrum to identify the chemical makeup of object in space or measure the temperature and velocity of space object the rydberg constant be introduce in bohr 's model which explains the atomic spectrum of hydrogen a well a various other atom and ion 3 it be not perfectly accurate but historically played an important role in the development of quantum mechanic and it be a good approximation for hydrogen atom the diffraction grate u the principle of interference to separate spectrum into different color the grate can be consider a a large number of n narrow slit of equal space with separation d. for light of wavelength λ a principal maximum occurs when the neighbor ray have constructive interference which mean the phase difference between them be an integer multiple m of 2π the path difference be dsin θ a see in fig 2 therefore which show where m be the order number on the interference pattern and θ be the angel between specific order and zero order by plot a graph of m against sin θ for a know d a graph of straight line passing through the origin would be produce and we can therefore obtain the value of wavelength from the gradient the resolve power r of a grate be a measure of it ability to separate adjacent spectral line of average wavelength λ 4 it be usually express a the dimensionless quantity a show in fig 3 with n slit the first minimum occurs at a phase angle which be the phase difference add the angel base on number of slit the resolve power can be found use the criterion that the maximum of one diffraction pattern be at the same position a the minimum of another pattern a show in fig 4 fig 4. diffraction pattern of λ1 λ2 and the resolution.the λ here be the minimum distance which can be distinguish by eye and would act a a source of uncertainty 2 the relationship between two wavelength be λ 2 λ − λ which accord to equation 2 give a phase difference 2π λ2 × d sin θ. this will give a minimum value if combine equation 3 and 7 we find base on definition λ 2 λ− λ where λ λ the equation can be rearrange where the left hand side of the equation give the resolve power of spectrometer at this separation the two line can be easily see to be separate since the intensity at a point half way between two equal line be 20 less than the peak 2 to find the value of the rydberg constant the formula of transition wavelength in hydrogen be use where n and n be integer which represent the high energy level and low energy level respectively 3 .in balmer series in hydrogen n'=2 and n=3,4,5 correspond to red blue and violet line of the visible spectrum.fig 5 show the transition of electron in a hydrogen atom λ be the transition wavelength which can be obtain from equation 3 .r ∞ be the rydberg constant which have an accepted value of 10973731.56851m −1 6 fig 5. representation of the transition in a hydrofen atom where balmer trainsitions be at n'=2 7 a more fundamental form explain in the bohr model can be express a where m e be the mass of the electron c be the speed of light h be the plank 's constant and 0 be electrical field permittivity of free space the spectrometer be set up a below procedure to make sure the instrument be properly align and focused.we firstly focus the eyepiece on the cross-hair `` x `` with both eye open and then focus the camera lens so that an object which be approximately 10 meter away be focus on the cross line the telescope eyepiece and camera lens be make align with the collimator and than the focus of the collimator be adjust with the sodium lamp illuminate until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire we then do the follow to make sure the light be at normal incidence so the measure angle be not affected by misalignment.the telescope be rotate precisely 90 degree with the aid of the scale a mirror be put on on the holder and grate table be turn until we just saw a reflect image at the cross-line in the eyepiece which mean the grate be at 45 degree to the incident beam.the grate be then rotate 45 degree precisely use the scale and light be at normal incidence the spectrometer can obtain precise measurement if set up properly with a precision about ± 0.2nm for yellow orange light 2 also the reading would be a precise a 1 60 degree for the measurement of spectrometer resolution the 7 th order of the sodium source be observe we reduce the effective number of grate line by gradually slide two piece of parallel card which be put in front of the grate until we could just resolve the two line of the yellow doublet.the width of space between two card be measure use vernier caliper which have an uncertainty ±0.1mm from the center and multiple measurement be take to calculate the mean and standard deviation the measurement be take by two person individually and the average be calculate to minimize random error while take readings.six set of measurement be take in total for red blue and violet line in the hydrogen spectrum and measurement for each color be repeat once.the result be then analyze in python accord to equation 3 where the gradient of the graph be equal to d λ the associate graph be show in fig 6. fig 6. graph of order against sin θ for different color.linear relation between the order and sin θ be show which be correct accord to equation 3 the gradient of each graph be then calculate use python.the result of the wavelength and it uncertainty be show in table .1. the accepted value for balmer series for n= 3,4,5 which corresponds to red blue and violet in this experiment and their wavelength be 656.3nm,486.1nm and 434.0nm respectively 8 .this give the experimental value for wavelength of uncertainty 1.31 1.54 1.25 1.87 1.06 and 14.6 which be quite accurate except the second measurement of violet line nevertheless a show in fig 6 the graph for the second measurement of violet fail to match a straight line this indicates systematic error in the measurement take therefore this set of data would not be use to obtain the rydberg constant the uncertainty of 1 λ be give by where k be the gradient of the graph and d be the grate space which be equal to 3.3840947546531303×10 −6 m for 300 line per mm grate and 1.269035532994924×10 −5 m for 80 line per mm grate and the uncertainty of the experimental value of rydberg constant be simply give by which be why the uncertainty of 1 λ be calculate instead of λ previously then the value of the rydberg constant calculate from each measurement with it uncertainty be show in table .2 where equation 10 be use the mean value of the rydberg constant be calculate and the error be add in quadrature give a final value r ∞ 10819294.13 ± 82184.5m −1 for the spectrometer resolution seven set of measurement be take and provide a mean value for card width 2.34±0.02 mm the number of sufficient slit n be then calculate by where 80 lines/mm grate be use and give n=187.2±1.6 accord to equation 9 the resolution of λ 0.4489 ± 0.05 nm the data be interpret in way such that the random error can be minimize firstly the zero order of each wavelength in the spectrum be obtain by calculate the mean of m ±1 to reduce the uncertainty at this order.the importance of this approach be that the diffract line should be symmetrical about the normal and the angel should be same for ±n th order.secondly the second measurement of violet line be not use because the graph suggest the data obtain be wrong.this could due to the intensity of violet light be dimmer than other color which make it more difficult to measure precisely.nevertheless there be four visible hydrogen emission spectrum in balmer series 9 so the forth color might interrupt the reading and hence the result might be record in the wrong order number there be several possibility for systematic error in this experiment for example the light noise from lamp and computer and eye parallax while take the reading.also misalignment and defocus of the instrument might contribute to the error when set up the apparatus or when they be accidentally move during the experiment.furthermore factor such a grate period air pressure or humidity can also have an effect on the measurement in conclusion the rydberg constant and the resolve power of a spectrometer have be deduce by observe hydrogen and sodium spectrum ussing the spectrometer.the first method use be to record the angle of different order for three different wavelength and deduce the rydberg constant from gradient of the graph plot from data.the second method be to measure the efficient grate number for the doublet to just resolve and hence find the resolution the obtain value of the rydberg constant give 1.4 uncertainty compare to the accepted value 10973731.56851m −1 which be quite satisfactory.the result of resolution of the spectrometer show the precision of a spectrometer and this provide sufficient confidence for the result obtain use this instrument the experiment have be do and data have be analyze to minimize error with sufficient approach such a repeat measurement find zero order by average angel at ±1 order and abandon wrong data.also the associate error be calculate in a delicate way.however the experiment can be improve by building up a large data base and observe four color instead of three which be feasible if apparatus be align and focus perfectly.also reduce the background light and fix the lamp position can also improve the

67,GS_JWI426_Redacted,in this report we detail how a spectrometer be use to determine the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ to a relatively high degree of precision use the spectral emission line from excite hydrogen gas we first calibrate the spectrometer to make accurate repeatable measurement before use it to measure the angle at which the maximum of diffract light from the emission spectrum of excite hydrogen occur maximum angle be then record for the observe red cyan and blue spectral line of the balmer series which yield wavelength of 656.12 ± 0.33 nm 485.90 ± 0.41 nm and 433.78 ± 0.38 nm respectively use elementary diffraction grate theory and the rydberg formula base on the bohr model of the atom we then calculate a value for the rydberg constant for each wavelength before use these value to arrive at a final value for 𝑅 ∞ of 1.0975 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 we then finally move on to examine the extent of random error in our result and discus potential cause of systematic error which may have contribute to our obtain value deviation from the accepted value for 𝑅 ∞ of 10973731.6 m -1 1 from a young age we be familiarise with the notion of atom be comprise of negatively charge electron orbit a heavy positively charge nucleus after much development in atomic theory over the last century we now know that atom have a much richer structure involve the idea that electron have quantise energy state and be described probabilistically by their wavefunction one of the key development in atomic theory come in 1913 when the idea that light be emit a discrete quantum of energy a propose by einstein and planck be use by neils bohr to formulate the semi-quantum bohr model of the atom which provide a justification to the then empirically derive rydberg formula the formula itself provide a relation between energy level transition make by electron and the wavelength of photon they emit a we will soon see this equation involves a constant know a the rydberg constant which be what we aim to measure use a diffraction grate spectrometer although more modern and sophisticated photo spectrometric method exist 2 to measure wavelength to an even great degree of accuracy 3 the method present here still provide a relatively accurate value for the rydberg constant despite it make use of a relatively simple experimental setup the spectrometer be in principle a simple piece of apparatus which first collimates a source of light into a single beam which be then normal and incident on a diffraction grate comprise of slit of separation d. from elementary diffraction theory we can recall that whenever the phase difference φ between two ray coincident at a point be an integer multiple m of 2𝜋 the ray will constructively interfere to produce a maximum from figure 1 we can easily see by geometry that the path difference between adjacent ray be equal to 𝑑 sin 𝜃 where 𝜃 be the angle between the ray incident to the m th order maximum and the grate normal since path difference be equal to 𝜆𝜑/2𝜋 we can equate to yield 𝑑 sin 𝜃 𝑚 𝜆 1 from this we can see that a plot of sin 𝜃 against order number will produce a graph whose linear fit will have a gradient 𝜆/𝑑 thus since d be know we can calculate the wavelength of the light pas into the spectrometer which in our case be from the de-excitation of hydrogen atom when the electron de-excite they do so by 'falling from an energy level n down to a level of low energy p and in do so they emit a photon of energy equal to the energy difference traverse by the electron to explain the relation between n p and the wavelength of emit light bohr postulate that the angular momentum l of electron be quantise with relation to planck 's constant 4 such that where ħ be the reduce planck constant bohr then also assume that the electron follow classical circular orbit thus allow for the relation of l to the electron velocity v via 𝐿 𝑚 𝑒 𝑣𝑟 where r be the orbital radius and 𝑚 𝑒 the mass of the electron from this we find that if we now attribute the centripetal force f maintain the orbit to the electrostatic coulomb attraction between the electron and the nucleus which both posse a charge of e for hydrogen we can write where 𝜀 0 be the permittivity of free space this can be rearrange and combine with equation 3 to show that the electron exist at discrete radius 𝑟 𝑛 from the nucleus such that by invoke the non-relativistic equation for kinetic energy and again invoke equation 3 it can be show that the energy 𝐸 𝑛 of an electron in the nth energy level be give by where 𝐸 1 be the ground state the low energy state an electron may occupy now since an emit photon 's energy be equal to the energy decrease an electron experience during de-excitation note energy level have negative value we can write where 𝐸 𝑝 be the magnitude of the energy level the electron de-excites to and 𝜆 be the wavelength of the emit photon if we combine this with equation 6 we arrive the once empirically obtain rydberg equation where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant which may be express a this be the quantity which we will set out to measure by use the spectrometer to determine the wavelength of emit photon if we then finally combine equation 8 with equation 1 we can relate 𝑅 ∞ to the angle 𝜃 of maximum order m to give where g be the gradient of the linear fit for a graph of sin 𝜃 against m thus if n and p be know we can measure 𝑅 ∞ fig 2. an energy diagram show some of the energy level an electron may occupy within a hydrogen atom the arrow show correspond to transition an electron may make during deexcitation the arrow be show in group correspond to the energy level they transit to which be know a the series of the transition show here left to right be the paschen balmer and lyman series 5 dash arrow indicate the infinite amount of possible transition due to electron transition from the infinite number of high energy level whose limit be the ionisation energy of hydrogen figure 2 show some of the theoretically infinite possible transition an electron may make during de-excitation in our experiment we will be observe only the balmer series which be the collection of transition where the electron de-excites to the second energy level correspond to p 2 a we be restrict to only be able to measure visible wavelength in our experiment we will measure the first three wavelength correspond to n 3 4 and 6 also refer to a ba-α ba-β and ba-γ transition the first part of the experiment consist largely of set up the spectrometer correctly to enable it to make accurate and repeatable measurement to begin the eye piece be focus onto the crosshair which be position such that the line be diagonal and would not be parallel to spectral line the camera lens be then focus to an object at an arbitrarily long distance ≈ 10m to ensure that the source can be accurately resolve the room be darken to minimise background light before a test sodium lamp be then turn on and place in front of the slit a mirror be secure into the same central position a where the grate will reside the telescope be then align with the collimator and the slit be set at a small width to aid in determine peak focus before it be place in front of the collimator the collimator focus be the adjust until maximum focus of the slit be achieve the crosshair be then align to the centre of the slit and the correspond angular position be record a 169°00 the telescope be then rotate through 90° result in a position of 79°00 ± 1 the telescope be temporarily secure and grate table hold the mirror be rotate until the sodium emergent from the narrow slit be incident on the crosshair see through the telescope at this point the rotational position of the table be record again a 79°00 ± 1 to ensure it have not move before it be then rotate by 45° such that the grate table and by extension the mirror be normal to the ray incident to the mirror after be unsecured the telescope be then move back round to it approximate initial position the mirror be then replace by a 300 div/mm diffraction grate orient such that the grate be approximately vertical we then view the spectral pattern of the diffract sodium light through the telescope the fine adjustment screw on the central grate table be then alter until all the visible spectral line on both side of the central maximum be a vertical a possible with respect to the crosshair and by extension the plane of rotation to minimise the skew of the pattern to enable a many maximum to be see a possible with this the setup process conclude and we then move on to make measurement the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen lamp before we proceed to record the angular position of the maximum for the observe red cyan and blue spectral line use the vernier scale on the spectrometer for each colour the first and second order maximum position be record a total of three time result in a total of 45 measurement be make include the measurement of the position of the central maximum the 3 rd order maximum be very faint compare to the other maximum and their position be hard to determine thus they be not measure a they would introduce a significant amount of random error through the spectrometer telescope we be able to resolve red cyan and blue spectral line which by reference to figure 2 we can attribute to the n 3 n 4 and n 5 initial energy level in the balmer series respectively a expect note that the wavelength we have call blue may be interpret a violet or purple by some for all measurement a diffraction grate of slit separation 3.33 ± 0.03 µm be use all the angle for each set of measurement be normalise with respect to the position of the central maximum to mitigate the introduction of systematic error from the telescope be misalign in between set of measurement be make the main source of statistical uncertainty arises from the fact that it be difficult to determine the exact location of the maximum of a spectral line due to the subjective nature of the human eye the degree of this effect be positively correlate with the observe width which be obtain by measure the thickness of the maximum correspond to m 1 for each colour which for all wavelength be see to be roughly 25 although the width of the bright region in which one could realistically determine to be the maximum have a small width of around 10 the width of this be then halve to obtain the effective error of 5 this effect be exacerbate by the vernier scale be inherently difficult to read exactly by eye especially give the dim light result in a designate reading error of around ± 3 if we consider this along with the maximum width error the result uncertainty of the measurement of each maximum be around 6 which be then incorporate into the gradient error by plot figure 3 we obtain an error-weighted fit for each wavelength use python 's covariance matrix function from this the gradient be then use along with the split separation and equation 1 to calculate the wavelength of each of the observe colour a summarise below for each wavelength the correspond rydberg constant and it error be then calculate by application of equation 10 see appendix for detail the wavelength for red and cyan agree with their accepted value but blue do not derive rydberg constant m -1 1.0974 ± 0.0005 × 10 7 cyan 1.0980 ± 0.0009 × 10 7 1.0979 ± 0.0006 × 10 7 table ii a summary show the rydberg constant and their uncertainty derive from the wavelength show in table i. the error associate with each wavelength be calculate base on the error of the gradient of it correspond linear fit and the error in slit separation we can see from table i that all of our measure value and their uncertainty agree with the accepted value from the value in table ii we obtain a mean value for the rydberg constant of 𝑅 ∞ 1.0977 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 a deviation of 0.048 from the accepted value of 10973731.6 m -1 there be many possible factor which may have contribute to the overall systematic uncertainty in our measurement the most likely and obvious of which be the improper setup of the spectrometer in particular the misalignment of the diffraction grate cause it to be nonnormal to the ray incident on it another possible source of systematic error can be attribute to the variation in wavelength result from the refractive index of air not be exactly equal to that of air in a vacuum to investigate this idea we can consider the wave equation and recall the definition of a refractive index n of a material a the ratio of c to the wave speed in the medium from this we can then relate a wavelength 𝜆 of light in a medium to it wavelength in a vacuum 𝜆 0 a 𝜆 0 𝑛𝜆 10 if we now take n to be the accepted value of the refractive index of air at standard temperature and pressure a 𝑛 1.000277 6 from these value we obtain the value show in table ii and a final value for the rydberg constant of 𝑅 ∞ 1.0975 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 which have a small deviation from the accepted value of just 0.012 the wavelength for blue be now also in agreement with the accepted value show in table ii note that the assumption that the air use be under standard condition be valid a it can be show apply elden 's formula 7 to possible deviation from standard condition yield negligible difference in refractive index the uncertainty associate with the value of n itself be consider negligible a it experimental uncertainty be of the order ± 10 -8 our experiment set out to measure the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy use only a spectrometer and the bohr model of the atom our final obtain value for 𝑅 ∞ of 1.0975 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 agrees with the accepted value with a percentage difference of just 0.012 although our method obtain a relatively accurate result there be several way in which it could be modify to far increase the accuracy for example the great source of random error arose from the difficulty in accurately reading the vernier scale which could easily be solve via the digitisation of the vernier scale this would carry the add advantage of make the measurement process less laborious meaning that more measurement could be make in our limited allocate time which would far reduce the statistical error the other major source of random error which arose due to the difficulty in determine the position of the central point of maximum could be resolve use a photodiode which would allow u to quantitatively determine the point at which peak intensity and by extension the maximum occur the use of a photodiode would also have the add benefit of lift our restriction on be able to measure only visible wavelength meaning that we would be able to obtain measurement from the other transition series of hydrogen depict in figure 2 thus allow for a large data set and a form of verification that bohr 's model do indeed hold for all energy transition a point worth note be that the red maximum be notably brighter and more prominent than the other colour which may be attribute to the fact that at low voltage the baα transition be more probable to occur 8 result in red have a great intensity to resolve this one could simply increase the voltage a the other two transition probability increase with voltage up to a limit another possible reason for red have a great intensity be that in the visible spectrum low wavelength light be emit at a great intensity by hot body such a the incandescent lamp use in the laboratory a described by planck 's radiation law 9 although this effect could be rule out by simply carry out the experiment in a strictly zero-background light environment although a consideration of light wavelength dependence on refractive index result in our calculate value agree with the accepted value to a marginally great extent the fact that all value for 𝑅 ∞ be great than the accepted value suggests some form of systematic error be likely from the general mis-alignment of the equipment which can only be remedied by take great care during the setup procedure or by use more sophisticated equipment the standard rule of error propagation be apply to equation 10 to give an expression for the uncertainty 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ in the rydberg constant a where 𝜎 𝑑 be the absolute uncertainty in slit separation 𝜎 𝐺 be the absolute uncertainty in the gradient and k be a constant define a 1/4

68,GS_ZZF399_Redacted,in this experiment the diffraction pattern of a collimate beam of light from a hydrogen lamp incident on a grate be observe calculate two of the balmer transition wavelength and use these to calculate the rydberg constant from the diffraction pattern of the red transition wavelength the rydberg constant r ∞ be calculate to be 10920433.3 +/-9208.4 m -1 whereas use the turquoise transition wavelength r ∞ be calculate equally successfully to be 11011588.6 +/-14990.0 m -1 give error of 0.49 and 0.34 respectively in comparison to the true value of 10973731.6 m -1 when electromagnetic radiation be pas through a spectrometer the beam be collimate by a lens and then disperse by a grate this allows the diffraction pattern to be focus observe and use the vernier scale the position of the maximum can be measure for a beam of wavelength λ and separation d of slit in the grate the maximum of order m will be at the angle θ described by 1 𝜃 𝑠𝑖𝑛 −1 𝑚 𝜆 𝑑 from which the wavelength can be calculate use this and knowledge of the transition wavelength of the source of radiation in this case hydrogen in a hydrogen lamp the rydberg constant can then be calculate in this experiment we aim to observe the diffraction pattern of the different transition wavelength of the balmer series characteristic to the define energy shift within the hydrogen atom in excitation use knowledge of these shift we also aim to accurately measure the rydberg constant when an electric current be pas through a tube contain hydrogen gas it cause the excitation and subsequent deexcitation of the electron cause the emission of photon of characteristic wavelength to the distinct energy gap between energy level due to the energy of the electron be quantise four of these transition wavelength exist in the spectrum of visible light so can be observe by the human eye in a spectrometer the beam from the hydrogen lamp be collimate by a lens before fall incident on a diffraction grate at the grate multiple path be take by the beam to the point where the intensity be be observe each have slightly differ path length cause the path to be at different point in their phase progression cause the path to interfere the difference in path length be give by 2 difference in path length 𝑑 sin 𝜃 found from the assumption that the path to the point of measurement be virtually parallel and so can be view like in the follow figure carefully put in place and the position of the 0 th order maximum where θ 0° be found to be ≈ 66° use the vernier 's scale allow it to be identify in the result initially the diffraction pattern of the red light be examine the telescope be rotate to the great degree where the maximum be still discernible and the location of this maximum be record the position of the successive maximum be then record until the maximum become indiscernible cover the whole spectrum that would still give precise measurement the measurement be then repeat by a second observer to give data for comparison to check for erroneous result the same process be then repeat for the diffraction pattern result from the turquoise light the blue and the violet diffraction pattern be observe to check for similar trend however not measure due to have too few discernible maximum to give a trend that would provide accurate result the sine of the location of the maximum be then plot against the order in the relationship give by equation 4 which be thus plot use the gradient of which easily give the wavelength of the light use the balmer series the 2 calculate wavelength be equate with the correspond wavelength produce from change in energy level of the electron in hydrogen described by their transition from initial state n n 3 for the red light n 4 for turquoise to final state p p 2 in the balmer series allow the rydberg constant to be calculate use equation 5 for the 2 different diffraction pattern due to the calculation for the rydberg constant only require a string of multiplication the error analysis only require the use of two equation for their propagation 6 𝜎 𝑓 f√ equation 6 be apply in the case of calculate error in slit space d from error in the number of slit per unit distance s a d s -1 and error in the calculate rydberg constant from error in the wavelength 7 be apply in the case of calculate error in wavelength from the error in gradient m from the calculate covariance matrix and slit space d. for both diffraction pattern analyse the 2 set of data 1 from each observer be treat independently and compare to check for any erroneous result once compare and trend checked the 2 value for rydberg 's constant be calculate and a mean average be take due to error in θ be so small in comparison to the measure value the error bar have not be include in the graph for clarity the value for r ∞ determine experimentally be compare against the accepted value 12 r ∞ 10973731.6 m -1 and so can be see that the calculate value both come very close to the true value have error of 0.49 and 0.34 for the red and turquoise diffraction pattern respectively the result also come with very small uncertainty 0.08 and 0.14 respectively with the experiment have very high precision with very little random error however neither allows for the accepted value to fall within their range include uncertainty this suggests there be some small systematic error in the experiment or a random error exists from a source that have n't be identify these systematic error may possibly exist in manufacturing error in the slit error in focus or misalignment of the spectrometer or even in change condition in the laboratory additional random error that could account for the accepted value fall out of the range of uncertainty be in the maximum not be perfectly distinct a the initial slit be imperfect due to obstruction on it edge the edge of maximum be not a sharp a would be ideal for the experiment the orientation of maximum be also not perfectly vertical despite somewhat be counteract by align the crosshair with the midpoint of the maximum this may be another source of uncertainty additionally maximum at large angle be not perfectly focus add uncertainty and possibly identify a systematic error in focus and their intensity drop significantly both reduce the precision in measurement for the location of the maximum these error would have be partially cover in the error found in the gradient from the covariance matrix of the line of best fit however their magnitude may be underrepresented in the final uncertainty an indication of a source of possible source of systematic error could be see when observe the maximum upon examination there be maximum that could not be identify use the balmer series at regular interval hint at an error in set-up or with the grate or other equipment however if the average between the two calculate value for the rydberg constant be take it give 13 average calculate value for r ∞ 10966011.0 +/-8796.2 m -1 which have only 0.07 error and also include the accepted value for the rydberg constant within it range of uncertainty while maintain a very high precision overall this experiment be highly successful achieve the aim set out of calculate the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy with the final calculate value only have an error of 0.07 with the accepted value also fall within the range of uncertainty however the value calculate directly from each diffraction pattern be not quite a accurate and the accepted value lay outside both range of uncertainty suggest there be a small systematic error or an unaccounted/not fully account source of random error the most likely cause for this be a systematic error in the setup or manufacturing error of the equipment or slit see in the existence of unidentifiable maximum when the diffraction pattern be observe which may have alter the pattern and give rise to the small amount of error additionally there be some source of random error that have uncertainty that may have be underrepresented by the uncertainty in the gradient stem from the uncertainty in location of the maximum however for these random error to increase the uncertainty to the point where it include the accepted value it would require the final standard error in their result to increase by a factor of 5 and 2 respectively which be heavily unlikely due to the small magnitude of the uncertainty in location therefore be unlikely to be a significant factor in the inaccuracy of the calculate value ultimately both calculate result and the final average value have a very high level of accuracy and so any small factor or change in condition may have cause these error due to their magnitude a can be see in it high accuracy the experiment have many strength include the high precision measurement the experiment allow to be take and the ease of the experiment allow a large amount of data to be take however despite it large amount of success the experiment can still be improve upon in particular reduce the background light would allow for the width of the initial slit and the maximum to be reduce due to an increase in visibility of the maximum increase precision in the measurement this change would also allow for maximum of blue and violet colour to be more visible and so also accurately measure give more possible data to support or dispute the calculate value increase accuracy and confidence in the final result,superficial,bal
69,GS_IHJ555_Redacted,where 𝜆 be the wavelength r ∞ be the rydberg constant with a measure value of 10973731.6 m -1 n and p be integer represent the energy level n be the initial state and p be the final state 2 by use equation 1 and the theoretical value of the rydberg constant we can calculate the wavelength and predict the colour of the light that we expect to see the light with the long wavelength be emit when electron drop from initial state 3 to final state 2. the wavelength be calculate to be 656 nm use equation 1 and this wavelength fall into the wavelength range for red light therefore the light with the long wavelength we expect to see be red light the grate have a large number of very narrow slit which be equally space the grate equation can be use to determine the wavelength of light where dsinθ be the path difference a show in fig 6 and m be the order number rearrange this equation we get therefore if we plot sinθ vs. m the gradient of the line of best fit of the graph will be the value of since we know the value of d we can calculate the wavelength of the light after determine the wavelength we have all the data we need to calculate the experimental value of rydberg constant use equation 1 fig 6. the path difference between light that go through the grate in this experiment we use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta and the wavelength of the light emit by a hydrogen lamp then calculate the rydberg constant in order to set up the spectrometer we focus the eyepiece and camera and align them with the axis of the collimator we set the cross wire a an `` x `` since it be easy to use this way then we turn the telescope which be the eyepiece and the camera lens through 90 degree and adjust the grate table until a reflect image be see in the eyepiece this mean that the incident beam from the collimator be now at 45 degree to the grate surface a show in fig 7. then we rotate the grate through precisely 45 degree accord to the scale so that it be set at 0 degree to the incident light beam 2 in order to make sure that the spectrum be not inclined we cover the upper and low part of the light source use two piece of tape a show in fig 8 thus the light be shorten and be fit into the cross wire completely a show in fig 9. by do this when we rotate the eyepiece we be allow to check if the spectrum be inclined left spectrum observe without use tape to shorten them when rotate the telescope can not check if the spectrum be inclined right spectrum observe after use tape to shorten them can check if the emission spectrum be inclined when rotate the telescope we rotate the telescope left and right horizontally until we observe a light and note the value of theta at that position in order to get a value for the uncertainty in theta me and my lab partner both read the value and we estimate that there be an error of ± 1.45 × 10 -4 radian associate with our measurement since both of u read a value of theta for each order we have two value of theta associate with the light since the space between the central maximum and the emit light with the same colour of an order that have the same magnitude should be equal e.g the red emit light of order ± 1 have the same distance from the central maximum the angle theta of the positive and negative order should have the same magnitude therefore we plot the sine of the average value of theta against the magnitude of the order accord to equation 3 the gradient of the line of best fit corresponds to the value of therefore by multiply the gradient by d we determine the wavelength by use equation 1 we can obtain the value of rydberg constant iv error result discussion by use equation 1 and the theoretical value of the rydberg constant we predict that the long wavelength of the light that we could observe be 656 nm this light be create when electron drop from energy level three to energy level two use the standard colour spectrum chart we found that the light with the long wavelength that we could expect to see be the red light refer to equation 1 we need the value of wavelength to determine the rydberg constant accord to equation 3 the graph sinθ vs. m should be a straight line and the gradient of the line of best fit corresponds to the value of by plot the data from table i. we obtain graph 1.0 and graph 2.0. in this experiment the grate we use have 78.8 line per mm therefore the space d be 0.0127 mm the gradient of the line of best fit for the green light be 0.04208 rad/m multiply this value by 0.0127 × 10 -3 m we determine that the wavelength of green light be 535 ± 185 nm similarly we determine the wavelength of red light be 678 ± 185 nm since the wavelength be a function of and a constant d we calculate the error associate with the wavelength by do differentiation formula use be show in appendix rearrange equation 1 for the rydberg constant therefore the rydberg constant be a function of 𝜆 n and p. since n and p be the energy level there be no error associate with them and 2 can be treat a a constant therefore only 𝜆 contributes to the error associate with 𝑅 we determine the error associate with it by do differentiation with respect to 𝜆 formula use be show in appendix we calculate the error associate with the rydberg constant to be ± 28993.5 m -1 for the red emit light and ± 35283.0 m -1 for the green emit light theta θ rad order table i. the value of theta associate with the 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd order red light and green light since there be energy release when electron drop from a high energy state to a low one and energy can be calculate by use where e be the energy h be planck 's constant and f be the frequency also where c be the speed of light 𝜆 be the wavelength combine equation 5 and 6 we get therefore energy be inversely proportional to the wavelength the light with the long wavelength be emit when the least amount of energy be release thus for the red light it initial state be 3 final state be 2. therefore n be equal to 3 and p be equal to 2. by use equation 1 and the wavelength we determine we calculate that the rydberg constant be 10622602.54 ± 28993.5 m -1 for the green light it initial state be 4 final state be 2. therefore we calculate the rydberg constant to be 9978172.747 ± 35283.0 m -1 compare these value with the theoretical value of the rydberg constant 10973731.6 m -1 there be 3.1 difference between the two value for the red emit light and 9.0 between the two value for the green emit light calculation be show in appendix the rydberg constant calculate use the data for the red light be more accurate than the one calculate use data of the green light one of the reason be that during the experiment we notice that the red light be observe to be more focus than the green light therefore we be more likely to get accurate measurement of theta for the red light graph 1.0 sinθ vs. m for the green light graph 2.0 sinθ vs. m for the red light the error associate with the reading of theta be random error it be cause by our judgement to determine this error we read off the theta from the scale alternatively and estimate that the uncertainty associate with the theta we measure be ± 1.45×10 -4 radian there be other source of error that affected our data for example when we observe the light the light be a bit blurry so defocus exist this mean that when we read off the angle the value be not precise also there be background light give that we be not work in a complete dark environment this could have impact on our data because the background light affected our judgement to place the emit light on the same place for each measurement and make it hard for u to observe the light clearly therefore we could not get measurement of theta also since we align the spectrometer manually the equipment could be not in the completely align position a a result of misalignment the value of angle theta we measure could be not accurate v. conclusion by do this experiment we determine the rydberg constant r ∞ which have a measure value of 10973731.6 m -1 to 9978172.747 ± m -1 for the green emit light and 10622602.54 ± m -1 for the red emit light the method use in this experiment be to use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta associate with the emit light for an order m then calculate the wavelength 𝜆 associate with the light via equation 2 together with these data we use equation 1 to calculate the rydberg constant the percent difference between the theoretical value of rydberg constant and the experimental value we obtain be 9.0 for the green emit light and 3.1 for the red emit light calculation be show in appendix this experiment show that one way to determine the rydberg constant be to use a spectrometer during the experiment we measure the data we need without major problem and the final result be relatively close to the theoretical value of r ∞ however we spent a large amount of time do the set-up therefore we fail to complete all the calculation within the time give from this experiment we learnt a way to determine the rydberg constant also we reinforce our knowledge on identify source of error such a defocus misalignment we also have a deeper understand of the importance of preliminary data by take preliminary data we gain some knowledge about the process thus we can take the definitive data more efficiently and accurately appendix formula use in calculate percent difference,expert,the

constructive if two beam of light have a phase difference of an integer n of 2𝜋n at these point maximum will be observe and the angle from the incident beam can be measure use the telescope from figure 2 we can use trigonometry to get the equation for this first order maximum where d be the slit separation in meter and 𝜃 be the angle of diffraction in radian this equation be for a path difference be one wavelength and so the other maximum occur when the path difference be an integer n wavelength apart this give the equation where n be the order of the maximum to obtain the most accurate value for the wavelength of 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 the spectrometer be align such that the grate be perpendicular to the incident light this ensures the central maximum of each 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 will be on top of each other to get a standard zero value it also mean that the interference pattern be in accordance with 6 a 6 would not be valid for light enter non-perpendicular to the slit this ensures the most accurate result possible the first procedure carry out to align the spectrometer be focus the eyepiece such that the cross be clear this be to stop strain on the eye over long period of time it be also ensure that the crosshairs show a `` cross `` shape oppose to a `` plus `` a a cross be easy to distinguish on a dark background secondly the objective lens be focus this be conduct by move the spectrometer to a window the objective lens be then adjust until the building opposite come into focus now the collimator need to be focus with the telescope this be carry out in a dark room and start by illuminate a sodium lamp at the end of the collimator the lamp be put a close a possible to the slit a the light intensity increase via the inverse square law a you move the lamp closer this ensures that the brightest pattern be obtain also applies with the hydrogen lamp a slit then become visible in the telescope when in line with the collimator and so the collimator be adjust until focus now the spectrometer be focus it next need to be align to do this first the telescope be move precisely 90 degree around from the point where the crosshairs be on the slit a mirror be then place into the grate table and the table be rotate until the slit be again visible in the telescope at this point the telescope be return 90 degree and the grate table be rotate 45 degree the reading on the spectrometer should now be note a this be the reference `` zero `` point instead of a mirror in the grate table the chosen grate be then insert and a 78.8 line per mm grate be found to be most suit in find the optimal number of spectral line next the grate table need to be parallel with the spectrometer to do this the pattern be observe in the telescope and the height of the table be adjust until all the line in the series be at the same height a well a this remember to the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen lamp the sodium lamp be use for set up a be it bright and the hydrogen lamp get too hot if left on for long period of time which be not ideal during calibration of the equipment when measure diffraction angle it be ensure to not leave the hydrogen lamp on too long to avoid it become too hot and spectral line too dim in our experiment there be three visible colour of line these be from 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 and be produce by emission of certain energy photon and be part of the balmer series these line be measure until they be no longer clearly visible either side of the central maximum this produce four line either side of the central maximum for each colour and the angle at which the line be present be measure the grate spectrometer use have a vernier scale and so care be make to use it correctly a the number on it be small and hard to read after a long period of use some of the line in the telescope become hard to resolve and to distinguish colour and so the hydrogen lamp would be turn off and wait to cool this be to ensure that no line be miss during observation reduce the chance of outlier in our result from figure 3 you can see that the wavelength of the aqua light be much closer to the blue to alpha a the linear fit be much closer together this be because a previously mention from 3 a you move far away from the nucleus of hydrogen the energy level energy get closer together by and inverse square law and so the p=4 and p=5 energy level energy be closer than the p=3 and p=4 this lead to possible confusion between the aqua and blue line a not only be they close together but be also of similar colour this be a possible source of random error in the experiment and so great effort be make to distinguish between line by not keep the hydrogen lamp on for too long once all angle have be record dsin𝜃 against n be plot for red aqua and blue from 6 the gradient of this plot be equal to the wavelength of the photon emit and the graph should show a linear relationship with these wavelength 2 be then use to calculate the rydberg constant 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 wavelength be thus found to equal 657.0 ± 1 n𝑚 −1 491.3 ± 1 n𝑚 −1 and 443.5 ± another possible source of error could be in the diffraction grate in that it could be dirty thus diffract the light slightly or the line in the grate could be slightly not parallel from it manufacture this be a problem a in the derivation of 6 it be assume that there be a constant slit separation to reduce the chance for these source of error the grate should be thoroughly clean before use a well a this different brand grate should be use this ensures that the slit be perfectly parallel thus reduce the chance of that systematic error use the wavelength and 2 rydberg constant for 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 be found to be 10950000 ± 200000 𝑚 −1 10850000 ± 300000 𝑚 −1 and 10730000 ± 300000 𝑚 −1 give a mean value of 𝑅 ∞ 10850000 ± 90000 𝑚 −1 which be 1.088 away from the accepted value of 10973731.568508 𝑚 −1 which have a relative uncertainty of 5.9×10 −12 the investigation be to determine an accurate value of the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer and visible emission spectrum in the balmer series through this experimental procedure the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10850000 ± 90000 𝑚 −1 which be 1.088 away from the accepted value of 10973731.568508 𝑚 −1 which have a relative uncertainty of 5.9×10 −12 the accepted value be outside the suppose uncertainty in the measure value this show there be still step that could be take to ensure a more accurate result to reduce the error in the experiment the whole method should be repeat use a completely different set of equipment thus ensure the data be reproducible furthermore it ensures that there be no systematic bias in the set of equipment that be originally be use it also reduces the chance of unavoidable human error cause anomalous result in the data finally proven in the appendix there be another fourth violet emission 𝐻 𝛿 in the balmer series which be in the visible spectrum it be from transition from the 6 th energy level it would be beneficial to measure this a it give u more data thus reduce uncertainty in the value of the calculate rydberg constant it be however difficult for the human eye to distinguish and so a charge-coupled device would need to be add the fine structure constant α can be far express by other physical constant 7 the error propagation be conduct by the use the follow equation where 𝜎 𝑚 be the best estimate of random error in the mean 𝜎 𝑛−1 be the sample standard deviation and n be the number of independent measurement 7,extended,the
71,GS_GQV977_Redacted,"use a hydrogen lamp and by passing it emit light through a grate spectrometer the angle at which the emit line be diffract these angle be use to calculate the wavelength of the photon and so therefore the rydberg constant which link the wavelength of emit photon from the atom to the change in energy level of it electron three value of this constant r ∞ be found by observe the emission line from an electron drop from n=3,4,5 down to n=2 balmer series and these result be concordant give a value of r ∞ =10,562,000±326,000m -1 5sf when electron in an atom be excite they be promote to a high energy level and rapidly drop back down since the energy of each level be precisely define the energy change from each drop in energy level will also come in precise value due to conservation law this energy will be release in the form of a photon -but how will we know what the wavelength would be it can be show that for an energy level in a hydrogen atom n=n the energy of an electron in this level will be proportional to 1 𝑛 2 1 therefore if an electron be drop from energy level n=n to level n=p the energy of the photon would be proportional to 1 𝑛 2 − 1 𝑝 2 for the follow experiment we will let p=2 and so p 2 =4 2 we now have energy e constant × 1 by define the rydberg constant to be 𝑅 ∞ − 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 ℎ𝑐 we now have 2 observe the spectral line upon observe the different line we would see a variety of colour the most clearly visible be red blue and indigo on the spectrum therefore before begin to measure diffraction angle we calculate to which value of principal quantum number n each colour correspond it be found that the aforementioned colour correspond to n=3,4 and 5 respectively 5 we note the angle that the vernier scale would read when the telescope be at normal incidence i.e when the angle θ be zero one experimenter would then slowly move the telescope around take care not to miss any line of the colour for which we be look we obtain all result for the red line first then blue then indigo and would align the equipment 's crosshair with the centre of this line they would take the angle note it down and without refer to this result would move the telescope back to the centre and repeat the reading the result would then be compare give some idea of the uncertainty involve 6 the angle on the scale at θ=0 be then subtract from the value give when the line be in the centre of the field of view to give a value of θ for each maximum the result obtain be treat independently for each colour of spectral line to help identify and eliminate any anomalous result due to potential systematic error when measure the angle for a colour we then plot graph use python of sinθ against the order of the fringe m which take integer value the wavelength λ be found by rearrange equation 3 and by exploit the fact that sinθ be directly proportional to m to give the equation where d be the diffraction grate 's slit separation we then rearrange equation 2 to give which will soon be use to find the constant in the follow section the first calculation do be to find the value of d the line separation for the diffraction grate the grate be say to have 300 line per mm and so this give 3×10 5 line m -1 this value could simply be invert to give d -and the answer will be kept in it exact form to avoid unnecessary round error therefore we have a value of 𝑑 1 3×10 5 m. the result obtain for each colour line 's maximum from m=-2 to m=+2 be a follow where m be the order of maximum and θ m and θ s be the angle independently measure by each of u the angle be give in division of sixtieth of a degree because the vernier scale can be read to give angle to the near arc-minute which be the mean and the uncertainty for the angle be numerically found and then sinθ be plot against m to obtain the three follow straight-line graph for the code use to determine the gradient and error see the appendix 6 ideally error bar would be include clearly only for the y-axis give that order m only take integer value but not enough information be collect to quantitatively define these very well see conclusion the gradient for the line be obtain and then multiply by the line separation d a in equation 4 to give value for the wavelength these be then insert into equation 3 which give the follow value of the rydberg constant use the result for the red line rydberg 's constant be 10,987,139. use the result for the blue line rydberg 's constant be 10,934,464. use the result for the indigo line rydberg 's constant be 9,762,914. fortunately although the gradient of the graph may have be inaccurate due to the lack of error bar have 3 independently calculate value of the constant help to provide an alternative way to find the standard error of the result found for the rydberg constant that which corresponds to the value 𝜎 √𝑛 ⁄ the follow calculation be therefore carry out on python to find this constants=sp.array

therefore found rydberg 's constant to be 10561505.7362 with a standard error of 326259.849914 we be force to consider whether the result for indigo should be discard from the final calculation because they be below the other 2 result that be far more concordant with each other if this low value be cause by an error this would most likely be a systematic error consider the very low deviation of point from the line of best fit on the graph for indigo however since only three result be obtain for the constant we deem it unreasonable to consider this result an outlier especially since it be clearly of a similar enough magnitude to the other value so eventually by use all three of the above result our final value of the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10,562,000 ± 326,000 m -1 5sf the accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10,973,732m -1 whereas my experimental value come out a 10,562,000±326,000m -1 my maximum would therefore be 10,888,000m -1 which would still be just below the true 7 value but be not too distant the percentage error be -4 1sf which be in fact relatively small the relatively high accuracy could be consider to be down to the equipment include the very fine vernier scale and the very fine and carefully align crosshairs use to orientate the telescope there could be many potential reason for inaccuracy however include many systematic error these may in particular may have played a part in cause the value of 𝑅 ∞ from the indigo line to be low than the mean of the other two result in fact by 11 a possibility for this could be the misalignment of the spectrometer it could easily have be knock by other student walk past and we do not check in between our reading that the alignment be correct an argument against this be the cause could be that for m=0 on the indigo graph θ be a close if not closer to zero than be θ on the graph for the first two colour observedwe must therefore look to other cause it could be possible that although the high care be put into ensure that the hydrogen lamp be not left on for more than ten minute at a time there be no evidence against this mistake have accidentally be make before and during the collection of result for the indigo fringe the increase temperature of the lamp do not cause it to turn off but instead could have heat the air around it and decrease the surround pressure lead to diffraction of the photon emit a they pas through region of different pressure even before reach the grate this would give a different value of θ and therefore of 𝑅 ∞ the increase temperature may also have affected humidity -again affect diffraction another systematic error would include any slight change in lamp position although the slit remain at the same orientation a the telescope assume no problem here light would still be come in at a slightly different angle if the lamp itself be to the side another error could be confusion of the fringe with background light which be unlikely because of the clear straight-line trend show for each graph or even with other faint nearby diffraction maximum from other energy level change -or even other heat element near the lamp a for uncertainty calculation this would have be much improve by consider the actual width of the diffraction fringe -which a a matter of fact turn out to be considerably wider than the area cover by the crosshair 8 this would have give a much well estimate of the spread of value that could possibly be obtain when take result rather than compare the two experimenter result when find the angle at the fringe 's 'middle the uncertainty be therefore not found a accurately a possible -especially with the lack of error bar -but the value of 𝑅 ∞ stayed relatively true to the expect value without too large a standard error of

splitting light base on it wavelength when spectrum be study wavelength intensity and other property of the light beam be measure these property can give insight into anything the light have interact with before enter the spectrometer spectroscopy be use in the study of thing a small a electron to a large a star and be therefore one of the most important field of experimental physic 1 in this report the technique of spectroscopy be employ to check for the presence of the element hydrogen lithium copper and sodium in the sun 's atmosphere establish the chemical composition of star be important a it hold the key to understand star formation prove that this technique work for the sun 's atmosphere open the door for use of the technique on other star or any extrasolar entity that emits a continuous spectrum this could help far the understand of the formation of the universe to find out if one of the previously mention element be present in the sun 's atmosphere the element emission spectrum be first determine the grate spectrometer split light by wavelength and allow for the calculation of prominent wavelength the spectrum of hydrogen be obtain from a hydrogen lamp which excite hydrogen atom into emit light the sodium copper and lithium be all burn in salt form use a blowtorch the sodium and lithium be burn in their `` chloride `` salt form the chlorine require a lot more energy than the blowtorch to emit light and so the spectrum obtain be purely from the metal the same be true for the copper which be burn in it `` sulphate `` form once the spectrum of hydrogen sodium copper and lithium have be determine they be compare to the fraunhofer line these be give to the student by the lab assistant 3 the fraunhofer line be first note in 1802 by wollaston 3 in 1814 fraunhofer who the line be name after start work to determine the wavelength of the line which he label from letter a to k. these line be show in table i. forty-five year after the discovery of the fraunhofer line it be found by kirchoff and bunsen that the line coincide with the emission spectrum of element they theorise that since the light from the sun originates from fusion reaction in it core it must pa through the atmosphere where some wavelength be absorbed by element such a hydrogen this process be discus far in part b of section ii the theory section of this report this process be what cause the dark line to appear in the spectrum of the sun when view from the earth the grate spectrometer investigate fraunhofer line s the diffraction grate produce point of constructive and destructive interference at angle base on the wavelength of the light diffract through the grate a diagram of light travel through a grate can be see in fig 1. note that for an actual grate there be many more beam of light than the two show in fig 1. however by symmetry the light will interfere constructively at the same angle for all beam therefore this diagram can be use to determine the relationship between angle and wavelength a can be see in fig 1 the upper beam will travel a great optical path length than the low beam from trigonometry it can be see that this path difference will be equal to the slit separation multiply by the sine of the diffraction angle for constructive interference the optical path difference must be equal to an integer number of wavelength this give the relationship between the angle for constructive interference and the wavelength of light passing through the grate 𝑚𝜆 𝑑 sin 𝜃 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength in metre 𝑑 be the slit separation in metre this be give by the grate use 𝑚 be the order of the peak 0 for central maximum and then numbered a 1 2 3 … a 𝜃 increase and 𝜃 be the angle with the normal for that peak where constructive interference occurs to calculate the wavelength experimentally the sine of the angle which cause constructive interference can be measure for several peak the angle can then be plot against their peak 's order m the gradient of this relationship will be equal to wavelength divide by the slit separation this give the relationship 2 from 2 we can obtain 𝜆 experimentally use 𝜆 𝑑 × 𝑑 sin 𝜃 𝑑𝑚 3 provide we measure the angle of diffraction at several peak quantum mechanic tell u that an electron can only exist around an atom at certain radius these radius correspond to specific energy the low energy radius be closer to the nucleus of atom for an electron to transition between these energy level it must receive or lose all the energy instantaneously when this happens the electron usually emits or absorbs light a see in fig 2. the energy gap between orbitals vary from element to element this mean that the set of energy require to promote or demote electron in an element be unique to that element from the planck-einstein equation it be know that 𝐸 ℎ𝜈 4 where 𝐸 be the energy of a light wave in joule 𝜈 be the frequency of the light wave in hertz and ℎ be planck 's constant which be approximately 6.63 × 10 −34 𝐽 • 𝑠 from 4 it can be deduce that the wavelength of the light emit or absorbed by an electron be give by 5 where δ𝐸 be the energy difference between the two energy level and c be the speed of light which be approximately 3 × 10 8 𝑚 • 𝑠 −1 it follow from 5 that if every element have a unique set of energy gap then every element will emit and absorb a unique set of wavelength this mean that when electron in atom be demote they will emit light of specific wavelength this be know a an element 's emission spectrum an element 's absorption spectrum can be found by passing a continuous light spectrum through atom of say element the wavelength correspond to energy gap in the atom will be absorbed by the electron this leaf narrow band of low intensity in the result spectrum an element 's absorption and emission spectrum be complementary meaning that the band of low intensity in the absorption spectrum correspond to the band of emit light in the emission spectrum fig 2. two electron be demote to low energy level the energy lose be emit a electromagnetic radiation 1 iii experimental set up fig 3 show the basic part of the grate spectrometer use the spectrometer use for this experiment be the `` pasco sp-9268a `` 2 the grate employ have 2001 line per inch or around 78.78lines per mm 1 this give a slit separation of approximately 1.269 × 10 −5 𝑚. the main angle scale be comprise of separation of half a degree and the vernier read in arc minute to set up the apparatus for this experiment the grate be remove from the holder the eyepiece be then focus onto the crosshair such that it appear on an image 5-10m from the camera this be do in order to reduce eye strain a light source be then pas through the slit the camera be rotate such that the beam of light be centre on the crosshair the collimator be then focus so that a sharp image of the slit appear in the eyepiece the camera 's angle be adjust after focus to ensure that the crosshair be centre on the slit the holder in the kit use could be regulate at any angle relative to the slit for this experiment the holder have to be parallel to the slit to ensure normal incidence on the grate to do this the angle scale be use to rotate the eyepiece 90 degree from the central beam a mirror be place in the grate holder and the turntable be adjust such that grate reflect light from the slit directly into the crosshair on the eyepiece a the camera and the slit be exactly perpendicular it be then know that the mirror and therefore the holder be exactly 45 degree from the beam the scale could then be use to rotate the turntable 45 degree and the telescope 90degrees so that the light take a normal path through the spectrometer the angle on the scale be take a the `` zero `` for the experiment to take reading the light be pas through the slit and the telescope could be rotate such that the crosshair appear on the centre of the slit the angle difference between the `` zero `` angle and the angle on the scale give the value of 𝜃 for that peak a hydrogen lamp be position in front of the slit to obtain the hydrogen alpha wavelength for the metal use a salt be burn next to the slit allow light to pa through the slit the blowtorch be use to burn the metal salt a it burn at very high temperature with little visible light emission when use the blowtorch safety glass be use and the flame be kept far away from any person the data in this experiment be handle in python by the `` scipy `` function `` polyfit `` the `` polyfit `` function allows for a weight factor to be inputted into the parameter for every data point therefore to obtain more accurate value in the gradient the reciprocal of the uncertainty be use a weight factor the uncertainty give in the gradient by python be take a the random error in the final value for the hydrogen lamp the data in table ii be obtain when the hydrogen lamp be place at the slit red and blue line be observe through the lens the red line correspond to the hydrogen- wavelength the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m -6 to m 6 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table ii be plot in python to give the graph in fig 4. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0519  0.0005. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0519 × 1.269 × 10 −5 6 6.58 x 10^-7m fig 3. the grate spectrometer the light pas through the slit and then becomes parallel after passing through the collimator the grate the diffracts the light where it can be focus and view through the camera and eyepiece the diffraction angle can be read off the turntable if the camera/eyepiece be rotate such that the diffraction beam be centre on the crosshair the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃. to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.94 this give an absolute error of around ±6𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 658 ± 6 𝑛𝑚 this value corresponds to fraunhofer line c which have a wavelength of 656.6nm this result be strong evidence for the presence of hydrogen in the atmosphere of the sun in order to more thoroughly check for the presence of hydrogen the wavelength of hydrogen- and hydrogen- could be determine if they be found in the fraunhofer line then this would prove to a much high certainty that the fraunhofer line be cause by light absorption from element in the sun 's atmosphere and that hydrogen be one of them for the sodium chloride salt the data in table iii be obtain when the sodium chloride be burn next to the slit orange line be see through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be again approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m -4 to m 4 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table iii be plot in python to give the graph in fig 5. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0465  0.0003. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0465 × 1.269 × 10 −5 7 5.90 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.71 this give an absolute error of around ±4𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 590 ± 4 𝑛𝑚 this value corresponds to fraunhofer line d which be a doublet of wavelength of 589nm and 589.6nm this result would suggest that there be likely to be a presence of sodium in the sun 's atmosphere although the fraunhofer line have a doublet of wavelength only one be see in the spectrometer if a high resolution spectrometer be use then the presence of two line could be confirm to give the best possible chance of see two line with the apparatus use several change could be make a brighter sodium lamp could be use instead of a flame a this will produce a more reliable spectrum a bright lamp would also allow for a small slit which would decrease the overlap of the two line decrease the slit space would also spread the spectrum more make the two wavelength more distinct for the copper sulphate salt the data in table iv be obtain when the copper sulphate be burn the light emit be diffuse and not very bright the light see through the lens be very spread out meaning the collimator may not have be able to make all the light beam parallel the error from the width of the peak and the parallax error be much large than for the other three at 40 arc minute peak from m -5 to m 5 be visible through the eyepiece the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two

×10−5 8 5.33 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 4.06 this give an absolute error of around ±20𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 530 ± 20 𝑛𝑚 the range of copper wavelength do correspond to fraunhofer line e which have a wavelength of 527nm however the uncertainty in the wavelength be too high to be certain that the wavelength of copper match with this line also due to what be know about star formation it be unlikely that there be high amount of copper in the sun 's atmosphere a repeat of this experiment would require a more accurate way of get the emission spectrum of copper for example burning a more flammable salt with a large flame a more sophisticated spectrometer could also be use for the lithium salt the data in table v be obtain when the lithium salt be burn next to the slit a red line be observe through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute .. peak from m -4 to m 4 be

0.0528 × 1.269 × 10 −5 6 6.71x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.99 this give an absolute error of around ±7𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 671 ± 7 𝑛𝑚 this value do not correspond to any fraunhofer line suggest little presence of lithium in the sun 's atmosphere it would seem odd that little lithium can be found in the sun 's atmosphere a it should be more easily fuse than for example sodium although the technique give good result for hydrogen and sodium the spectrum of lithium should be checked use a different method in order to verify that the wavelength measure be correct the aim of this experiment be to determine the wavelength of the element hydrogen sodium copper and lithium and to compare these to the fraunhofer line in order to determine the chemical composition of the sun 's atmosphere the wavelength found be hydrogen -𝜆 658 ± 6 𝑛𝑚 copper -𝜆 530 ± 20 𝑛𝑚 lithium -𝜆 671 ± 7 𝑛𝑚 when compare to the fraunhofer line it be found that hydrogen and sodium be present in the solar atmosphere copper and lithium be not found in the solar atmosphere however more experimentation should be carry out before this be know for certain the result from this experiment show that it be possible to determine the chemical composition of distant object through analysis of their spectrum this could be use to check for the presence of the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃 the measurement itself and the `` zero angle `` to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in

emission of electromagnetic radiation the frequency of light emit be proportional to the energy difference between the two state a discrete range of wavelength of radiation be emit due to the quantisation of electron energy level which make up the emission spectrum atom of different element have distinct energy level therefore the emission spectrum of every element be different although the hydrogen atom contains only 1 electron that usually occupies the ground state there be many empty high energy orbitals after the electron be excite to a high energy level it drop to a low state and emits electromagnetic radiation the balmer series refers to the series of spectral emission line that be characterise by transition to energy level with principle quantum number n 2 from n 2 4 of these transition result in the emission of radiation in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum however only 3 be able to be resolve clearly in this experiment 2 the colour observe be red blue and purple in the late 19th century johann jakob balmer become the first physicist to empirically describe the appearance of spectral line johannes rydberg generalise this with the rydberg equation for all hydrogen transition not just to n 2 in 1888 3 this in turn lead to the establishment of the lyman paschen and brackett series it be important to note that the rydberg equation be a strictly empirical equation and the interpretation of the hydrogen emission spectrum in term of electronic structure be not formalise until niels bohr developed his semi-classical model of the atom in 1913 3 the semi-classical bohr model use classical mechanic to describe the circular motion of electron but they could only take certain quantise value of energy depend on orbital distance the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom yield the same result a bohr 's semi-classical approach so although the bohr model be somewhat incorrect see fig 1 it be sufficient to allow the correct relationship between quantum number and electron energy level in hydrogen to be derive an electron of mass m be assume to follow a circular orbit around the nucleus at an arbitrary radius r and speed v so the centripetal and electrostatic force can be equate 5 for a hydrogen atom with only a single proton and electron with charge of magnitude e where o be the permittivity of free space bohr postulate that the angular momentum of the electron could only take discrete value i.e it be quantise where n be the principle quantum number and h be the reduce planck 's constant by rearrange and equate equation 1 and 2 the radius of the orbit electron be give by 5 where h be planck 's constant the total energy of the electron e n be the sum of the kinetic energy and electrical potential energy which after rearrangement be give by 5 clearly the electron only take certain discrete value of energy which be proportional to the reciprocal of the principle quantum number square equation 4gives the energy level of the hydrogen atom it be important to note that bohr derive this result prior to the formal establishment of quantum mechanic which involves solve the schrödinger equation for a hydrogen atom in spherical polar co-ordinate 6 the energy difference e between the high energy level n and low energy level p be equivalent to the energy emit due to the transition planck 's law state that e hc λ where c be the speed of light and λ be the wavelength of light the relationship between λ and the principle quantum number n be therefore the rydberg constant r ∞ be define in term of fundamental constant a finally the rydberg equation be give by 4 the balmer series of wavelength be obtain when p 2. the grate spectrometer use in this experiment essentially consist of 3 component collimator grate platform and telescope light from the source first travel through the collimator which ensure that light ray be parallel before reach the diffraction grate which disperse the light the disperse spectrum be then focus by a camera lens onto the crosshair with a magnify image view with the eyepiece the grate platform and telescope could be rotate and be mount on a vernier scale the main scale be in increment of 0.5 • and the vernier scale be in arcminute this meant that the precision of the spectrometer be 1 arcminute set up the spectrometer carefully be vital to eliminate systematic error in diffraction angle and to produce a clear image this ensure that precise measurement could be take in order to produce the sharpest image possible • the eyepiece be carefully focus on the crosshair which be set to an x orientation • the camera lens be focus on a far away object by look out of a window • the telescope be then rotate opposite to the collimator the collimator focus be adjust without alter the camera focus such that a sharp image of the slit could be see the diffraction grate need to be exactly perpendicular to the hydrogen lamp source such that light ray from the source be collimate and that there be no path difference before passing through the grate to do this • the telescope be place directly opposite to the collimator with the grate remove such that the slit be see on the crosshair use the vernier scale on the spectroscope the telescope be rotate through 90 • and a mirror be place in the grate holder • the grate platform be adjust such that light be reflect into the eyepiece this meant that the orientation of the grate platform be 45 • from both the telescope and the collimator • the grate platform be then rotate exactly through 45 • use the vernier scale a reference so that it be exactly perpendicular to the collimator the telescope could be move around to observe a diffraction pattern when the mirror be replace by a 80 line per mm diffraction grate • the grate platform be adjust such that the grate ruling be parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope the telescope be move into the position where the crosshair coincide with the central bright maximum which appear a a mixture of the red blue and purple light the angle of the central maximum be record and use a the reference point from which the angle θ be record for each visible fringe by rotate the telescope until the crosshair align with the line the red and blue fringe be bright and fairly easy to see although they be more space out than the purple fringe the purple fringe be quite dim and several order could not be see with the telescope include order -2 -3 and +3 for the other purple fringe it be often challenge to see the crosshair against the purple so there be a great uncertainty for these reading additionally the hydrogen lamp gradually heat up and light intensity decrease which meant that it be even harder to see the already dim purple fringe when the lamp be close to overheat the lamp be place very close to the slit so the effect of other light source be negligible all the order that could be see clearly be record for all the colour from -4 to +5 for red -5 to +7 for blue and -5 to +5 for purple exclude the miss order a state before the precision of the spectrometer be 1 arcminute however there be a variation in reading for the vernier scale each reading be therefore repeat twice with the average value take a the angle the uncertainty be take to be the standard error of the mean it be found that the provide diffraction grate have a different number of line per millimeter than be indicate by the supplier approximately 78.8 lines/mm 4 this value be use to calculate the slit separation d. by plot a graph of dsinθ against order m for each of the colour the wavelength of the light emit during each transition could be determine by find the gradient use equation 4 the theoretical energy value of each energy level can be deduce and compare to the experimental value which be calculate by inputting the measure wavelength into planck 's law the theoretical energy emit be calculate from table 1. have identify which transition each wavelength of light correspond to the reciprocal of the wavelength be plot against 1 n 2 − 1 p 2 where p 2 due to it be from the balmer series from the rydberg equation 8 the magnitude of the gradient be equal to the rydberg constant the absolute value of the gradient be 1.099 ± 0.010 × 10 7 m −1 from equation 7 the theoretical value of the rydberg constant be 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 meaning that the experimentally determine value be within 0.25 of the true value a grate spectrometer be use to observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen 3 balmer series transition correspond to light emit in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum red blue and purple fringe be observe by measure the angle of the fringe relative to the central bright maximum their wavelength be able to be determine a well a the energy change due to the transition due to the high precision of the instrument accurate and precise value be obtain for the wavelength by use the rydberg equation and plot the graph of the reciprocal of the wavelength against the difference between the reciprocal of the square of the 2 electron energy level that be transition between a highly accurate value of the rydberg constant be calculate 1.099 ± 0.010 × 10 7 m −1 within 0.25 of the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m −1,extended,bal
74,GS_BPP712_Redacted,the rydberg constant relates the wavelength of a photon emit by an electron to the electron jump from a high to a low energy shell in order to obtain it value experimentally the light emit by a hydrogen lamp be diffract and the observable spectral line be compare to their correspond electron jump the result be r∞ 11000000 ± 26000m −1 which be large than the agree value by 0.249 i n 1888 a formula describe the wavelength of emit light from hydrogen like element be determine empirically by the swedish physicist johannes rydberg it incorporate a constant call the rydberg constant r ∞ with a value of 10973731.6m −1 ref 1 25 year later the rutherford-bohr atom model be publish and r ∞ be derive from more fundamental constant to determine the value of the rydberg constant experimentally we inspect spectral line create by hydrogen with a grate spectrometer simultaneously the formula relate the wavelength to the electron energy shell jump rydberg formula be test for validity accord to huygen 's principle a light wave encounter a grate start create new circular wave these then interfere with each other and create observable maximum and minimum two adjacent slit in a grate form a double slit it can be therefore use a a simplify model fig 1 fig 1. a planar light beam encounter a double slit and create two circular wave every blue line corresponds to a crest wavefront the distance between two adjacent line be therefore equal to the wavelength λ. the red line represent a sample of the create maximum by interference s 1 and s 2 be path that light have to travel from each slit to create a maximum a maximum can only be create if two crest interfere with each other thus s 1 and s 2 have to be multiple of the wavelength in a grate the distance between two adjacent slit d be very small when compare to s 1 and s 2 thus it might be assume that the two path be parallel fig 2 a the difference in θ between them be negligible a forward travel light wave can be described a ψ e i ωt−kx where k be define to be the wave vector and ω the wave angular frequency assume that x be in the direction of the two diffract beam then the ray in fig 2 can be define a 1 where 1 represent the amplitude with respect to location of beam 1 and 2 represent beam 2 by incorporate the additional distance of d sin θ in order to form a maximum the two wave must interfere with their crest so that the phase difference of the two wavefunctions should be a multiple m of their wavelength λ mλ arg ψ 2 − arg ψ 1 and thus for the order number m ... −2 −1 0 1 2 ... the angle θ for each create maximum be therefore only dependent on the slit width and the wavelength of the diffract light because the inspect light might consist of several wavelength their interference pattern might overlap reduce d prevents this a θ would increase for small value the most suitable atom model to obtain the rydberg constant r ∞ be the bohr model accord to which electron orbit around a positively charge and very heavy nucleus whilst be on a specific energy shell fig 3 the result centrifugal force f cent be then equal and opposite to the attractive coulomb force f coul so that the electron stay in it orbit those electron be able to move from high to low energy shell by emit energy in the form of photon and move to high energy shell by gain energy 2 the far the shell from the nucleus the more energy the orbit electron have fig 3 an equation for the wavelength of an emit photon by an electron jumping from a shell n to a shell p can be derive by use a force ansatz so that f cent f coul and thus − where z be the number of proton in the nucleus and k 1 4π 0 thus v n and r n be the velocity and radius of the electron 's movement on the n'th energy shell and m e be the electron mass this result in accord to bohr the angular momentum of every electron can be described a l n h 2π where h represent planck 's constant this be equal to the product of the electron 's moment of inertia and it angular frequency n h 2π m e r 2 n vn rn thus by substitute equation 5 into 4 r n can be define a 6 in order to determine the total energy of an electron on the nth shell e n it kinetic and potential energy need to be add the potential energy e p ot be equal to the integral from r n to ∞ over f coul with respect to r. thus rn the kinetic energy e kin can be found by divide equation 4 by 2 and so e kin kz e 2 2rn hence 2r n so if an electron jump from the n'th shell onto the p'th shell it release energy of ∆e −kz e 2 2rn − −kz e 2 2rp by substitute equation 6 the release energy be described a the energy of a photon be give by e p h hf h c λ where c be the speed of light f be the photon 's frequency and λ be the photon 's wavelength due to energy conservation e p h ∆e thus where r ∞ denotes the rydberg constant hydrogen have only one proton in it nucleus z 1 hence a hydrogen lamp creates an electrostatic field which excites electron from the hydrogen and increase their kinetic energy those electron then lose their additional energy and jump to low energy shell by emit a photon only some jump create visible wavelength which be know a the balmer series fig 5 the setup be first adjust with a sodium lamp so that the collimator the grate and the telescope ax be align for θ 0 180 o where m 0 which have to be then subtract from every measurement of the diffraction angle additionally m and θ be define to be positive in the direction up from m 0 fig 5 and negative in the opposite direction the hydrogen lamp be place a close to the slit a possible to minimise the effect of ambient light a grate with 300 line per 1mm be chosen for the experiment a accord to equation 3 the high the density of slit the easy it be to distinguish two close line from each other however a grate with a high line density could not be use a θ be become too large to be properly measure and the observe spectral line to faint at m 0 a pink/violet line could be observe fig 6a this be a combination of all the other observable colour furthermore dark blue fig 6b turquoise fig 6c and red fig 6d spectral line be observe also a very faint purple line be see but it be to faint to be record and be therefore exclude from measurement preliminary all three observe colour seem to fit into the balmer series see section iib the edge of those line be perceive a much sharper by our eye the blurriness in fig 6 be a result of bad camera quality and therefore do not affect the actual measurement quality accord to equation 3 θ be approximately proportional to λ for small value so the far a spectral line be away from m 0 the large be it wavelength therefore the correspond photon have less energy a e p h h c λ simultaneously the wavelength for each colour be determine by plot m against sin θ fig 7 a linear regression be the best approximation for the collect data for all data point intercept the regression line with their errorbars so small that not visible in graph thus equation 3 be corroborate and the slope of the linear regession be then equal to d λ where d 1mm 300 the wavelength be therefore the product of the correspond slope and 1mm 300 accord to the spectrum of visible light these wavelength roughly correspond to the observe colour in fig 6 and also to the colour emit in the balmer series fig 4 have value of λ and correspond n equation 8 can be use to determine r ∞ so λ −1 should be proportional to − 1 n 2 − 1 p 2 where p 2 and the slope would be then equal to r ∞ fig 8 the three data point align so that a justified linear regression can be conduct the result function have a y-intercept of 5700 ± 4800m −1 it should however go through the origin in order to show proportionality it value be dominate by the scale use for the y-axis the intercept can be thus neglect and a direct proportionality between the two ax can be assume a a result equation 8 be verify the slope of the function be then equal to the rydberg constant a built in vernier scale be use to measure the angle θ whose small unit be 1 arcminute 1 60 o hence the uncertainty of the measure angle be half of it σ θ 1 120 o however the observe spectral line have a certain width and the cross wire be aim at their estimate middle but this width increase the uncertainty of θ fig 9 in order to fig 9. representation of the measurement of a red spectral line on the left-hand side the cross wire be aim at the estimate middle to obtain θ. on the right-hand side the cross wire be aim at each side of the spectral line to determine ∆θ calculate the correspond error the angle of both edge of the spectral line be measure and ∆θ be then calculate for every colour for every m. the measurement error of 1 120 o be incorported a a measurement error into the calculation ∆θ be then divide by 2 a the deviation from the centre of the line can be at most only half of it width the measurement error of each possible deviation from the centre be then add to the value to simulate the large deviation this be then define a the new σ θ all value in the appendix this uncertainty of θ also incorporates the diffraction cause be the collimator and the telescope a both use glass lens the slit be well align with the lens for the centre of all wavelength for m 0 be at θ 180 o hence the lens diffraction only influence the width of the strip and not their location however for certainty all the measurement be take quickly so that the refractive index of the surround air would not change significantly due to temperature or pressure change additionally no ambient light be shin whilst the measurement be take to increase the visibility of the spectral line in fig 7 all linear regression have a small negative yintercept but they all should be theoretically equal to zero thus a systematical error might have occur low the measure value of θ. the most probable origin of this error be an inaccurate calibration of the spectrometer small value of λ would lead then to large value of λ −1 and would thus explain the positive intercept in fig 8. the official value of r ∞ be 10973731.6m −1 ref 1 our experimentally determine value be however 11000000 ± 26000m −1 the official number do therefore not lie within the value of the obtain r ∞ it be however very close a it be small by only 0.239 hence the official value of the rydberg constant be not verify by this experiment the result be very precise with an uncertainty of only 0.236 however the slope obtain from fig 8 be strongly influence by random error a only three point define the linear regression hence the validity of the result would be increase by inspect a broader span of emit photon wavelength the aim of this experiment be to determine r ∞ with a spectrometer by inspect the balmer series emit by a hydrogen lamp with a result of r ∞ 11000000±26000m −1 we be able to proof the rydberg formula however the official value of the constant be not verify the grate spectrometer be a very precise measurement technique a the final uncertainty be very small it be however prone to random error the observable spectrum be limited to the visible spectrum of electromagnetic wave between 390 and 700nm a change of the measurement device would allow gathering more data and thus the validity of the result would increase,expert,the
75,GS_WHP087_Redacted,this experiment be conduct to determine the rydberg constant by use the emission spectrum of hydrogen lamp in the experiment light emit by hydrogen lamp be diffract into bright fringe and be observe through a grate spectrometer fringe with three colour red green and purple be observe for each colour the diffraction angle and order of maximum be measure and be use to determine the wavelength wavelength of each colour and their correspondent initial and final energy level be then use to calculate the rydberg constant the value calculate with the red light be 11161664.7±40600.2𝑚 −1 the value calculate with the blue light be 10956139.2±51453.5𝑚 −1 and the value calculate with the purple light be 10773444.4±12520.1𝑚 −1 atom emit light with discrete wavelength due to electron movement but light be mixed so that color can not be observe through a diffraction grate light with different wave length have different diffraction angle which separate light by their wavelength so that wavelength of emit light can be measure wavelength of light emit by an atom be call emission spectrum it be in 1855 that the emission spectrum line of hydrogen atom be precisely measure by j. j. balmer and lyman it be found to be regular and conclude into an equation call balmer equation by the former the equation be an empirical formula which show that the wavelength of the emit light by a hydrogen atom be related to 1/𝑛 2 where n be any positive integer great than 3. and the equation be developed by rydberg into rydberg equation which be consist with a wider range of spectrum over next few decade and rydberg constant be therefore introduce to fit the equation but the meaning of the equation the constant and the emission spectrum still could not be interpret until the establishment of bohr model of hydrogen atom bohr explain that the emission of light be due to the transition of electron 's energy level and the energy of emit photon equal to the change in electron 's potential energy since energy level of electron be quantize the atom can only release light with certain wave length and the rydberg constant be later deduce by bohr use his model and plank 's photon theory with 0.05 percent of error which be interpret because of the atom movement in this experiment emission spectrum of hydrogen lamp be measure through grate spectrometer and the rydberg constant be calculate figure 1 1 spectrometer theory with light passing through grate in spectrometer principal maximum occurs when light that go through all slit have instruction interference which be to say that light passing through every slit have a phase difference of 2nπ with the light passing through the neighbor slit where n be any integer δ𝜙 2𝑛𝜋 1 where δ𝜙 be phase difference between two light wave which can be also express a δ𝑟 be denote a path difference and 𝜆 be wavelength the path difference can be farther express a where d be the separation between slit which be where n be number of slit per meter and 𝜃 be diffraction angle therefore and n represent order of maximum which be to say from equation 5 it can be told that light with different wavelength have different diffraction angle therefore a mixture of light with different wavelength can be separate through a grate and wavelength of each light can be determine by the linear relationship between diffraction angle and order of maximum a mention before rydberg equation describes the relationship between the wavelength of emit light and the correspondent change in energy level in hydrogen atom accord to bohr 's equation for energy level the total energy of an electron be and plank 's photon theory the photon energy be where 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of electron e be charge per electron and n be energy level of the electron the photon energy should equal the change in energy level therefore where n and p be final and initial energy level the equation can be rearrange into which mean where r be call rydberg constant figure 2 2 grate spectrometer the grate spectrometer be set up and calibrate by several step the telescope be first focus around 1 meter far the adjustable slit be then narrow a sodium lamp be place in front of the slit the telescope be adjust so that the crosswire inside the telescope be align with the slit the telescope then be turn exactly 90 degree by the vernier angular scale and clamped and a diffraction grate with 78.8 line per meter be set on the turn table the turntable be rotate until the crosswire of the telescope be again align with the fringe of the slit from the reflection of the grate then the telescope be unclamped and rotate exactly 90 degree back the turn table be rotate exactly 45 degree and clamped the reading on vernier scale be record a central angle 𝜃 0 which for this experiment be 96.17 degree turn the telescope the fringe of sodium lamp light can then be observe through the telescope the sodium lamp be then replace by a hydrogen lamp turn the telescope red green and purple fringe be observe for fringe with each color the rotation angle show by the vernier meter and order of maximum be record and for each fringe the width be measure a the error there should be more color but be unobservable 1. for date of each color the fit line between order of maximum and the sine function of change in rotation angle to central angle 𝜃

76,GS_SUY577_Redacted,the rydberg constant be a constant which appear in atomic physic it be use when describe the wavelength of light in numerous spectral line series in a hydrogen atom particularly the balmer series although the value of this constant have be determine before we would like to provide some experimental validation for this ultimately our setup make use of a diffraction grate and spectrometer and by the principle of superposition generates a fringe pattern which we can observe position of principle maximum be related to the wavelength of the emit light and alongside knowledge of the balmer series a value for the rydberg constant can be calculate the value we obtain from this experiment to three significant figure be 1.10x10 7 m -1 with a statistical error of approximately 2.6 systematic error contribution will be discus in detail in section 4. however we attempt to control these in our experiment and this be confirm in our result a it be close to the true value of the rydberg constant the rydberg constant be first introduce a a proportionality constant relate the wavelength of light from the atomic line spectrum of a hydrogen atom to the quantum number correspond to the energy level that the electron transition this be call the rydberg formula and can also be apply to heavier element niels bohr show that the rydberg constant could be express in term of more fundamental constant 1 where me be the rest mass of the electron e be the elementary charge on the electron εo be the permittivity of free space h be the planck constant and c be the speed of light in a vacuum to determine a value for the rydberg constant our experimental setup u a spectrometer a spectrometer be a device which show light intensity depend on it wavelength or frequency the incident light be spread out by a diffraction grate but a prism can also be use both result in a spectrum but this will be discus far in section 2. an article from 1988 title 'precision measurement of the rydberg constant by d h mcintyre and t w hänsch suggest that the accuracy of the rydberg constant have be improve beyond 1 part in 10 9 nowadays the constant have an uncertainty of less than 7 part in 10 12 1 we do n't expect to achieve this level of accuracy in our experiment but it give an idea of how well-determined this constant be the energy of an electron which be bound in a hydrogen atom can only take discrete value this be one way of say that the electron 's energy be 'quantised when an electron fall from a high energy state to a low energy state a photon of energy equivalent to difference in energy state be release this photon also have an associate wavelength the rydberg formula be one illustration of this and be show in equation 1 2 where λ be the wavelength of the emit light r∞ be the rydberg constant for hydrogen n and p be integer which represent the low and upper energy state respectively this experiment be concerned with electron which fall to the n=2 energy state a some of the emit light have wavelength within the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum this be know a the balmer series and be show in figure 2.1 spectrum of a hydrogen atom in the balmer series 3 red appear furthest to the right and then colour change from aqua to blue to violet a you move towards the left the wavelength of the light decrease but the frequency increase until you reach ultraviolet which be invisible to the naked eye the spectrometer in our experiment be couple with a diffraction grate but a mention earlier a prism may also be use the prism separate the light because different frequency of light be refract by different amount this be call dispersion our diffraction grate act like many equally space slit we know from young 's double-slit experiment that when light pas through two slit an interference pattern be form the light interferes a it pas through the slit because of the path difference and result phase difference of two light ray position of maximum intensity occur when the phase difference of the two ray be an integer multiple of 2π it can be show that position of principle maximum for many slit be described by equation 2 where d be the separation of the slit θ be the angle from the centre to desire maximum m be an integer and represent the order number and λ be the wavelength of the emit light if for example we be interested in position of principle minimum equation 2 would be modify such that the left-hand side would be multiply by n the total number of slit firstly the optical spectrometer have to be set up such that result could be take accurately and reliably this involve ensure that the spectrometer be align such that light hit the diffraction grate at exactly 90º if this be n't the case we would see a very messy fringe pattern it be also necessary to make sure that the eyepiece of the spectrometer be focus on the crosshair and that the camera lens be focus on a distant object the crosshair be much easy to see when be use diagonally these be important because the image need to be clear free from parallax and at a comfortable view distance the experimental setup be show in figure 3.1 on the follow page powerpoint to display the experimental setup of the spectrometer the hydrogen lamp serf a the light source the slit limit the amount of light into the spectrometer the collimator be necessary because it make ray parallel before they enter the diffraction grate the camera lens focus the light ray create an image which be then view through the eyepiece by an observer a diffraction grate of 80 ± 2 line per mm be use to generate the fringe pattern the fringe pattern be observe use the eyepiece and the central maximum be locate this angle be record and take a the zeroth order the main scale on the spectrometer be divide into half of a degree and the vernier scale read in arc minute the angle θ be record a a function of the order m for each transition wavelength result be take either side of the central maximum and multiple result be take to improve reliability a measurement can be take very quickly since the angle θ be measure a a function of order m equation 2 implies that a graph of m versus sin θ should be plot for each transition wavelength this will result in a straight line with a gradient λ/d this be show in figure 4.1 a see in this figure the relationship between m and sin θ be linear for both red and blue light a expect we can see that the slope for blue light be not a steep a the slope for red light we also expect to see this a blue light have a shorter wavelength than red light vertical error bar be quite small this implies a small statistical uncertainty in our gradient and this be confirm when the wavelength with an associate error be calculate for each colour for blue light we determine the wavelength to be 488 ± 12.3 nm for red light the wavelength be determine a 650 ± 17.9 nm with the wavelength know equation 2 can be use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant blue light appear on the emission spectrum because of electron drop down from the n=4 energy state to the n=2 energy state red light appear on the emission spectrum a a result of electron drop down from the n=3 energy state to the n=2 energy state plug these value into equation 2 give u an average value of the rydberg constant a 1.10x10 7 ± 2.90x10 5 m -1 however this do n't account for any systematic error which we may have encounter in the experiment it do minimise random error such a misread the scale on the spectrometer in the low light condition source of systematic error which could have affected our result might include misalignment of the spectrometer position of our hydrogen lamp air pressure humidity and unwanted background light we attempt to control most of these factor throughout the course of our experiment the spectrometer alignment be an important part of the setup and it take u much longer to do it compare with record the data we each try to set up the spectrometer we also ask the demonstrator to check our setup before proceed because we realise that the spectrometer must be align correctly to achieve accurate and reliable result our hydrogen lamp be position a close to the slit a possible and we do n't move it throughout the experiment we come to the logical conclusion that since we perform the experiment in the same environment throughout the air pressure and humidity would remain fairly constant throughout and would have a negligible effect on our result we also try to limit any background light ensure desk lamp be switch off and the door be close in the dark room we estimate that these factor would be much more noticeable if we be intend to record the rydberg constant to a much high number of significant figure for three significant figure we estimate that these systematic error altogether would contribute about 0.01 to the total error our statistical error be much high than this at the sig fig scale we be measure at and so this can effectively be ignore to conclude the aim of this experiment be to provide some empirical evidence for the current accepted value of the rydberg constant the experimental setup involve an optical spectrometer together with a diffraction grate to display the typical emission spectrum for hydrogen with knowledge of the rydberg formula and balmer series a value for the rydberg constant can be determine for a know wavelength of light we determine the rydberg constant to be 1.10x10 7 with an approximate 2.6 statistical error however we felt that this experiment do take a while to setup a the optical spectrometer have to be align correctly to produce accurate and reliable result once the spectrometer be align it be relatively easy to record measurement unfortunately we struggle to see any other colour aside from blue and red such a violet and if we could see them the intensity be very low perhaps a spectrometer with a high resolution would enable u to see these other colour more clearly we understand from our research that the rydberg formula can be apply to heavier element and a such perhaps this experiment could be extend to other element aside from hydrogen result in a more complicate emission spectrum,extended,bal
77,GS_TKK454_Redacted,measurement of angle of multiple colour wavelength and order of emission line of hydrogen from the balmer series be take use a grate spectrometer this data be put into a straight line plot which allow the calculation of wavelength which meant a determination of rydberg 's constant r ∞ be calculate and compare to the accepted value through two set of separate data we arrive at two mean value of r ∞ the best value be 10552000±250400 m −1 which carry an uncertainty of 2.4 and an error on the real value of r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 of 3.9 the rydberg equation be a general form of the balmer equation found in 1885 by johann balmer through trial and error and link the wavelength of emission line in the visible hydrogen spectrum and the electron energy level change that produce them 1 the formula give by balmer be a special case for the light emit by hydrogen that fall in the visible spectrum when atom become excite their electron can undergo transition between discrete energy level these energy change result in the emission of discrete energy packet photon which have wavelength correspond to the change in energy the range of possible change of energy level in an atom produce an analogous range of wavelength of photon call a characteristic emission spectrum these spectrum can be use to identify element through spectroscopy however in this experiment a know element will be use hydrogen and the position of it emission line measure in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to take measurement of angular position of spectral line on an arcminute resolution which be a very high resolution and good for make calculation to many significant figure because of the nature of a diffraction grate multiple 'orders or repeat of each colour of emission line can be observe use the spectrometer relationship between wavelength and angular position give in 2 we can plot a straight line graph from which the wavelength of each emission line can be calculate each different wavelength allows a separate calculation of r ∞ and compare our result to the real value allows a benchmark of our experimental technique to be make against high-level experimental determination a grate of 80 l.p.m be use instead for our first set of data take on january 23 2018 but then a second set of data be take january 30 2018 with a 300 l.p.m for comparison a hydrogen lamp be use a our source for our data a it give three well-defined visible spectral line but a sodium lamp be use in the setup of the apparatus a sodium lamp can be left on for longer without overheat the rydberg empirical equation be where n be the initial energy level of an electron in the atom n ∈ n and p be the final energy state p ∈ n p n. in the case of the balmer series p 2. this equation be relevant to this experiment a it describes the visible wavelength produce by hydrogen the balmer series be simply the result of the transition of electron from the n th state to the 2 nd low state in a diffraction grate light diffracts through microscopic slit of which there be of the order of 10 or 100 in a millimetre this cause the diffract light wave to interfere with each other and create light and dark fringe this allows the light that be generate by our source to be amplify into bright peak and mean that each wavelength be repeat in several fringe or 'orders figure 1 indicates figure 1 the path of monochromatic light wave diffract through a grate source 2 the path difference of wave that be travel through separate slit the line ac the condition that these wave must fulfill in order to constructively interfere and make a bright fringe be that they must be in phase at the point of observation this mean that the path difference must be some integer multiple of wavelength which lead to the equation where m be order such that m ∈ n and d be line space in metre this show that a graph of sin θ against m should be a straight line of gradient λ d a d be a constant calculate from where α be the number of line per millimetre in the diffraction grate α ∈ 78.8 300 α 78.8 be for the 80 l.p.m diffraction grate 2 we can calculate λ from this value of λ can be use in balmer 's equation subsituting the know value for n and p for each colour give in table 1 r ∞ can be calculate use the equation 5 which will allow u to make a comparison to the accepted value and hence comment on the accuracy of the experiment the spectrometer be calibrate carefully in order to obtain sharp spectral line across the order in the plane of the eyepiece to make measurement a accurate a possible figure 2 and 3 show clearly the adjustment mechanism that be use to calibrate the spectrometer when look through the eyepiece the observer see a crosshair over the image which be use to make fine visual alignment a show in figure 4. the eyepiece be focus onto the crosshair so it be sharp the telescope lens be then focus by position it near a window and adjust the objective lens until very distant object distance 10m become resolve this be to focus the camera on a point at infinty or close to so that parallax in the eyepiece be minimise without a diffraction grate in place the sodium light source be position in front of the slit and the telescope be move until the crosshair overlap the single emission line from the collimator indicate that the telescope and collimator be parallel it be at this point necessary to adjust the slit so that the line be a narrow a possible whilst still visible to make the position accurate when adjust the telescope position large movement be make by unscrew the fasten screw a label in figure 2 when the telescope be in approx-imately the right place the screw be fasten again and the fine adjustment screw be use to align the crosshair perfectly at this parallel position the reading on the vernier scale be take the angular vernier scale do not provide an absolute angle from a reference point but be instead use for relative measurement this measure value from the vernier scale become our 0 • reference point this reference point be use to rotate the telescope in the horizontal plane 90 • relative to the reference point and hence the collimator a mirror be then insert into the grate holder and the grate table be rotate without affect the vernier scale measurement such that a reflection of the light from the collimator be visible and align with the crosshair base on the principle of reflect light angle of incidence be equal to the angle of reflection this told u that the grate be orient at 45 • to both the collimator and the telescope and the table could then be rotate exactly 45 • use the vernier scale it be then geometrically sound to reason that the grate be in the plane perpendicular to the collimator within a tolerance dictate by the uncertainty on the vernier scale reading which be discus in 6. with the grate stand perpendicular to the collimator the grate table be lock in place to avoid the need for recalibration the mirror be then replace with the grate of choice 80 l.p.m then 300 l.p.m and the table adjustment screw be use to adjust the height and plane orientation of the table until the spectral line from the diffraction grate be in the plane of the telescope across a wide range of angle if the table be not align properly then measurement at high order would be make more difficult and less accurate a they would be in a plane not parallel to the horizontal this be show in figure 5. figure 5 a skew line which would be typical if the table be not correctly adjust this would be more visible at high order it be clear to see that it be not possible to easily define where a measurement should be take in this instance this setup process be follow closely from the lab manual 6 during the first attempt at the setup process the table alignment step be not follow properly a 300 l.p.m grate be be use a it be advise that this would yield clear order for each colour which would reduce confusion however before a full set of data could be take two thing be apparent primarily that the intensity of the spectral line be diminshing very quickly a order increase and so few data point could be take for each colour secondly that the spectral line be deviate from the horizontal this orientation problem be correct and then the grate switch in order to take more data point the main calculation of uncertainty do on the data come from the calculation of uncertainty on the gradient of our graph which be do computationally from the standard deviation of the data point around the regression line in python 's scipy package more data point make the value of deviation more reliable hence why the 80 l.p.m grate be eventually chosen the downside of this be that the order be not a well define -lines of very different order could be found very close to one another this be easily manage by keep good track of the order of each line a the measurement be be take for the 80 l.p.m grate a set of data be take by rotate the telescope through anticlockwise from the 0 • position a this reduce the reading on the vernier scale the absolute angle be negative which meant that the value of order that data be be take for be also negative a the telescope be move through the position and colour of each spectral line observe be record alongside it order this be do until the spectral line diminish to a point where accurate determination of position or order be no longer possible from this position the telescope be swept through again take a set of repeat measurement on the way back to 0 • for the sake of time measurement be not take for order ≥ 1. the raw measurement of angle be record and from them our sero position value be subtract to obtain a correct absolute value of angular position our zero position value be 220 • 10 or 220.17 • 2d.p the 300 l.p.m grate be use to generate a second set of data after the first experiment be perform this be to compare the value of r ∞ for each grate in order to combat the rapid diminish of order that be face with the grate measurement of order both less than and great than 0 be take whereas only order 0 be take with the 80 l.p.m grate repeat be also take for each value measure use the 300 l.p.m this meant there be enough data point to compute error calculation with however there be still distinctly few data point for each colour a discus in 3 each measurement carry an estimate ±3 or 0.05 • uncertainty a discus in 2 the graph of sin θ against order m yield a gradient of λ d therefore for each grate a linear plot be generate for each colour this allow an analysis of the gradient to be perform and λ calculate which in turn allow r ∞ to be calculate for each wavelength use equation 5. in analysis the graph plot for the measurement of angle and order take show a strong linear trend a expect however by inspection it be clear that the result already be not perfect table 2 7 show the wavelength of the line that we see in the hydrogen emission spectrum colour wavelength nm red 656 blue 434 purple 410 it be therefore clear that red should have a steeper line than the other two a gradient ∝ λ. however figure 6 show red be almost parallel to the line for purple the value of λ obtain from the gradient in figure 6 use equation 4 with d 1.27 × 10 −5 from equation 3 be thus present in the table below colour wavelength nm purple 600 ± 57 blue 485.9 ± 1.5 red 830 ± 151 these value be far from accurate and in the case of red and purple they be not precise either the value of wavelength for red be outside the visible range and the value for purple be close to the know value of red wavelength where it should be much low which indicates that there have be some error in the take of data when the measurement be be take the blue spectral line be the easy to see clearly and many more order be visible this be most likely why the value of position for blue be the best because the deviation around blue be the small it error have be quote to 2 d.p a there be great reason to say that it value be know to a high place of accuracy these value and their associate uncertainty be then use in equation 5 to calculate their respective value of rydberg 's constant these be give below colour r ∞ /m −1 purple 7490000 ± 710000 blue 9800000 ± 30250 red 8700000 ± 1580000 these value give a mean value of r ∞ 8660000±1730000 m −1 the discussion of uncertainty for both wavelength and r ∞ be give in 6. use the data from the 300 l.p.m grate another graph be plot similar to before see in figure 7. figure 7 figure 7 the graph for the 300 l.p.m grate show a much more intuitive set of data with the exception of the value of purple at order -3 which fall below the line but carry a large error and so do not influence the line heavily the line all show strong linearity it be also immediately clear that the purple and blue line be close in gradient and that red be much steeper a we expect previously but be not confirm by figure 6. the value of wavelength for this set of data be give in the below table colour wavelength nm purple 434 ± 3 blue 459 ± 10 red 659 ± 5 this show a remark improvement in the likeness of the data to the expect value for wavelength the uncertainty be also more consistent although interestingly blue carry a large uncertainty than the others contrary to the previous set of data these value of wavelength lead to the follow value of rydberg 's constant the uncertainty related to measurement on the vernier scale be subject to estimation a one issue with the precision of the experiement be that it be difficult to say to which arcminute the scale be reading to often multiple line would look close to be align which make the reading hard to give to a fine accuracy an estimate uncertainty of ±3 will be use for angle measurement where denotes arcminute or 1 60 th of a degree a this cover the number of line either side of a give reading that could have also be read a align or close to align this uncertainty of ±0.05 • be include in the calculation of the errorbars on the graph these errorbars be calculate use interpolation of the sine function for each order the error on sin θ σ be calculate use where θ be the mean value of θ take from the two repeat of each point σ θ be the standard deviation on θ calculate use the standard deviation formula on the two datapoints for each order and σ v ernier be the measurement uncertainty from the vernier scale reading σ v ernier 0.05 • all the value be transform to radian before the sine function be use in 6 and 7 a represent the minimum possible estimation of θ i.e the low bound and b represent the upper bound by find half the difference between the sine of a and b we be interpolate linearly in the boundary between the upper and low bound of angle although sine be not a linear function this be still a good estimate a the range between bound for each angle be very small and so the function can be approximate a a linear segment in this interval with negligible error this be prove by the fact that the errorbars on the graph be very small in most case invisible even though the scipy.errorbar function be use to plot them a the errorbars be so small yet the variation of the point around the line be so large it would be irresponsible to say that they be the best estimation of error for λ. a far well estimation of error be the measure of spread around the regression line this be calculate use scipy.polyfit which generates fit parameter for the regression line and also return a covariance matrix c. each point on the line be give a weight w such that w 1 σ which mean the uncertainty from the vernier measurement and the deviation of the repeat value be propogated appropriately the small the error the great the line lean toward that point the uncertainty on the gradient be found use which be the most comprehensive measurement of error on gradient and therefore λ. λ be calculate from the gradient use equation 6. it be reasonable to assume that there be no significant error on d due to manufacturing to estimate the uncertainty on our value of rydberg 's constant the general formula for uncertainty of any function z x a give by which in the case of equation 5gives the mean value of r ∞ calculcated in 5.1 and 5.2 be calculate use the arithmetic mean and the uncertainty value found from add all the other uncertainty in quadrature the mean value of r ∞ 8660000±1730000 m −1 and 10552000± 250400 m −1 both compare differently to the know value of r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 2 the first value have an error of 22 and an uncertainty of 20 both of which be large and indicate that the experimental technique use be flaw it be most likely that the setup be perform incorrectly which lead to a systematic error in the reading of the angle there could also have be an exaggerated effect of random error from reading the vernier scale due to inexperience with reading that type of scale the second value from the 300 l.p.m grate be notably the well value it carry a 3.9 error on the real value which be far more accurate to the level expect of the apparatus use the uncertainty on the value itself be 2.4 which be again a reasonable level of precision that one would expect from the use of a spectrometer which be inherently a precise piece of equipment the majority of this error would have be random and originates from the vernier scale reading a before but there be clearly less systematic error affect this repeat data from the set of data for the 300 l.p.m grate the value for r ∞ calculate from the red wavelength be the most accurate value and carry less uncertainty than the mean a it be the value correspond to the blue wavelength that be responsible for most uncertainty on the mean value from this value of r ∞ 10926000 ± 84200 m −1 the error on the know value be only 0.4 and the uncertainty be 0.8 and so unlike the two mean value the real value of rydberg 's constant fall within the uncertainty of this value this be extremely accurate and although the measurement equipment use have the potential to be very accurate it be debateable whether this value be representative of the experiment give that it be the only value that be this accurate and precise in conclusion the final value of rydberg 's constant from this experiment shall be quote a the mean value r ∞ 10552000 ± 250400 m −1 a it take into account the majority of datapoints take and give a good level of error and uncertainty and be clearly less systematically erroneous than the mean value

78,GS_TFY667_Redacted,"this project investigates the measurement of wavelength in the hydrogen spectrum use a grate spectrometer in order to ultimately deduce a value for the rydberg constant wavelength be measure for blue aqua and red emission line which be calculate to be 434.8 ± 2.4 nm 486.9 ± 1.3 nm and 659.6 ± 2.2 nm respectively with their true value be 434nm 486nm and 656nm 1 the rydberg constant be then deduce to be 10940685.2 ± 12293.4 m −1 which be accurate with a 0.3 error compare to the theoretical value of 10973731.6 m −1 2 spectrometer be use to examine the spectrum of light such that wavelength of light over the range of continuous absorption or emission line spectrum can be calculate with emission line spectrum emit by hot gas spectroscopy can be use to measure the width of the spectral line in order to determine property of the emit gas spectrometer be incredibly accurate device that can be use to study flame star plasma and semiconductor 2 for example in astronomy they can be use to measure the age rotational velocity and recessional velocity of interstellar object 3 the aim of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant use this spectroscopy technique involve a grate spectrometer on the emission line spectrum produce by hydrogen gas this be a physical constant that appear in the balmer formula for the spectral line of a hydrogen atom in order to do this the wavelength of the emission line be calculate by measure their diffraction angle after passing through the grate spectrometer emission line spectrum occur when hot gas emit spectrum and be present a a few define line of different colour which correspond to the specific wavelength of light emit by the gas these spectral line be unique to each element so can be use to identify them 1 for example the emission line spectrum for hydrogen can be show in fig 1. when an electron in an atom receives energy for example from heat the electron move to a high energy level cause the atom to be in an excite state however this state be unstable a atom be most stable in their ground state so the electron return to a low energy level by release it excess energy a a photon in the case of a hydrogen atom fig 1. the emission line spectrum produce by hydrogen gas show the four specific wavelength emit on the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum violet blue aqua and red this be what should be view during the experiment through the spectrometer the violet line be weak so sometimes can not be see image adapt from 1 there be multiple energy state that electron transition can occur between quantum mechanic suggests that these energy level exist discretely therefore the emit photon have discrete energy and specific wavelength such that where e be the energy of the photon h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light in a vacuum and λ be the wavelength of the photon this mean the presence of spectral line can be explain by quantum mechanic 4 fig 2. possible electron transition show how they relate to the balmer and lyman series for any atom the high energy level that the electron transition from can be from any number up to infinity but it be the energy level that the electron transition to that determines the series 5 the great the energy difference between the two transition state the shorter the wavelength of the emit photon a it have more energy if the energy difference be great enough the wavelength may be too short to be in the visible spectrum so would not be detect by the spectroscope a it lie in the ultraviolet range likewise if the energy difference be very small the wavelength may be too long to be in the visible spectrum so also would not be detect by the spectroscope a it lie in the infrared range the possible energy transition for hydrogen atom that emit photon in the visible range be from high level to the second orbital energy level this transition to the second energy level be know a the balmer series this idea of energy level and electron transition can be show in fig 2. the balmer series be where electron transition to n 2 from n ≥ 3 where n be the principal quantum number or energy level of the electron 4 in hydrogen both visible light transition and ultraviolet transition form the balmer series with ultraviolet transition also form the lyman series infrared transition form the paschen and pfund series the lyman paschen and pfund series have transition from high energy level to the first third and fourth energy level respectively 6 there be four wavelength displayed in the visible light spectrum for hydrogen 410nm 434nm 486nm and 656nm which correspond to the colour violet blue aqua and red respectively 1 the other balmer line with wavelength shorter than 400nm be in the ultraviolet spectrum and be not visible therefore in order for spectral line to appear on the visible light spectrum the electron transition must emit a photon of the correct wavelength the high energy level which the electron can transition from in order to do this have the quantum number n 6. the spectrometer can be use to view these spectral line by use a lens to produce a collimate beam of light which it disperses with a grate this disperse spectrum be then focus and view with an eyepiece the component that make up the spectrometer can be show in fig 3. fig 3. schematic diagram of the spectrometer and the three main component that make it up the collimator diffraction grate and the telescope the telescope can be consider a the camera and eyepiece this show the path that light take from the source through the device to the eyepiece where the spectral line can be view 2 light from the source travel through a narrow slit where it enters the spectrometer a collimate lens in the spectrometer make the beam parallel therefore all the light ray hit the diffraction grate at the same angle of incidence where this diffract light be then focus onto a cross-hair x by a camera lens an eyepiece be use to view a magnify image of the disperse spectrum 2 the grate consists of many equally space narrow slit with the slit separation be d. the light with wavelength λ diffracts through these slit and the diffract beam interfere with each other the diffraction effect be optimal with maximum wavefront curvature when the grate space have a similar magnitude to the wavelength of the incoming ray a maximum occurs when diffract ray interfere constructively so phase difference between neighbour ray be an integer multiple n of 2π where path difference be dsinθ with θ be the diffraction angle therefore where n represent a positive or negative order number this path difference be displayed in fig 4. the wave be out of phase so interfere destructively to form point of minimum when the path difference be nλ 2 the wave be in phase so interfere constructively to form point of maximum in both case n be an even integer transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by where n be an integer represent the energy level of the initial state of the atom and p be an integer represent the energy level of the final state of the atom here due to the balmer series in hydrogen for the visible spectrum p 2 and n 3,4,5 ... a the electron drop down from a high energy level to the second energy level 2 the rydberg constant be r ∞ which have a theoretical value of 10973731.6 m −1 and can be described in term of fundamental constant where c be the speed of light m e be the mass of an electron h be planck 's constant and α be the fine constant which can be define a where 0 be the permittivity of free space firstly we have to set up the spectrometer to ensure that it be properly align and focus in this way it could be use to make accurate measurement competent of precision of under three part in ten thousand the focus ensure that there be no parallax between the image and cross wire and the telescope need to be align with the axis of the collimator the eyepiece be focus onto the cross wire so that the image be at a convenient view distance without eye strain the camera lens be then focus by view a distant object roughly 5-10 metre away through the lens and focus this object onto the cross wire we place the sodium lamp in front of the slit to illuminate it turn the light off in the room to make this more effective a sodium lamp be use a the light source for set up the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp use later for take measurement would overheat if left on for too long we adjust the collimator 's focus without modify the camera focus until the image of the slit be sharply focus onto the cross wire the clamp screw and slow-motion drive be then adjust in order to align the camera and cross wire so that the cross wire be set on the slit image the slowmotion drive allow the camera to be rotate smoothly and by precise amount we rotate the cross wire a we found that they be most easily use when marked a an x instead of a '+ we move the telescope through exactly 90 degree use the rotation drive and clamped it in position there be two scale use in order to do this precisely the main scale divide into half of a degree and the vernier scale divide into arc minute a mirror be place in the grate holder and the grate table rotate until we could see the reflect image of the slit in the eyepiece once this occur we knew that the mirror be at 45 degree to the incident beam from the collimator we use the adjustment screw under the grate table to modify the height of the image and the grate drive to set the mirror so that the slit image be precisely at the cross wire use the reading that the telescope be set at when it be 90 degree we then rotate the mirror through exactly 45 degree so that it be accurately set at 0 degree incidence to the normal we then move the telescope back 90 degree so that it be at 0 degree orientation the spectrometer be now focus and align so measurement could be take 2 the mirror be replace with a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm and the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen gas lamp through the eyepiece the emission line spectrum of hydrogen could be view a we rotate the telescope use the slow-motion drive for each transition wavelength we measure the diffraction angle θ a a function of order m for positive and negative m value from the zeroth order the reading on the scale be note at the zeroth order a the reference value which be deduct from each transition wavelength reading to get θ. reading be record in degree and then arcminute use both the scale for some wavelength we found that we could obtain more order than for others a others grow dimmer faster for example blue we manage to obtain θ and m value for blue aqua and red line but not purple line for each colour wavelength record a graph of sinθ against m could be plot from equation 3 the gradient of this graph be λ d so the wavelength of each colour spectral line could be calculate from multiply the gradient by the grate space use equation 4we calculate the rydberg constant for each wavelength then could use these to obtain an average value for the constant the result for the variation of sinθ against order m for blue spectral line be present in fig 5. the error bar be barely visible a they be so small that they may be consider negligible this be due to the precision of the spectrometer the gradient of the slope be 3.43 ± 0.0192 x 10 −2 the diffraction angle θ be a function of the reference value and the record angle both of which have an error of half an arc minute a this be half an increment on the vernier scale therefore this error be add twice in quadrature to calculate the error in θ which be propagate through use function error to calculate the error in sinθ use equation 3 the gradient multiply by the grate space be equal to λ which can be calculate to be 434.8 ± 2.4 nm have a 0.56 uncertainty the theoretical value of the wavelength for blue spectral line here be 434nm which lie within the uncertainty therefore there be only a 0.18 error in our result show that it be extremely accurate with the wavelength calculate equation 3 can be use to calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ use the balmer series n 5 for blue wavelength r ∞ be 10953123.1 ± 61473.1 m −1 this be an uncertainty of 0.56 and an error of 0.19 from the theoretical value of 10973731.6 m −1 therefore our result here be very accurate also because the theoretical value lie within the uncertainty of our calculate result the result for the variation of sinθ against order m for aqua spectral line be present in fig 6. the gradient of the slope be 3.84 ± 0.0104 x 10 −2 use this the wavelength for aqua be calculate to be 486.9 ± 1.3 nm a 0.27 uncertainty error be calculate in the same way a described for the blue wavelength this compare to the theoretical value of λ be 486nm so our result have an error of 0.19 and be thus very accurate from the balmer series n 4 for aqua wavelength so r ∞ can be calculate from this data to be 10952833.7 ± 29572.5 m −1 this be an uncertainty of 0.27 and have an error of 0.19 compare to the theoretical value this result be also very accurate due to the small percentage error and because the theoretical value lie within the uncertainty of the r ∞ we calculate in the same way a the previous two colour the wavelength for red could be calculate from the plot of sinθ against order m which be present in fig 7. the gradient of the slope be 5.2 ± 0.017 x 10 −2 this lead to the calculate wavelength to be 659.6 ± 2.2 nm which be a 0.33 uncertainty the theoretical value of λ be 656nm therefore our result have a 0.55 error which be slightly large than the error calculate in the other wavelength but be still very small thus our result be accurate use n=3 from the balmer series for red wavelength r ∞ can be calculate to be 10916098.9 ± 35895.6 m −1 this have a 0.33 uncertainty and have a 0.53 error so this result be very accurate despite have a large error than the previous value calculate for r ∞ to deduce an overall value for r ∞ for this experiment the mean of the three r ∞ value calculate for the individual wavelength on the emission line spectrum for hydrogen be take this prove to be 10940685.2 ± 12293.4 m −1 with the error calculate use standard error of the three r ∞ value this result have a 0.09 uncertainty and a 0.3 error from the theoretical value both of which be very small thus fig 7. the result for sinθ plot against the order m for the red spectral line observe with the spectrometer with precise value and a strong positive correlation there be again negligible error bar however the error in this gradient be large than the error in the gradient of fig 5 and fig 6. prove the accuracy of this result and that systematic error be unlikely the main error take into account although very small be the human error in take reading from the scale we take this to be half an increment on the vernier scale -0.5 arc minute this be because the room be dark and the scale be very small to read so we have to use a magnify glass this error be propagate throughout equation 3 and 4 and then combine with the standard error of multiple data set to calculate the overall error in r ∞ a show in table 1 the r ∞ value calculate for each different colour photon be always slightly below the theoretical value despite all still be very accurate this may have be cause by a small systematic error there be several possible cause of this systematic error a we have to consider the effect of spectrometer misalignment defocus lamp position grate period air pressure and humidity and background light defocus seem unlikely because the emission line be very sharp and in focus the most likely cause of this systematic error be probably a slight misalignment in the spectrometer this may have explain why all the wavelength value calculate for each spectral line be slightly large than their theoretical value and thus the rydberg constant be always small furthermore θ value should have be the same for positive and negative order of the same magnitude however some be out by 0.5 which highlight how there be a small spectrometer misalignment the spectral resolution of the diffraction grate be limited to the grate period d. to obtain a high spectral resolution grate should be of a very large size or there should be a high number density of slit however this be difficult due to the high-precision process of the spectrometer 7 the grate period calculate from the number of line per mm give on the grate slide may not have be the exact value of the period but in fact slightly large which would explain the slightly large wavelength calculate other factor to consider be air pressure and humidity the theoretical wavelength value give be for those photon travel through a vacuum however the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in air be small to that in a vacuum this be primarily due to the atmosphere have a refractive index that affect the curvature of the electromagnetic path 8 this refractivity of air be dependent on pressure temperature and humidity a they all affect the density of air in a vacuum pressure be far low than the atmospheric pressure experienced in the room there be also matter in the air but not in a vacuum which affect the path of the diffract wave therefore take measurement for pressure temperature and humidity and use formula the density of the room can be calculate in order to calculate the refractive index n of air in the room this can be use to convert the value obtain for wavelength into the wavelength in a vacuum a λ vac nλ air 9 these new value could then be use to calculate r ∞ on the other hand the experiment can be conduct in a vacuum chamber to make the wavelength value more accurate to the theoretical vacuum value background light may have make it harder to view certain order a although external light do n't affect the position of spectral line it affect their relative intensity to the background view through the spectrometer this may have affected how for each colour photon we always found more negative order than positive order a positive and negative order be suppose to be symmetrical about the zeroth order in the same way our lamp position may have obstruct the view of some emission line so some be too faint to be see therefore to improve we could have turn all lamp off before take reading a we may have see more emission line at full intensity and we perhaps could have obtain more data point lead to an even more accurate gradient we may also have see the fourth violet emission line a this be include in the visible range for hydrogen emission line this would increase precision of result and the accuracy of the calculate rydberg constant the aim of the experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ by use a grate spectrometer to calculate the transition wavelength produce in the visible range of the emission line spectrum for hydrogen gas our result for the wavelength r ∞ be very accurate and close to the true value with r ∞ calculate to be 10940685.2 ± 12293.4 m −1 only have a 0.3 error the spectrometer be use effectively to give precise measurement for value of the diffraction angle θ against order m and we be able to obtain value of θ for order of high magnitude up to 12 for aqua emission line the main error account for be the human error in take reading from the vernier scale on the spectrometer however small systematic error be consider in the data analysis a although our result be incredibly accurate they be n't perfect and be all out by a similar amount to improve the experiment perhaps multiple reading could have be take with the experiment repeat and the mean reading record to reduce uncertainty and human error possible systematic error could be take into account such a consider the effect of the atmosphere 's refractive index on the wavelength of the photon and thus conduct the experiment in a vacuum chamber measurement could have be take in order to make estimation for possible systematic error or to determine them which could then be include in the calculation of error also all background light should be eliminate in order to view the spectral line easily a perhaps more could have be observe",deep,exp
79,GS_NPG050_Redacted,"the aim of the experiment be to measure the spectrum of vaporise hydrogen from a hydrogen lamp and determine the wavelength of the spectral line use this we calculate the rydberg constant for each spectral line and found an average and take the standard error the final value of the rydberg constant we obtain be 1.092x10 7 ± 3.180x10 4 m -1 this be a highly precise experiment generate a percentage error of only 0.291 the set up consists of a simple spectrometer with a 78.8 lines/mm diffraction grate and a hydrogen lamp the spectrometer can measure in the vernier scale the small increment of measurement be 1 arcminute we measure the angle at which each order of the spectral line appear after be diffract and plot a sin angle against order graph to determine the wavelength of the spectral line the wavelength be then use with rydberg formula to determine the constant spectrometry be a technique of use em radiation and in specific case also use the mass of an ion and magnetic field to determine the structure or the composition of a material or an object diffract light from a material or the amount of ion deflection in a magnetic field be analyse 1 in our experiment we be focus on the emission spectrum of hydrogen gas a a potential difference v across the filament in the hydrogen lamp be apply the gas be heat and cause the atom to be excite the electron in the atom be promote to a high energy level and then fall to a low energy level energy equivalent to the difference in the energy level be release in the form of a photon 2 the energy level be fix and so only photon with discrete wavelength be release therefore each element or compound have a unique spectral pattern in this experiment we be observe the balmer series in hydrogen this be to say we be look at wavelength of photon generate from an electron transition from a high level n=3,4,5… to energy level p=2 this produce photon in the visible spectrum this can be see in the rydberg formula give by eq 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 𝑛 be the energy level high than 2 and 𝑝 be the 2 nd energy level 3 the light in the spectrometer can diffract through a diffraction grate the wavelength of each spectral line can be determine by the diffraction formula give by eq 2 where ⅆ be the distance between the slit in the diffraction grate 𝜃 be the angle at which the order appear in radian 𝑚 be the order at which the spectral line appear where m 0 ±1 ±2 etc and 𝜆 be the wavelength pf the spectral line 4 the central order m =0 will appear at 𝜃 =0 at the central order all the spectral line will be overlap the set up consists of a simple spectrometer with a 78.8 lines/mm diffraction grate and a sodium or hydrogen lamp the set up can be see in fig 1. sodium lamp be use to ready the spectrometer a it produce high intensity light and have a longer operational time than the hydrogen lamp however the sodium lamp do take some time about 2 minute to reach maximum intensity it have a manageable warm up time this overall make the set up of the spectrometer much easy a time can be take to make fine adjustment the disadvantage of use a hydrogen lamp instead of shin light through a vial of vaporise hydrogen and measure an absorption spectrum be that lamp only remains bright enough to make measurement of the low wavelength light for about 10 minute it also only have an operational time of 20 minute this meant that the measurement have to make quickly this however be still more manageable than the alternate method of produce the hydrogen spectrum a the light emit through the hydrogen may have it own spectrum this may lead to confusion when analyse the overall spectrum the sodium lamp be set up in front of the slit and the slit be narrow the intensity of light from the sodium lamp be high and the narrow slit provide a high resolution of the spectral line the resolution be the ability to separate two spectral line and see them discretely the spectral line be then focus use the focus nob the spectral line be ensure to be vertical by place a filter that block some light and turn the line into small dot it be important to ensure that the spectral line be vertical so that the angle measure be in a plane that be perpendicular to the line the filter be make by cut a triangle in a black square card it be position in front of the slit and adjust until the line appear to be dot the filter be then taped on to the slit securely hold it in position the head of the spectrometer be rotate from left to right and we observe if the crosshair pas through the centre of the dot if the crosshair do n't then the stand hold the diffraction grate be adjust use the 3 level screw until it do the filter be then remove a diagram of the filter can be see in fig 2 the diffraction grate be also place such that it be perpendicular to the slit and lens array in front of the lamp preliminary data of the order and angle at which the order appear be make use the sodium lamp here we notice that it be best to make measurement by rotate the head in one direction ie go from m= -4 to m=4 rather than start at the m=0 and change direction after reach the high order this be because change direction occasionally cause the spectrometer to shift a it be not fix to the table finally we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be place such that it be closer to the slit and the centre of the lamp face the slit the centre of the lamp be the brightest part of it the slit be also make to be a bit wider than before this allow more light into the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp be dimmer than the sodium lamp this however decrease the resolution of the spectral line the spectrometer be refocus and measurement be make first we slowly move from the 0 th order a this be the easy to identify to the -4 th order which we define to be in the clockwise direction then we measure the angle at which the red spectral line appear make sure to keep the crosshair in the centre of the line this be do by use the fine adjustment screw locate on the base we then measure the angle of the subsequent order of the red line until we reach m +4 we then repeat the same technique with the blue and purple line the observe spectral pattern of hydrogen can be see in fig 3 and the data of the angle of each order for each spectral line can be see in appendix a. a see in fig 3 the pattern also contains a rainbow artefact this be due to light from the surround enter the spectrometer if the experiment be do in perfectly dark condition then this pattern would not be see",superficial,bal

be not within the calculate error range for the experiment which be believe to be due to other source of error not account for the rydberg constant be a fundamental constant of physic and be formulate by physicist johannes rydberg in 1890 a part of the rydberg formula the rydberg formula be use to find the wavelength of a photon travel between energy level in an atom this be very significant a it allows for the calculation of the wavelength of an emit photon without know the value for the energy difference between these energy level in the atom in this experiment a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp be use in order to measure the diffraction angle of emission line which be in turn use to find the wavelength of emit photon which could be use with the rydberg formula to calculate a value of the rydberg constant photon will be emit from a gas when it be hot a electron that have become excite to high energy level be prone to spontaneous emission in which the electron fall from a high energy level to a low energy level and emits a photon with energy equal to the difference in energy level when the difference in energy level be not know the rydberg formula can be employ to find the wavelength and in turn energy of the photon for a hydrogen atom this formula be where 𝜆 be the wavelength 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant and n and p be initial and final state respectively of the electron this mean that be the final and initial state of the electron be know a value for the wavelength of an emit photon can be found each value of p have it own emission series and in this experiment a value of p=2 be use a it be the balmer series in hydrogen in which the transition wavelength be in the visible part of the spectrum and so can be observe by eye a diffraction grate

for principal maximum of light through a diffraction grate where n be an integer now use we obtain measurement of the rydberg constant use the grate spectrometer where d be the slit separation which can be use to calculate the wavelength of the emit photon if the wavelength initial and final state be know then equation 1 can be use to calculate the rydberg constant the grate spectrometer that be use for the data collection first require to be calibrate precisely this be do by first focus the eyepiece on the crosshair and then to focus the camera lens on an object approximately 5-10 metre away next the crosshair be to be align with the image of the slit and the focus of the collimator adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the crosshair the angle which the telescope be currently at be the initial angle and all record will be from this the telescope be then rotate 90 degree clamped into position and a grate be put in the holder next the grate table be move until a reflect image of the entrance slit could be slit which meant that the grate surface be at a 45 degree angle to the light from the collimator and the grate drive be use to adjust the slit image until it be at the crosshair the grate table and telescope be then move back 45 and 90 degree respectively to their original position so that the grate be now perpendicular to the light and the telescope be parallel to the collimator axis data be collect for 3 different wavelength correspond to the colour red blue and violet with initial state n=3,4,5 respectively the angle of each successive maximum on either

true value and there be a 3.64 difference between 𝑅 ∞avg and the accepted value it be likely that the reason for this be due to unaccounted error such a one described above and also the failure to set up the grate spectrometer adequately which would have lead to a systematic error in the record in addition to this despite the vernier scale be very precise it be often the case that there be a

82,GS_UGX035_Redacted,troscopy method with a hydrogen lamp the aim be to determine a value for the rydberg constant while investigate the effectiveness of the grate spectrometer in study the spectrum

656.1 ± 2.7 nm 490.8 ± 3.4 nm and 439.8 ± 6.0 nm be calculate for red aqua and blue photon respectively these intermediate result far show the effective use of the spectrometer in achieve precision the result be only a little inaccurate because within experimental uncertainty it do n't quite agree with the accepted value of 10 973 736.6 m 1 for the rydberg constant this be due to a small systematic error t he grate spectrometer be a device that be construct with a specific pathway for light spectroscopy involves the study of spectrum by take measurement of radiation and this device be just one of many that can be use for this purpose electromagnetic radiation be able to pa through the spectrometer via a slit and then a collimator grate and camera before enter an eyepiece for observation the grate spectrometer be a great tool and can be use to show relationship between many quantity through the calculation of specific wavelength and constant like that of the rydberg constant this ability to identify relationship mean it have great importance with it application for example the result it be capable of produce allow the determination of gas temperature and density on a small scale and the velocity of galaxy with respect to each other on a large scale 1 exploit these experimental property meant that the rydberg constant could be found by take measurement of the emission spectrum produce by a hydrogen lamp specifically it be the analysis of interference pattern produce by the grate for different wavelength that contribute to the calculation diffraction be a process that result in the spread of wave a they pa an aperture or edge electromagnetic radiation can be consider to occur in waveform so it be able to undergo this phenomenon in the case of the grate spectrometer there be a diffraction grate which act a multiple aperture a the light wave pas through the aperture diffraction will occur and this will be more observable when the width of the aperture be similar to that of the light wavelength the grate consists of many narrow slit which have the same width and be separate equally each slit cause diffraction to occur and therefore interference can also happen this be because the light wave from each slit will cross path and superimpose path difference be the respective difference in distance travel by wave after exit the slit it be illustrate in fig 1 and through the use of trigonometry the path difference be give by where be the path difference d be the slit separation and ✓ be the diffraction angle the superposition result in an interference pattern form because the wave be able to interfere with each other periodically such that a consistent pattern be produce the interference occurs constructively when the wave meet in phase meaning there be a phase difference between them of a multiple of 2⇡ where be the phase difference and m be the order number the wavenumber which be write a k be characteristic to a wave and be consider a the phase per unit distance a demonstrate by this equation where be the wavelength the fractional distance of the wavelength move in other word the phase difference relates to the path difference by the follow equation equate the result in equation 1 equation 2 and equation 4gives the follow relationship between the separation of slit and the wavelength b. energy level in quantum theory atom consist of neutron and proton in their central nucleus with electron in surround orbital shell quantum theory explains the characteristic behaviour of the electron because of the quantum mechanical system they can be consider to act in the atom be clearly stable because it can retain it initial state in most case provide that it be not radioactive the explanation for the model of the atom by classical mechanic be unstable because it allows the electron to have any energy whereas in quantum mechanic the electron can only have specific discrete value of energy the electron be a negatively charge particle and will experience an attractive force due to it interaction with the positively charge nucleus a coulomb 's law state the presence of a resultant force by newton 's second law mean it be also accelerate accord to the larmor formula 3 the electron will radiate power because it be both charge and accelerate this radiation represent an energy loss and in the classical model this electron would spiral into the nucleus a represent in fig 2 meaning that the whole atom itself appear to be unstable fig 2. the classical model to the left show an electron that loses energy collapse towards the nucleus this electron be particle like the quantum model to the right show a stable electron orbit the nucleus with fix energy this electron be wave like 4 the quantum model allows electron to have discrete quantity of energy a way in which this be possible be if the electron be to act a stand wave in each orbit the orbit have a circumference that be a multiple of the electron 's wavelength which mean the orbit can only occur at specific distance from the nucleus the electron can only exist in these discrete orbit therefore they can only transition between these particular position 5 these transition amount to a change in total energy because there be a change in both potential energy and kinetic energy there be two case one where an electron drop an energy level and another where it rise an energy level rise an energy level require a gain in energy this be ultimately because the potential energy be increase and the attraction to the nucleus must be overcome fig 3. the electron move from a discrete high energy level to a discrete low energy level therefore there be a discrete energy loss which occurs a electromagnetic radiation this electromagnetic radiation be present a a photon characterise by a specific wavelength and frequency drop an energy level amount to a decrease in energy and it be this case that be explore in this experiment the decrease in energy be represent by the emission of a photon a fig 3 illustrates the photon emit will have a discrete amount of energy because of the discrete orbitals these packet of energy be quantise by the follow equation where e be the energy of the photon h be planck 's constant and ⌫ be the frequency of the photon this can be rewrite a where c be the speed of light consider this energy be quantise there must be a some kind of relationship between the energy of emit photon and their orbital ring or in other word energy level this energy be a function of wavelength a equation 7 show and so this relationship can be express by the equation where be specifically the wavelength of the emit photon in a vacuum r 1 be the rydberg constant z be the atomic number n be the initial energy level of the electron and p be the final energy level of the electron in the case of hydrogen because it only have one the equation simplifies to the transition between the energy level have many combination so they be divide in to series which be characterise by the final energy level of the electron the balmer series be one that be define for when electron drop down to the second energy level other series such a the lyman and paschen be define by energy level of 1 and 3 respectively 6 the significance of the balmer series be that it be the only series that produce wavelength within the visible light spectrum therefore throughout the analysis of the hydrogen emission spectrum the only line that can be view directly by eye in the laboratory be from the balmer series the transition which give visible light only go up to the point where the electron begin at energy level 6. this be because the change in energy level becomes so large that the wavelength of the emit photon be too small to be observe the human eye can view electromagnetic wave with wavelength between 400 and 700 nm the wavelength emit on the visible spectrum correspond to different colour emission a picture in fig 4. the grate spectrometer be set up on a raise platform by be attach to a small table so that all observation could easily be take at eye level throughout the experiment it be make sure that the optical equipment be not touch so that the equipment be clean and light could travel a expect the camera lens of the telescope be focus onto an object that be around 5 to 10 meter away this be do in a well lit room to make the image easy for view the eyepiece lens be then focus onto the crosshair to reduce parallax between the image and the crosshair itself once this be do the experiment be move into a darken room the telescope be align directly with the axis of the collimator so that they be position in a straight line a sodium lamp be place behind the slit for the rest of the setup in order to protect the hydrogen lamp a prolong use of it could have cause it to overheat and become damage the light from the slit be view through the eyepiece and the focus of the collimator be adjust until slit light be focus on the crosshair the slit size be reduce to the point where it be more manageable to focus it the crosshair be also rotate to a cross position a oppose to a plus position to aid this focus process the main scale and vernier scale be use to record the exact position of the telescope the grate table be rotate through 90 degree with the slow motion drive aid this rotation to be a accurate a possible once it be clamped tightly into position a mirror be place in the holder fig 5. the light from the hydrogen lamp pas through the slit and a reduce segment of it be capture this fraction of light can be diffract by the slit but the ray of light be make parallel when they pa through the collimator these parallel beam be then diffract by the diffraction grate have met it surface perpendicularly these diffract light ray then enter the telescope and be magnify into the eyepiece by passing through the camera lens and eyepiece lens 8 the holder be rotate until a reflect image from the collimator be view from the eyepiece to ensure that the grate surface be at 45 degree to the incident ray the adjustment screw on the grate table be alter so that the table be horizontal and at a height where the image be align with the crosshair the angle of the grate table be record and rotate through by 45 degree use the table and slow motion drive so that it surface be perpendicular to the incident ray the mirror be replace for a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm the telescope be finally then move back through 90 o to it original position so it be in alignment with the slit collimator and grate at this original position the light be observe a be a maximum with a combination of colour that have not be diffract at all this be take to be the reference point for order 0 and it position be record a 183.5 o 5 ± 0.5 the spectral line be observe briefly by rotate the telescope the slit size be alter by decrease and increase it until the line could be view optimally start from the maximum order at 183.5 o 5 the positive direction be take to be clockwise in which the scale of the angle reading increase the order record from here be also take to be positive the telescope be slowly rotate around until the first order be locate the colour present be record position the crosshair on each spectral line meant the angle on the scale could be measure for each colour at order 1. this be repeat across the whole quadrant for the subsequent order until no more line could be observe at all the telescope be then take in the counterclockwise direction from the reference point and the same reading be record such that the angle on the scale be decrease and the order be consider to be negative three colour be observe throughout the experiment these be red aqua and blue which can also be name h-↵ h-and h-respectively in relation to their electron 's initial position for all of these wavelength there be a positive correlation present between the sine of the diffraction angle and the order associate with that angle the diffraction angle be calculate by subtract the reference angle of 183.5 o 5 from the record value on the scale each reading have an error of 0.5 arcminute so the error in the diffraction angle be simply calculate by add the error in quadrature for the subtraction this meant each diffraction angle have an error of 0.71 arcminute with respect to the sine of the angle this error can be consider negligible a show by the very small error in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8. this emphasis the precision the grate spectrometer can have when take measurement the graph be manipulate such that they pas through the origin because this be a specific value for the datasets and can be record a well a state without error because it occurs at the reference angle for this experiment the wavelength and their error be calculate by multiply the gradient and error by the grate period of 12.69 µm the grate period be take to have no error because it be custom make therefore the only error account for in this calculation result from the angle measurement the red wavelength be calculate a 656.1 ± 2.7 nm this be closely align with the accepted value of 656.3nm within experimental uncertainty the aqua wavelength be calculate a 490.8 ± 3.4 nm 486.1 nm be the accepted value and the calculate value do n't agree with this experimentally but this be only a slight difference the blue wavelength be calculate a 439.8 ± 6.0 nm this wavelength coincides with the accepted one of 434.0 nm within the experimental error obtain the position of the lamp be found to have no affect on the position of the line because the slit still accepts a fraction of the light it be found however that the lamp position affected the intensity of the light with a reduction if it be far away therefore if it be n't a close a possible to the slit the line at great order may not have be visible a likely cause for an error in the wavelength be the calibration of the spectrometer the fact that the anticlockwise direction have more observable order suggests the diffraction pattern be n't symmetric about our reference point this mean the calibration of the instrument ca n't have be correct and the light may have hit the grate surface at an angle that be n't the normal this be highlight by the modulus value of the diffraction angle for each order in table i the symmetry appear to get bad a the wavelength decrease fig 6. a linear relationship be show between the sine of the diffraction angle and the order this red photon give the steepest gradient out of the three photon with a value of 0.05170 ± 0.00021 and this corresponds to how the absolute value of the error for the wavelength also increase a wavelength decrease to improve in this case a great grate period could be use a although less order would be present the same number should still be record-able the pattern would also be more symmetric because the angle of each order would be much more similar a far extension of this would have be to check the symmetry before take measurement by verify if it be calibrate correctly the air pressure humidity and temperature affect the record of the wavelength in a systematic way because when the each of these value increase the air in the room becomes less vacuum like the increase in pressure mean the pressure be n't exactly that of a vacuum increase in the number of water molecule in the air mean that the area be n't a deplete of matter so the air be less of a vacuum furthermore by the gay-lussac law the great temperature result in the pressure be great too such that it be less vacuum like 9 all of this mean the refractive index be great than that of a perfect vacuum so the speed of the light be less result in a reduce wavelength in this case the wavelength be n't less but actually slightly great therefore this must n't be a significant contributor to the variation of wavelength to their accepted value a likely systematic error would be that of the grate period it may not be exactly a state but actual more therefore the wavelength be calculate a be great than they should be in addition to this the separation may not be perfectly uniform and so wavelength would of course appear to be slightly different this would require a test of the diffraction grate value use a know wavelength for a monochromatic light by the same method a this experiment the calculate wavelength for each photon emission be related to their respective emission level use the balmer series it be evident that the red photon occur by an electron drop from a low energy level than the others equation 7 show this a it 's clear a large wavelength cause a small energy change therefore it could be conclude that the respective energy level state be 3 for h-↵ 4 for h-fig 8. this linear relationship have the shallowest gradient of the three photon of 0.03466 ± 0.00047 because it have the great energy and therefore the small wavelength and 5 for h- the reciprocal of the wavelength be plot against the change in the reciprocal of the square of the energy level to give a straight line in fig 9. the covariance matrix for this plot could not be calculate because there be only three point however the line clearly illustrates the linear relationship present where the gradient be the negative of the rydberg constant a predict by equation 8. the rydberg constant be calculate by consider each of the three value of the constant from the three wavelength a independent value that can form a normal distribution with a mean and standard error use equation 9. the rydberg value be found to have an average of 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 this meant the rydberg constant calculate can be state a 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 the value deduce for the rydberg constant do not agree with the accepted value of 10 973 731.6 m 1 this be only ever so slightly a the percentage difference be 0.77 this would suggest that the experiment be very accurate a it only differs from the accepted value slightly however within experimental uncertainty it be do n't therefore there be likely to be a small systematic error this error would have occur in the measurement take for the wavelength if the fourth colour be observe the experiment would have be well a the precision would be great because fig 9. there be a linear trend between the change in the reciprocal of the energy level square the slope be define a the negative of the rydberg constant the dash line be that of the actual constant and the solid one be the experimental one so it be evident there be a systematic error because the experimental value be shallower and therefore less than the accepted value the error be less and the linear relationship would have be verify more strongly the fact that there be only four point that be visible be still very little therefore a way in which the experiment can be improve to allow for more data point in the final plot be to record wavelength that be n't visible a method for this would be to use a uv-meter this would allow not only the uv-light in the balmer series to be detect but the uv-light in the lyman series the rydberg constant be deduce a 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 this be a very precise result with a small percentage error of 0.40 it only deviate from the accepted value by 0.77 and this be most likely due to a small systematic error it be show that the grate spectrometer be effective in study the spectrum of light the proportional relationship between the sine of diffraction angle and their order be consistently verify this allow precise and accurate wavelength of h-↵ h-and h-to be calculate a 656.1 ± 2.7 nm 490.8 ± 3.4 nm and 439.8 ± 6.0 nm respectively a clear success for this experiment be the use of the spectrometer because record be take efficiently and precisely with the main and vernier scale despite this successful usage the setup could definitely be improve with well calibration to ensure that the pattern be symmetric about order 0. furthermore extra investigation could be carry out to estimate the magnitude of the potential systematic error an adaptation to the experiment would involve increase the number of wavelength obtain so that the experiment have less spread the use of a uv-meter would enable more line to be record the repetition of the experiment in a glass chamber would ensure the area be a close to a vacuum a possible allow great accuracy for the wavelength value the grate spectrometer be a sufficient device for deduce the rydberg constant and it be effective in produce precise result the combination of many theory like quantum and wave-particle duality result in the rydberg constant meaning it be a vital constant in explain the model of the atom,deep,bal
83,GS_KUY555_Redacted,in this experiment we attempt to determine the rydberg constant by direct measurement of the wavelength of photon emit from the de-excitation of hydrogen atom in the balmer series use a spectrometer with diffraction grate of line density n 300mm −1 grate 1 and n 78.8mm −1 grate 2 we then use the rydberg equation to make an estimate of the rydberg constant from the gradient and y-intercept of the plot we estimate the rydberg constant within a tolerance of 2.7 or less use grate 1 we calculate r∞ 1.11 ± 0.03 × 10 7 m −1 and r∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and y-intercept respectively for grate 2 we have r∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 and r∞ 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and yintercept respectively s pectrometer device be use to observe the emission or absorption spectrum of a light source or gaseous atom spectrometer typically offer measurement to an accuracy of ±1 or 1 arc-minute 1 when propagate through this be equivalent to an error in the wavelength of approximately σ λ 0.03 give sufficient repeat measurement be make 2 make it one of the most accurate experimental equipment available a spectrometer be usually configure along with a refractive prism or a diffraction grate by use the prism it be possible to analyse the amount of refraction undergone by each incident wavelength of light and therefore determine the refractive index of the prism a a function of wavelength 3 by use a diffraction grate it be possible to use the diffraction angle to determine the wavelength of the incident light in our experiment we will be use the latter technique to analyse the emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp the grate spectrometer have a range of application for example the grate spectrometer be use by fraunhofer in 1814 to see the 574 dark line of the solar absorption spectrum 4 which be subsequently use to determine the atomic composition of the sun similarly the light from distant star have be analyse by highly sensitive grate spectrometer and this have be use to determine their atomic composition which subsequently allows astrophysicist to infer the temperature and age of these star spectrometry can also be use with gas chromatography in forensics to analyse the composition of a sample of material a discus by knight the ratio of the intensity of these spectral line be related to the temperature of the gaseous sample while the width of the line be related to the density of the gas 2 give vital clue for analysis of the sample this technique can be use to confirm the presence of certain atom for example in a drug sample or can be use to verify the purity of water 5 the rydberg constant be fundamental to physic and be related to a number of physical quantity primarily the rydberg constant be the constant of proportionality in the rydberg equation which relates the wavelength of light emit by excite electron when they transition between the energy level of a hydrogen atom the value of the rydberg constant denote r ∞ be approximately 6 r ∞ 1.09737 × 10 7 m −1 however the rydberg constant also have other application for example it can be define in term of the fine structure constant α 7.29735 × 10 −3 which be a dimensionless quantity that characterises the ratio of the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two electron to the strength of the gravitational interaction between two planck mass 7 then the rydberg constant can be express a where a 0 5.29177 × 10 −11 m be the bohr radius the wavelength of light need to ionise a hydrogen atom be λ 9.12 × 10 −8 m and can be calculate by equate eq 1 to 1/λ from the planck-einstein relation the ionisation energy of the hydrogen atom be then e 2.176 × 10 −18 j. the rydberg constant be also related to the compton wavelength of an electron λ e by therefore the compton wavelength of an electron be λ e 2.426 × 10 −12 m. note that the relationship of the rydberg constant to other physical constant provide an indirect method of determine these constant for example if we be able to determine the rydberg constant through a grate spectrometer experiment then we be subsequently able to determine other related quantity such a the fine structure constant the bohr radius or the compton wavelength of an electron which can then be use to determine planck 's constant or the mass of an electron the ability to measure the rydberg constant accurately also limit the error in these related quantity that may be more difficult to measure experimentally spectrometry be the process of analyse the emission spectrum of a light source or the absorption spectrum of a sample material to understand the principle of spectroscopy the bohr model of the atom be use where electron exist only in discrete energy level which be unique to each atom therefore the energy level transition -that be the energy need for an electron to transition from a low energy state to high energy state -are generally unique for each atom when an atom de-excites it electron transition from a high energy state to a low energy state release energy a photon the energy release from each de-excitation event be equal to the energy difference between the initial energy state and the final energy state a these energy difference be discrete and unique for each atom the energy of the photon emit and hence the wavelength of the photon emit be also discrete and unique for each atom when an atom be excite by heating it electron move to high energy level but be unstable in these energy level and will spontaneously de-excite emit photon of discrete wavelength if these emit photon be analyse they will produce an emission spectrum conversely if an atom in it ground state be expose to white light contain photon with energy that coincide with the transition energy of the atom the ground state electron will absorb these photon and transition to the high energy level this will produce absorption spectrum of dark line where certain wavelength of white light be absorbed by the electron of gaseous atom in this experiment we will consider the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom hydrogen have a number of spectral series for example the lyman series be the set of spectral line when excite electron from energy level n 2 3 4 de-excite to the ground state we will focus on the balmer series which refers to the spectral line emission when electron in energy level n 3 4 5 de-excite to the second energy level this be because the balmer series be the only spectral series for hydrogen that result in the emission of line in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum the define equation for this behaviour be the rydberg equation where λ be the wavelength of the photon emit when an electron de-excites from the nth energy level to the pth energy level p n a before r ∞ be the rydberg constant p 2 for the balmer series and n 3 4 5 then the value of λ for different value of n be give in table i. the diffraction grate of the grate spectrometer behaves accord to the principle of diffraction and interference diffraction occurs when a wavefront encounter an obstruction the balmer series -these be the wavelength of photon emit when an electron in a hydrogen atom deexcites from the nth energy level to the second energy level note that n could take any value up to ∞ but these value of n be the only one that produce photon in the visible spectrum which range from 400-700nm 8 in it path such a an aperture or an obstacle 1 this cause the wavefront to curve around the obstruction which creates a path difference between different ray and therefore cause interference produce an intensity pattern that depends on the geometry of the setup when the number of slit be increase the intensity pattern becomes more complicate and be show for n 2 10 slit in fig 1. fig 1 plot show the intensity pattern produce by diffraction through n slit for a fix slit width and slit separation solid line note that each of the intensity pattern be modulate by the intensity pattern of single slit diffraction dash line since each slit have a finite width and therefore light also undergoes single slit diffraction through these slit the equation for the intensity pattern produce by a wave of wavelength λ diffract through a diffraction grate of line density n be 9 in this experiment we aim to use a grate spectrometer to make an estimate of the rydberg constant firstly we will use the grate spectrometer to measure the diffraction angle and hence the wavelength of light emit by a light source contain gaseous hydrogen atom we will compare these wavelength to those suggest by the rydberg equation accord to the balmer series allow u to make an estimate of the rydberg constant we can now use our derive equation to make prediction about the experiment firstly from the rydberg equation eq 2 we predict that we will observe principle maximum correspond to the wavelength and colour specify in table i. it be possible that the maximum correspond to λ 410nm will not be visible a it be almost outside of the visible light spectrum nevertheless we should be able to make measurement of at least three of the wavelength in table i. we can make the measurement of the wavelength λ by record the order m of the maximum observe and the diffraction angle θ at which the maximum occurs use the spectrometer then with sufficient repeat measurement we plot the graph of sin θ against m correspond to the relation give in eq 4. hence the slope of this plot should be and therefore we can determine the wavelength λ. once we have record the wavelength for correspond value of n from table i we then use the relationship in eq 2 to plot a graph of 1/λ against 1/n 2 this plot should have slope give by s −r ∞ 6 and y-intercept since p 2 for the balmer series we can determine the rydberg constant from these relationship we use a grate spectrometer with an engrave vernier scale on a rotate diffraction table the spectrometer include a collimator with a slit which ensures that the incident ray be parallel and an eyepiece which allows the intensity pattern to be observe a the light source we use a hydrogen lamp which excites gaseous hydrogen atom by passing a current through the gas the emit light be a mixture of wavelength but we will only be able to observe the visible photon with wavelength a specify in table i. we also have diffraction grate of slit density n 78.8mm −1 and n 300mm −1 provide to u fig 2 show the set-up of the apparatus a view from above fig 2 a plan view of the apparatus use to measure the wavelength of light emit by de-excitation of hydrogen atom the light emit by a hydrogen lamp be collimate before be diffract through the diffraction grate the rotate eyepiece can then be use to record the order m and the angle θ m of the spectral line first we configure the eyepiece by adjust the focus until it produce a clear pattern of the crosshairs we also rotate the crosshairs until they form an × instead of a this make it easy to find the centre of the spectral line see fig 7 in appendix b to complete the experiment successfully it be crucial that the light from the hydrogen lamp be perpendicular to the diffraction grate to prevent oblique incidence pattern which complicates the analysis 10 to do this we first lock the diffraction table and align the eyepiece parallel to the collimator while ensure no diffraction grate be use a source of light e.g desk lamp be use to illuminate the slit cover the opening of the collimator the slit be then close until the central line be view a a clear vertical line from the eyepiece if the line be not vertical the angle of the slit be adjust until this requirement be met once the crosshairs be centre on the line of light from the desk lamp the eyepiece be fix in position and an initial reading of the angle be take from the vernier scale on the diffraction table from this reading we subtract 90 • and then rotate the eyepiece to the calculate angle this ensures that the eyepiece be exactly perpendicular to the collimator from this angle we lock the eyepiece and unlock the diffraction table we place a reflective mirror in the slit holder and rotate the diffraction table until the reflect light from the desk lamp be incident on the centre of the crosshairs in the eyepiece this ensures that the grate holder be now position at an angle of 45 • to the collimator we take a note of this reading and add 45 • before rotate the diffraction table until it be at the require angle now the diffraction holder be align perpendicular to the ray from the collimator for the remainder of the experiment the diffraction table will remain lock in this position this alignment procedure be show in fig 3. fig 3 calibrate the spectrometer -it be essential that the spectrometer be align such that the incidence ray be perpendicular to the diffraction grate in order to prevent the effect of oblique incidence 10 initially we use grate 1 a this will produce a wider intensity pattern and will therefore have a small percentage error in the diffraction angle measurement we turn off external source of light and position a hydrogen lamp close to the slit of the collimator then we place the diffraction grate into the grate holder and rotate the eyepiece until the crosshairs be centre on the central fringe for each colour of spectral line visible we record the angle of the spectral line for each order up to the maximum visible order afterwards we repeat the experiment use the 2nd grate to give u additional measurement of the wavelength in the balmer series a expect the fourth spectral line correspond to the wavelength λ 410nm be too dark to measure accurately therefore the final data consist of only three visible spectral line the complete dataset be include in appendix c for your inspection to be able to plot the data we have collect we first convert each angle from arc-minutes to it radian equivalent use the formula where α be the degree element of the angle and d be the arcminute element subsequently we normalise the angle of each colour by subtract the average of the m 0 order maximum from each of the measure angle thereby ensure that the central fringe occurs at θ 0rad plot each of the value of sin θ for normalise θ against order of maximum m produce a linear graph for each of the visible wavelength of the balmer series a show in fig 4. from the plot in fig 4 we can deduce the wavelength of each of the spectral line use eq 4. these result be summarise in table ii now for each of the value of n and calculate λ we plot 1/λ against 1/n 2 accord to the relationship specify in eq 2. these plot be show in fig 5. from these graph we calculate the rydberg constant a summarise in table iii the error calculation in table ii and table iii have be adjust to account for the uncertainty due to the resolution of an instrument a well a the systematic error discus below for example the vernier scale offer an accuracy of up to ±1 or ±0.0167 • but the actual uncertainty in each measurement of the angle be great this be primarily because fig 4 a plot of sin θ against m for both diffraction grate note that the red light have the steepest gradient a it have the long wavelength which confirms the relationship in eq 5. with the 1st grate the maximum be spread far apart but their intensity reduces with θ so only the first three order of maximum be visible for the 2nd grate the percentage error in each measurement of the angle be great than with the denser grate but more maximum be visible with this grate and therefore the overall error in the wavelength be low of a significant parallax error when reading the vernier scale which give error up to ±3 depend on the angle the scale be be read from to minimise this we try to read the scale from directly above additionally the dark condition in the room meant that it be difficult for our eye to determine the exact point at which the engrave of the vernier scale line up sometimes lead to disagreement in the reading of up to ±6 furthermore there would be an error associate with the measurement of the angle of the central fringe which be propagate through each reading when the angle be normalise this central fringe angle be calculate from an average of three reading and therefore be likely to have a small error of around ±0.5 another source of error related to the alignment of the grate be in relation to the use of a mirror the mirror reflect light upon incidence with it surface but a diffraction grate diffracts light after it pas through the surface if we assume that the thickness of the mirror be approximately 2mm this would cause a shift in the reflection by up to fig 5 a plot of the inverse wavelength 1/λ against 1/n 2 where n be the quantum number of the energy level in the balmer series a specify in table i for the n 300mm −1 grate φ 64 see fig 6 which would impact the alignment throughout the experiment this error could be minimise by use a thinner mirror use a spectrometer which have a large distance between the diffraction grate and the eyepiece or hold the mirror on the outer side of the grate holder so that the thickness of the mirror can be neglect the systematic error due to the thickness of the mirror can not be measure by experiment since all of the measure value be affected by this systematic error and be therefore consistent however note that the misalignment of the diffraction grate cause all of the spectral line to shift by φ but this should not impact the relative angle between order and therefore should not be account for in the error calculation above accounting for these factor the uncertainty in our measurement of the angle be more than the resolution of the vernier scale it be reasonable to assume that this error be likely to be approximately ±6 which be what have be use for the measurement in table ii a minor source of error be in the value of the line density of each grate we be told that the line density be n 300mm −1 and n 80mm −1 nominally and these be often accurately produce with error approximately σ n ±0.001mm −1 however the diffraction grate be use and have scratch surface which would diminish their ability to diffract light therefore a conservative estimate of fig 6 a possibility of an error arise in the alignment of the spectrometer due to a finite thickness of the mirror the error in these diffraction grate be 0.1 these error have also be account for in the error calculation in table ii lastly we consider the error contribution due to external source or change condition for example heating of the hydrogen lamp may cause it to emit additional wavelength of light if the tube be not adequately evacuate in our experiment we observe an unexpected yellow spectral line while take measurement while we could not determine the source of the yellow spectral line we decide to ignore it a erroneous and focus primarily on those colour we have predict in our theory but this introduces the possibility that there be other erroneous spectral line in our data to prevent change temperature condition from affect our result we take the precaution of measure the result alternately -that be first red line then violet line then blue line -to ensure there be no immediate pattern in term of the wavelength of the light that could have be impact by the change external condition the final table of error contribution in the value of the rydberg constant be show in table iv the error in the rydberg constant be mostly due to the error in the diffraction angle of σ θ ±6 which subsequently impact upon the error in the wavelength of light from the balmer series however this error be reduce by take repeat reading in use the spectrometer we be able to accurately determine the angle of diffraction for different wavelength by measure the angle at which their spectral line form on an emission spectrum the spectrometer offer an accuracy of ±1 but we be unable to take advantage of this accuracy due to systematic inaccuracy e.g parallax error however we be able to collect a significant amount of data in order to reduce the effect of random error for each wavelength and each order we take up to three measurement and be able to take the average of these to a good degree of accuracy this be a strength of the experiment -the ability to reproduce the same result with consistency and very small fluctuation due to random error a limitation of this experiment be that it rely on the balmer series because it be the only series that produce visible light for the hydrogen atom in the balmer series we be only able to observe 3 of the possible 4 visible wavelength of light which meant that while our error in the wavelength could be reduce by do repeat measurement the error in the rydberg constant be great owe to the fact that we only have three data point for the rydberg plot this be the reason for repeat the experiment with the n 78.8mm −1 grate to provide additional data point for the rydberg plot however a more effective technique would have enable u to measure the wavelength of light from the ultraviolet spectrum e.g by use a uv image camera provide additional data point to more accurately determine the rydberg constant a weakness of this method of determine the rydberg constant be that it assumes the bohr model perfectly describes energy level transition for atom however the bohr model be not completely accurate a it do not account for the effect of fine structure 11 -which concern relativity on an atomic level and electron spin -and hyperfine splitting 12 which take into consideration the existence of electron cloud rather than energy level a a result of these effect the rydberg constant be often not measure directly from observation of the spectral line instead emission spectrum of hydrogen and deuterium be use before make adjustment for the fine structure hyperfine splitting and a finite nuclear mass a more accurate method would account for these effect in summary we use the balmer series of hydrogen to calculate the wavelength of photon emit when electron transition from energy level n 3 4 5 to p 2 use a spectrometer and grate of line density n 300mm −1 and n 78.8mm −1 with eq 4. we then plot our calculate wavelength accord to the relationship in eq 2 and calculate the rydberg constant from both the gradient and the y-intercept quantity use eq 6 and eq 7. use the n 300mm −1 grate we calculate r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.03 × 10 7 m −1 and r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and y-intercept respectively for the n 78.8mm −1 grate we have r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 and r ∞ 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and y-intercept respectively the intensity pattern of the single slit envelope be govern by the expression sin 2 α α 2 while the principle maximum of the multiple slit intensity pattern be give by the equation accord to weisstein 13 the latter expression can be rewrite a appendix c final data this be the final dataset for this experiment spectral line that could not be see or distinguish be omit,prediction,exp
84,GS_VEJ488_Redacted,an experiment have be carry out to measure the rydberg constant by use of a spectrometer with a diffraction grate the rydberg constant r∞ which relates the wavelength of photon in the balmer series emit by hydrogen to energy level transition in hydrogen have be measure to be r∞ 1.10 × 10 7 ± 1 × 10 5 m −1 which be in agreement with the accepted value 1 this be do by measure the diffraction angle of light of the emission line spectrum of a hydrogen lamp through a diffraction grate and from this deduce the correspond wavelength of the emit light these wavelength be use with the rydberg formula for hydrogen to determine a value of the rydberg constant when a hydrogen atom transition from one energy level to a low energy level a photon be emit with energy correspond to the difference of those two energy level since there be discrete energy level the photon energy can only take discrete value by extension the photon wavelength can also only take certain discrete value a the wavelength of light be inversely proportional to it energy the relation between wavelength and energy level be discus in section 2 and the relation include a constant of proportionality r ∞ the rydberg constant this relation be of importance a hydrogen be abundant in the universe the emission spectrum of which provide insight in many area such a astronomy this experiment determines the rydberg constant by measure the wavelength of some of the spectral emission line of different energy level transition this be do by use of a spectrometer which pas the light from a hydrogen lamp through a diffraction grate separate the light of different wavelength across multiple diffraction fringe at angle to the normal of the grate by measure the angle of these fringe to the normal the correspond wavelength can be determine and subsequently the rydberg constant can also be determine the use of a spectrometer allows for a high degree of precision a it allows the angle of diffraction of light from the source to be measure to the order of arc-minutes the wavelength of a photon emit by a hydrogen atom be give by the rydberg formula 2 where λ be the wavelength of the photon emit r ∞ be the rydberg constant and p and n be principle quantum number which take integer value for the energy level that the atom transition to and from respectively for the spectrum of wavelength in the visible light spectrum know a the balmer series p 2 and n ≥ 3. therefore a graph of for n correspond to λ will exhibit a relation of direct proportionality with gradient equal to the rydberg constant r ∞ r ∞ can also be express a a product of other fundamental physical constant 2 where c be the speed of light in vacuum m e be the mass of the electron α be the fine structure constant and h be the planck constant use the measure value of these constant 1 we obtain a value of r ∞ to which the result obtain in this experiment may be compare of r ∞ 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 see section 7 the spectrometer u a diffraction grate to separate the light into it constituent wavelength for a diffraction grate with slit width d 1 d slit per metre where θ be the angle to the light incident on the grate through which the light be diffract λ be the wavelength of the light and m be the number of the fringe of diffract light from the centre the central fringe at θ 0 be m 0 and the first fringe from the centre correspond to m ±1 this can be see from figure 1 maximum point of constructive interference occur in the diffraction pattern when the path difference of light through neighbour slit d sin θ be equal to an integer multiple m of the wavelength λ give by mλ this allows the wavelength of light in a spectral line to be determine from the angle through which the light have be diffract reading the condition of the experiment and environment be kept a constant a possible the reading of the angle through which the fringe be diffract allow the wavelength of the spectral line of the three different measure colour to be determine the table of these reading be give in section 7. the error on each reading be due mostly to the spread of each fringe each fringe span 0.5 • vary for each fringe and due to uncertainty on the reading of the vernier scale the effect of air pressure temperature humidity etc have be neglect in correction on these result and a such have also be estimate and account for in the error on each reading graph of m against sin θ for each of the measure wavelength be give in figure 4. these graph suggest a direct proportionality relationship a be predict by equation 3 equation 3 predicts that the gradient of the line for each colour wavelength be give by gradient λ d where d be the distance between adjacent slit in the diffraction grate the inverse of the number of slit per metre therefore the product of the gradient of these line with the value of d 1 788003 m the manufacturer of the diffraction grate specifies approximately 78.8 line per millimetre with negligible error relative to other error in this experiment allow the first three emission wavelength of the balmer series to be calculate these wavelength be a follow be give in table 1 table 1 measure balmer series wavelength n λ n 3 650 × 10 −9 ± 10 × 10 −9 m 4 481 × 10 −9 ± 5 × 10 −9 m 5 342 × 10 −9 ± 7 × 10 −9 m equation 1 predicts that the gradient of the graph of λ against n be give in figure 5 the gradient of this line be 1.10 × 10 7 ± 1 × 10 5 m −1 and therefore the result be that the rydberg constant have be measure to be the error on this result could be low significantly with the spectrometer experimental set-up in particular this experiment take no repeat reading due to time constraint but do so would reduce the error similarly take reading to high value of m and take reading for more than three of the wavelength in the spectrum would reduce the error significantly the error on each angle reading could be reduce far if the focus of the spectrometer be improve and the slit narrow make each fringe narrower this experiment set out measure the rydberg constant which relates the wavelength of photon emit by hydrogen to the transition in energy level of the hydrogen atom in emit these photon it do so by use of a spectrometer and diffraction grate measure the diffraction angle of the spectral line from a hydrogen lamp the value obtain for the rydberg constant be r ∞ 1.10 × 10 7 ± 1 × 10 5 m −1 which be in agreement with the theoretical calculation of the constant from other fundamental physical constant the error on this result be relatively high and the spectrometer set-up be capable of obtain result of great precision the error could be reduce in far experiment through repeat reading reading to high order diffraction fringe and reading from more wavelength from the spectrum most of all table 2 reading of angle of the m th diffraction fringe for each measure wavelength colour for comparison the value of r ∞ can be calculate from other fundamental physical constant 1 from equation 2 to be r ∞ 10 973 731.57 m −1 and the value provide by codata 1 with error on the constant be r ∞ 10 973 731.568 508 65 m −1 the table of reading of the angle of each

85,GS_OXY643_Redacted,he rydberg constant be one of the most important constant of atomic physic because of it connection with the fundamental atomic constant e h me c and because of the high accuracy with which it can be determine 1 the aim of this experiment be to produce a measurement for the rydberg constant use a pasco precision spectrometer this involve diffract light from a hydrogen discharge lamp connect to a power supply through a diffract grate the light produce by the lamp consists of photon with quantize wavelength correspond to the difference in the energy between the initial and final energy state of the atom the diffraction grate with a fix grate space cause these wavelength to spread out at angle with wavelength dependence to produce emission line spectrum which be visible through a telescope this set up enable u to determine the quantize wavelength from which we could then determine the rydberg constant the constant appear most notably in the bohr model of the atom to put it simply niels bohr postulate that the energy of an atom can take only certain value for which he won the nobel prize in 1922. when a photon of a particular energy be eject from an atom he found that the energy of the atom decrease by the same amount he reason that this be an atom make a transition to a low energy level with the energy of the photon equate the energy difference in the internal energy state of the initial and final state from the emission line spectrum he be able to deduce that many different wavelength be emit which correspond to the different transition between energy level in an atom and that the wavelength produce be unique to different element these transition be best described by electron transfer from a specific stable energy orbit about the

have not be consider it be determine that the function use to calculate the error on the gradient of the graph be incorrect in it error analysis and the correct error be calculate manually this turn out to be the importance of be able to measure the rydberg constant accurately be establish due to the work of three physicist johan balmer johannes rydberg and niels bohr the balmer formula be discover empirically by johann balmer when measure the spectrum of hydrogen with an incorporate empirical constant rydberg stumble upon the balmer formula for the hydrogen spectrum and realise that it agree with his own formula relate the wavelength of the spectrum of various chemical the rydberg constant first arose when rydberg recast balmer 's formula and he measure the constant a 109 721.6 cm -1 at this point it be still just an experimental constant bohr be able to express the rydberg constant a a product of other fundamental constant me e h and c thus show that the rydberg constant be fundamental the rydberg constant can be determine to a very high degree of accuracy use method such a use the saturable absorption technique to measure three of the fine-structure component of the hydrogen balmer-alpha line ref 2 the value have be measure to an accuracy of 7 part in 10 12 make it one of the most precisely measure physical constant in turn this give insight into the relative proportion of the other fundamental constant that constitute the rydberg constant it can be show use trigonometry that for a diffraction grate where d be the grate space θ the angle between an emerge ray and the normal to the grate m an integer represent the order of the beam and λ the wavelength of the wave this can be understood use the follow diagram when the eyepiece be be use to view the

spectrometer || blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk 1 be derive by use trigonometry to determine the path difference between the two ray in phase a can be see in fig 4 the error bar be quite large for most of the value with a very small error on the reading for the 0 th order this limit the error on the gradient despite the large error for the other reading the discrepancy between the error for each measure order should be negligible since the method use for each reading be identical this indicates that the amount of reading take be insufficient to stabilize the magnitude of the random error theoretically twelve value must be take to minimize the error to ± 0.2 nm see ref 3 suggest the two set of data collect be insufficient the initial error calculation use the built in `` linregress `` function in python 3.6 which do not account for the error bar on each reading but instead calculates the error of the regression fit by calculate the average random error on a reading and add it in quadrature with the error on the gradient the error remains at ± 1 × 10 5 m to one significant figure to comment far on the result more reading must be take less order be visible for the purple line when compare to the red and blue line with the 2 nd order beam be extremely faint this could also be a source of error which be n't account for the value of r∞ obtain by use the wavelength calculate by the blue light be 1.109 × 10 7 ± 3 × 10 4 m -1 the wavelength of the light that be calculate and use to find 𝑅 ∞ be 4.81 × 10 -9 ± 1 × 10 -9 m give by the follow graph the value of the gradient be 0.144 to three significant figure with the same percentage error a the wavelength because the error on the gradient only come from d and λ. the error on d be unknown so the error on λ only come from the error on the gradient the same correction to the calculate error for the wavelength of the blue light must be consider due to the inconsistency of the error bar which lead to an improve error of ± 5 × 10 4 m -1 for r∞ for the red light a value of r∞ record be 1.129× 10 7 ± 8 × 10 4 m -1 with the wavelength be record a 6.38 × 10 -7 ± 8 × 10 4 m take from the follow

of 1.112 × 10 7 ± 1.3 × 10 5 m -1 there be a 0.99 error but the percentage difference be 1.34 it be this discrepancy that motivate far error analysis to see where the error be be underestimated which be found to be the lack of incorporation of the error bar in the python function use a state previously correct this an error of ± 140,000 to two significant figure lead to a percentage error of 1.26 this be still low than expect but this discrepancy be likely due to the lack of far repeat data set another source of error which may contribute to the discrepancy be the accidental adjustment of the apparatus which could have misalign the collimator grate or the vernier scale the width of the spectral line depend on the width of the slit and focus of the collimator this be adjust until the line be a thin a possible without become difficult to view in the eyepiece there be a random error when align the telescope on the rotational axis because the cross hair may lie on a slightly different position with each measure spectral line estimation must be use to far increase the accuracy of the random error on r∞ the error on the thickness of the spectral line can be approximate to ± 15 arcminute since the width of the spectral line be about 30 arcminute the error on the misalignment of the spectrometer be estimate to be ± 5 arcminute incorporate this into the error on the final value of r∞ give an error of ± 1.6 × 10 5 m -1 which give a percentage error of 1.42 which encompasses the actual value grate spectroscopy a a method be able to calculate a very precise value of the rydberg constant even though bohr 's theory of the atom which be assume in section ii do n't give a full explanation of the energy level of all atom it do give a very accurate prediction for the energy level of a hydrogen atom the high precision of the method use suggests the error and lack of far precision be not due to the method but due to other factor the vernier scale use be also very

87,GS_SCO219_Redacted,an investigation be carry out use grate spectrometry and balmer line from a hydrogen lamp to determine the value of rydberg 's constant use rydberg 's formula equation 1 know value for energy level and measure value for the wavelength of the emission line a value for r be obtain the value and associate error for r obtain be 1.083 × 10 7 ± 3.562 × 10 3 m −1 ±0.0329 although the error for r be apparently low because of the high precision of the spectrometer use compare this to the accepted value of r 1.097×10 7 m −1 4 it be note that the accepted value do not lie within the error bound of our calculate result this be likely to due the poor alignment of the grate and the potentially incorrect value for d. before johannes rydberg have developed his famous equation johann balmer investigate spectral line from hydrogen and deduce his equation which be applicable to energy state transition to the n=2 state it be only on the 5 th of november 1888 that johannes rydberg have generalise balmer 's equation so that it be applicable to any energy state transition in a hydrogen atom and therefore any hydrogen-like atom where λ be the wavelength of the light emit r be the rydberg constant and n 1 and n 2 be the initial and final energy level respectively the rydberg equation give u a very accurate way of calculate the wavelength of the photon release when an electron in a hydrogen atom de-excites to a low energy level exploration of hydrogen emission line have proven to be very important in the development of modern physic consider the fact hydrogen make up 75 of the element in our universe moreover the development of the rydberg equation lead to bohr 's model of the atom and the quantum revolution in this investigation the balmer line will be explore this be because some of the balmer line have wavelength which lie in the visible region whereas lyman line n 2 1 and paschen line n 2 3 have wavelength which lie in the infra-red and ultra-violet region respectively a diffraction grate spectrometer will be use to analyse the spectral line to obtain the constituent wavelength of light from a hydrogen lamp use these wavelength and rydberg 's formula equation 1 we can deduce an experimental value for r. when a hydrogen lamp be connect to a power source and turn on light of specific wavelength be emit a the high-energy electron pa through the hydrogen gas they interact with the hydrogen atom and cause them to excite once the electron in the hydrogen shell be in the high energy state it then naturally de-excites to a low energy state release a photon in the process the energy of the photon release upon de-excitation be equal to the energy change of the electron across the two energy state the equation that relates the energy level change in hydrogen to the wavelength of light release be call the rydberg equation -see equation 1. sometimes the rydberg constant be write a r ∞ where the '∞ indicates that we be assume that the mass of the electron be negligible compare to that of the hydrogen nucleus 3 the rydberg constant itself can also be express a a series of constant a publish by bohr in 1913 -see equation 2. m e e 4 8e 2 0 h 3 c 2 balmer line occur when the electron in hydrogen fall from high energy level to the second energy level therefore in the case for balmer line n 2 2. see figure 1 4 for a visual representation of the process since the photon release be in the visible part of the electromagnetic em spectrum one would be able to see the light from a hydrogen lamp with the naked eye it be indeed the case that at least three of the balmer emission line be visible to the human eye through a grate spectrometer when light pas through the diffraction grate in the grate spectrometer it get split into it constituent colour this because successive maximum and minimum occur for each wavelength of light a constructive and destructive interference occurs it can be easily deduce 1 that for a diffraction grate with slit separation d and light of wavelength λ the fringe space θ be give by equation 3 3 experimental method the observation of the balmer spectral line be carry out use a grate spectrometer 2 the eyepiece lens be adjust by adjust the focus while observe a distant image the collimator lens be a adjust so that a sharp image of the central maximum be observe through the eyepiece lens the adjustment of the collimator ensure that the light travel through the collimator a a parallel beam after calibration no adjustment be make to the lens for the remainder of the experiment the hydrogen lamp be place directly in front of the spectrometer slit in order that a much light pas through the slit a possible to give emission line that be a prominent a possible the diffraction grate of 78.8 slit per millimetre be place in the centre of the spectrometer the slit width be increase to allow more light through to locate the approximate position of the fringe the slit be then narrow so that it be a small a possible while still allow enough light through so that the spectral line be visible to reduce the uncertainty for the measurement the slit width be not adjust for the remainder of the experiment to measure the position of the fringe θ for each wavelength the cross-hair on the eyepiece be directly above the centre of the fringe four measurement of this angle be make and the average space for each wavelength be calculate although there be technically six balmer line which lie in the visible part of the em spectrum only three of these line be visible under the condition of the laboratory this be perhaps due to external light in the laboratory such a that from desk lamp enter through the eyepiece or collimator cause the emission line to appear fainter the colour observe be red aqua and purple there be clearly distinguishable and these colour would not cause confusion when observe the emission line where n 2 2 and n 1 which be the element of the rydberg equation to produce a linear plot for find r. the gradient of the graph give u a value for r the rydberg constant four reading for the spectrometer angle be take for each maximum and the standard deviation be calculate so a to obtain an error associate with each value of the spectrometer angle these error tend to be very low which be why the error bar be virtually invisible on the graph show in figure 3. the graph give value for θ with very little error this be expect consider the quality of the result obtain the point fit very well with the best-fit line the value for θ a we previously have establish be related to the wavelength λ by equation 3. this mean that we can calculate the value for λ for each value of θ. the error be calculate use the fact that the error of sin θ be co θ × σ θ the error of sin θ be then add by quadrature to the error of d. the inverse of λ be then found in order that we have a linear plot when we plot λ −1 against the factor f .the correspond value of f 1 for each colour be then calculate and all the relevant data be show in table 1. table 1 vale of spectrometer diffraction angle θ and inverse of wavelength λ −1 and their associate error and the energy level change factor f for each colour of the balmer emission line from the hydrogen lamp balmer line colour θ/degrees figure 4 show the graph produce when λ −1 be plot against the correspond value of f the gradient of the graph give a value for r the rydberg constant the calculate value for r and it error be 1.083 × 10 7 ± 3.562 × 10 3 m −1 ±0.0329 the accepted value for the rydberg constant be 1.097×10 7 m −1 5 so it be clear to see that this accepted value do not lie in the bound of our experimentally produce value the percentage error for the experimental result be very small 0.0329 the very high precision of the spectrometer provide very small room for random error this be evident in the graph which have point which correlate with each other very closely only a single point on the aqua emission line graph show in figure 3 do not fit on the line of best-fit despite the low error chance of random error the final result be 1.28 different from the accepted value of r. however this be very likely to be because of a systematic error during the experimental procedure consider the value for λ that have be calculate be high than the accepted value for the balmer line this be displayed in table 2. here we can see that for b α and b γ the percentage difference be similar this suggests a possibility of a systematic error which provokes a high measurement for the value of λ. nonetheless we can not say this with certainty because the measure value for b β be small than the accepted value a potential source of error be the value for d the diffraction grate line space the value be not experimentally test during this investigation it be simply quote a 78.8 line per millimetre and thus an estimate of the error have to be make to test this value for d a light source of know wavelength such a a laser or a sodium light source should be shone through the spectrometer while use the same diffraction grate and the fringe space be measure consider the fact that for b α and b γ the wavelength be great than the true value it be possible that the fringe space be great than the value for d use 1.27×10 −5 m another source of error may have be the alignment of the diffraction grate during the experiment the diffraction grate be place perpendicular to the light source and hence to the collimator however have the grate be slightly rotate the calculate value for λ would have be different equation 4 1 show the more precise way to calculate the wavelength where d be the slit separation λ be the wavelength θ i be the angle of the light source to the grate normal and θ be the fringe space it be therefore very important to ensure that the grate be perpendicular to the source at all time discrete balmer emission line be use in this investigation to determine a value for rydberg 's constant r. light from a hydrogen lamp be analyse use a grate spectrometer with 78.8 line per millimetre the value for the fringe space appear to correlate very well with each other thanks to the very high precision of the equipment use the value and associate error for r obtain be 1.083 × 10 7 ± 3.562 × 10 3 m −1 ±0.0329 although the error for r be apparently low compare this to the

relate to the ionisation energy of specie the rydberg unit of energy denote r y rydberg atom and rydberg molecule be all example of these it be very relevant in current research and in 2016 researcher from the kaiserslautern university of technology and purdue university observe `` butterfly rydberg molecule `` where there be a weak pair of a rydberg atom with a separate atom in the ground state 3 r ∞ and the rydberg formula both arise from rutherford-bohr model an approximation of the structure of the atom it can also be described in term of more fundamental constant although the most accurate measurement of the rydberg constant come from measure it constituent and more fundamental constant our investigation be to find the rydberg constant through the measurement of transition wavelength in hydrogen a this be far easy to perform in a laboratory these wavelength come from a relatively simple formula know a the rydberg formula an equation which relates the wavelength of emit photon to the initial and final energy level of the atom they come from for a hydrogen atom the wavelength of light emit from an atom with a final energy level of 2 and an initial energy level of 3,4,5 etc fall within the visible region of electromagnetic radiation this series of wavelength be know a the balmer series after johann balmer a swiss mathematician and physicist who discover them and an equation to calculate them in 1885. due to the abundance of hydrogen in the universe this series be especially useful in astronomy these balmer line can appear a either absorption or emission line depend on the source for our experiment a hydrogen lamp be use and so emission line be observe and measure the emission line from the hydrogen lamp be analyse with a grate spectrometer this comprises of a collimator that pas light normally through a diffraction grate disperse the spectral line the angle of diffraction of these spectral line be then measure use an eyepiece that rotates freely about the grate fig 2. the grate spectrometer be use because of it high precision and accuracy enable the measurement of the wavelength of a give sample of light to nanometer precision once the value of the wavelength be know the rydberg formula can be use to find the rydberg constant by graphical analysis the rutherford-bohr model be one of the simplest approximation of the structure of the atom apply mostly classical physic in this model the electron orbit around the nucleus in the same way that planet orbit around a star if we consider an electron orbit a hydrogen nucleus it total energy must be described by where e be the total energy of the electron v be the potential energy of the electron and t be the kinetic energy of the electron a the only force between the nucleus and the electron in the model be the electromagnetic force it can be show that this total energy be give by where k be 4π 0 −1 with 0 be the permittivity of free space e be the magnitude of the charge of an electron and r be the radius of the `` orbit `` of the electron it can also be show that the angular momentum of the electron must be quantise and so combine these discrete value of velocity with the equivalence of centripetal and electrostatic force we find where n be an integer arise from the quantisation of angular momentum and m e be the mass of the electron when n 1 r give the bohr radius substitute this back into equation 1 we get an expression for the total energy of a give energy level n a an electron jump from a high energy level to a low one the difference in energy between these two level be emit a a photon see fig 1. equate this energy difference to the energy of a photon give where λ be the wavelength of the emit photon n 2 be the initial energy level n 1 be the final energy level make n 1 n 2 and r ∞ be the rydberg constant give by where c be the speed of light in a vacuum h be plank 's constant and α be the fine structure constant 4 give by it be from this definition of the rydberg constant that the high accuracy measurement have be make however a λ n 1 and n 2 be know it be not need for this experiment allow the use of equation 5 directly in derive the total energy of the electron it be assume that the mass of the nucleus when compare to the electron be infinite denote by the subscript ∞ consider a finite ratio between the two mass coffman show 5 that the formula becomes where with m e be the mass of the electron and m be the total mass of the nucleus although not necessary for this particular experiment the rydberg formula can also be expand to describe other element that behave in a similar manner to hydrogen with the formula where z be the atomic number of the element if we take equation 5 rearrange for λ use the accepted value of r ∞ a 1.0974 × 10 7 m

first four spectral line be in the visible spectrum and so can be detect by the human eye all other line with these parameter lie in the ultraviolet region this series of spectral line with n 1 2 be know a the balmer series although more in depth analysis of the diffraction grate be possible for determination of resolution and to show the presence of secondary peak only the principal maximum be use in this experiment if an arbitrary point be consider that be illuminate by a diffraction grate a principal maximum will only occur if the path difference between neighbour slit to the give point be an integer multiple of 2π this mean that the phase difference φ be give by where s be the path difference between adjacent slit k be the wavenumber and m be a positive or negative integer a s d sin θ and k 2π λ then give and so through measurement of θ and m with the grate spectrometer determination of λ be possible for a give colour these value of λ can then be use with equation 5 to find r ∞ before start the experiment equation 5 be use along with the accepted value of the rydberg constant to calculate the expect wavelength of the first five spectral line of the balmer series table i. these wavelength be then convert into visible colour with colour chart from these value it be predict that all line with n 2 ≥ 5 would be in the ultraviolet range and so it be expect that four line would be visible to the eye the hydrogen lamp use to produce the spectral line would overheat if left on for more than approximately 15 minute when this occurs the lamp no longer produce accurate spectral line and will not turn on before cool to low temperature in extreme case this can cause permanent damage to the lamp for this reason the initial calibration of the grate spectrometer be do use a sodium lamp a a substitute this be use a the sodium lamp produce clear spectral line in a similar manner to the hydrogen lamp whilst not suffer from overheat the collimator and diffraction grate see fig 2 have to be perfectly align to ensure light would be incident normally on the diffraction grate minimise the error in the position reading the eyepiece be first focus on the cross-hair with an object 5-10m away the opposite wall of the laboratory be use the collimator be then calibrate by adjust the focus of the collimator until the source through the slit be at it sharpest a see through the eyepiece the slit width be minimise but not so much that the observe spectral line become hard to view the purpose of these step be both to minimise eye strain and to minimise the spread in the spectral line minimise the error in θ. the camera be then rotate by exactly 90 • and a mirror use in place of the diffraction grate to precisely align the diffraction grate mount the diffraction grate use have 2001 line per inch approximately 78.8 line per mm it be predict that four wavelength would be visible when use the hydrogen lamp table i. however initially only the red and aqua line be observe upon replace the hydrogen lamp the red aqua and violet spectral line be then visible but not dark blue from discussion with other team it become apparent that many lamp be not show all of the expect spectral line and so we decide to use the lamp despite only be able to observe three wavelength the cause of this be unknown however it be likely due to fig 2. a simplify top-down

increase θ be decide to be of increase order and vice versa when the brightness of the line be such that their colour could not be determine with relative ease their position be no longer record to reduce the chance of the lamp overheat due to prolong usage reading be take for period of 5-10 minute with break of a few minute in between to allow to the lamp to cool to obtain a quantitative measurement of the error in the position of the spectral line the width of the 0 th order line of each colour be directly measure for later use see section iv-b this be do by take two position measurement one for each side of the fringe the wavelength of each spectral line be found from equation 13. this give λ a the gradient of the plot of d sin θ against m fig 3. the value of the calculate gradient in table ii all contain the expect value of λ from table i within their associate margin of error equation 5 be then use with the value of λ and n 2 from table ii to calculate the rydberg constant fig 4. through swap the two reciprocal term of n 2 1 an n 2 2 the gradient becomes r ∞ this give r ∞ to be 1.096×10 7 ±1.4×10 5 m −1 the accepted value of r ∞ be 1.0974 × 10 7 m −1 meaning that the calculate result be 0.1σ from the accepted value the main source of error within the dataset be from the human judgement of the centre of the spectral line to quantify this rather than estimate an uncertainty the width of an individual fringe of each wavelength be measure see section iii-b through subtract the great of these two angle from the other and combine the error for each in quadrature the total width of the line could be found halve the width and then combine this with it associate error in quadrature give the total error in each line position measurement for each wavelength see table iii this spread of each line be cause by the finite width of the slit and the diffraction of the light a it pas through it this effect be far amplify by any error in the focus of the collimator and the camera lens arrangement lead to a small but measurable spread in the observe position of each line error in the calibration of the grate spectrometer i.e the light not be normally incident on the diffraction grate also lead to systematic error in the line position these effect be mostly remove by use of a linear regression model all far calculate error be found from these line of regression initially the calculate wavelength of the violet light be found to be great than that of the aqua colour it be widely i. this meant that n 1 2 and n 2 3 4 and 6 a dark blue be not observe the gradient r∞ be found to be 1.096 × 10 7 ± 1.4 × 10 5 m −1 accepted that this be not true upon inspection of the violet data fig 5 it be found that at the two end of the dataset the position deviate dramatically whereas the central section remain linear and closely match the expect value upon remove these anomalous data point the gradient of the trend line of the central data point give a value far closer to the expect value calculate beforehand this new value be use in the calculation of r ∞ the cause of these peculiar anomaly may have be down to mis-association of the colour to the record line position a the brightness of the line decrease with distance from the central line this could explain why only the outermost line be anomalous many other dark line be observe however a their colour could not be determine accurately they be not record overall the error in the final result be reasonable consider it be found from only three data point fig 4. ideally all four wavelength would have be visible and repeat measurement of each spectral line would have be take to far reduce the error in r ∞ unfortunately due to the lack of another replacement hydrogen lamp and the lack of laboratory time allocate this be not possible both of these factor greatly increase the error in the final value the aim of the experiment be to find the rydberg constant through measurement of the spectral line of the balmer series through use of the rydberg formula r ∞ be found to be 1.096 × 10 7 ± 1.4 × 10 5 m −1 this be 0.1σ from the accepted value of 1.0974 × 10 7 m −1 this final error be mainly due to the lack of repeat be take and due to only three of the four wavelength be visible in future the accuracy of the experiment could have be greatly improve through address these issue the knowledge and experience gain through use of the grate spectrometer and through work a a team to gather meaningful data from it can and will be directly apply to future

89,GS_XUQ367_Redacted,in this investigation we be determine the rydberg constant use hydrogen lamp and spectrometer we estimate the constant to be 1.046±0.022x𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 the accepted value for the constant be 1.097x𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 therefore the experiment be 4.65 accurate in the experiment we use a spectrometer and hydrogen lamp the spectrometer be an effective way to determine wavelength of light precisely and accurately by measure wavelength of the light that be emit from a hydrogen lamp we can determine the rydberg constant a the wavelength of light emit related to the rydberg formula for one of the wavelength measure we gain an anomalous result that be not part of any model in the rydberg formula although measurement for the other two wavelength do fit the model that the rydberg formula provide for this experiment we be determine the rydberg constant by observe the diffraction pattern when a beam of light from the emission of a hydrogen lamp be shone through a diffraction grate the light from a hydrogen lamp be not make up of a continuous spectrum of light but of distinct colour the distinct colour be due to the quantisation of energy level in electron in the hydrogen atom a the hydrogen gas be excite the electron in the hydrogen be promote energy level that be distinct and quantise see appendix a for diagram when the electron lose energy they be demote energy level and release a photon of light a the difference in energy level be distinct and not continuous only photon of certain wavelength be emit these wavelength can be estimate use spectroscopy technique the wavelength relates to the rydberg constant and the energy level the electron be promote to in the experiment the wavelength be determine use spectroscopy technique from multiple grate diffraction theory the wavelength of light can be estimate for the light emit and from this the rydberg constant be estimate the rydberg constant be very important in atomic physic and even in astrophysics the rydberg constant can predict the wavelength of light emit for hydrogen and ionise element with the same number of electron a hydrogen the rydberg constant can be use to model wavelength of photon emit in excite hydrogen thus it have important application in astrophysics by observe light from star or any other celestial body astronomer can shine the light through a grate similar to the one we use in the experiment can confirm presence of hydrogen 1 to determine the rydberg constant the value of the wavelength emit from the excite hydrogen must be estimate this be do by a graph the graph be sin theta against order of maximum this mean that the gradient be equivalent to the wavelength of light emit the light observe be red cyan green and blue with wavelength calculate to be 487.2±7.3nm 659.3±2.7nm 532.6±9.6nm respectively from this we get the rydberg constant to measure 1.046±0.022x10 7 𝑚 −1 this experiment u multiple grate diffraction theory to estimate the wavelength of the emit light the grate be make of equally space narrow slit each with a distance between them of d. suppose there be phase difference of neighbour ray of wavelength λ if the phase difference be an integer multiple of 2π then there be constructive interference of maximum intensity a show in appendix b the path difference be dsinθ the phase difference be calculate by 1 where ϕ be the phase difference a we be interested in the diffraction pattern for when there be a maximum constructive interference we know that ϕ be equivalent to 2πm where m=0 ±1 ±2 .. etc therefore we can equate 1.1 to 1.2 determine the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and spectrometer by cancel the 2π term and multiply by λ we derive 1.3 which we use for the analysis of result for the spectrometer 1.3 λ be related to the rydberg constant by 1.4 2 this be due to quantum effect of the electron in the hydrogen atom the electron in the hydrogen atom be at specific energy level when the hydrogen atom be in an excite state the electron be raise by an energy level or to even high specific energy level once the hydrogen atom be not in an excite state the electron in the excite state demotes an energy level when this happens photon be emit from the atom the energy of this photon be equivalent to the difference in energy of the electron energy level therefore in 1.4 p equal the final energy level and n equal the energy level of the electron in the excite state for visible light to be emit the electron 's final state be in the p=2 state any high would result in the photon be emit have a wavelength in the region of infrared light if the final state be low the photon will be in the uv spectrum in the experiment we be determine the wavelength of the light emit we research the balmer series for hydrogen appendix b so n and p be know 4 rearrange 1.4 can give a result for the rydberg constant iii method figure 1 show an example of a very similar spectrometer use 3 the slow motion drive or rotate table varies the angle of the eyepiece with cross hair the cross hair be line up with maximas when the angle θ be measure on the slow motion drive a the spectral line be of a certain thickness due to the slit before the collimator this provide an uncertainty in θ. we determine the uncertainty to be half the thickness of the spectral line a the true angle of maximum could lie within the region of the spectral line at the central maximum θ=0 and this be the point where the eye piece and the collimator where completely parallel to each other it be also require that the plane of the grate be exactly perpendicular to the collimator and be perfectly level this be so that 1.3 be valid we make sure that this be the case by the follow step first we align the eyepiece with the collimator without put in the diffraction grate next we rotate the eyepiece by 90˚ and clamped it into position the eyepiece and collimator be therefore perpendicular to each other we then place the grate in the holder and rotate it until we could see the reflect image of the slit align with the cross hair of the eyepiece this meant that now the grate be at an angle of 45˚ a show by figure 3. when this point be reach we rotate the grate by exactly 45 degree this assure that the grate plane be perpendicular to the light beam come out the collimator the eye piece be then rotate 90 degree exactly so that the eye piece and telescope axis be parallel to the light beam to obtain value of theta the telescope be rotate use the fine adjustment screw on the rotate table and the value of theta be read off on a vernier scale the vernier scale have a precision of 1 arc minute the hydrogen lamp be not like other lamp and can not be kept on for a long time we estimate the rydberg constant to be 1.046±0.022x10 7 𝑚 −1 this be close to the accepted value of 1.097x10 7 𝑚 −1 2 we observe the hydrogen to emit three distinct colour blue red and cyan green with wavelength 487.2±2.3nm 659.3±2.7nm 532.6±3.6nm respectively below show a graph of sin θ a a function of m. there be a strong linear fit with the graph and small uncertainty in value of sin θ for each of the colour the gradient of this graph be equivalent to the wavelength of the light divide by the distance between the slit grate there be small uncertainty with the estimation of the wavelength when research the balmer series 4 the value of the wavelength for light emit be similar for the blue and red spectral line for the red light beam the wavelength be meant to be 656.1nm which be very close to our value of 659.3nm and for the blue light beam the wavelength be meant to be 486.0nm which be again close to our estimate value of 487.2nm however the presence of light with the 532.6nm wavelength be not part of the balmer series this result be also not due to one anomalous result a the graph show a strong linear fit with each of the distinct colour a possible cause for this be that there be another light source go through the diffraction pattern but this seem unlikely a the measurement of the wavelength for this light be very precise and if this be the case it would have have to be a laser therefore we do not calculate the rydberg constant for this light beam when we estimate the rydberg constant we obtain value for the rydberg constant for the individual light beam and take the mean a the result infront of the collimator be a slit that make the light source a light beam however the slit have certain thickness and provide an uncertainty in theta a the light beam have a certain thickness we estimate the result of theta a the central part of the beam to measure the uncertainty we record theta the edge of the ligh tbeam the uncertainty be the difference in theta for the edge of the light beam and we divide this by a half below show a visualisation of the measurement of the uncertainty,extended,none
90,GS_GTD911_Redacted,"the emission spectrum of hot hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the visible transition wavelength which lie on balmer series be observe and measure the rydberg constant r∞ which relates the energy level in the atom to the transition wavelength be calculate the value of r∞ obtain be 1.10±0.04 × 10 7 m -1 the result be what we expect and it also verifies the rydberg formula spectroscopy be the study of electromagnetic spectrum which be the wavelength composition of light due to atomic and molecular interaction a grate spectrometer u a diffract grate to disperse the incident polychromatic light into it constituent monochromatic component 3 in this experiment the emission spectrum of hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the rydberg formula explains the relation between the transition wavelength and the energy level with the proportionality constant be the rydberg constant the information about the wavelength of the emission spectrum be use to deduce the rydberg constant the word spectrum be first apply by isaac newton to describe the rainbow of colour that combine to form white light during the early 1800s joseph von fraunhofer conduct experiment with dispersive spectrometer that enable spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique 4 since then spectroscopy have become important in the study of physic and it be equally crucial in the astronomical biological chemical metallurgical and other analytical investigation 3 figure 2.0 show the electromagnetic spectrum of light that range from radio wave to gamma ray correspond to their wavelength 8 the electromagnetic spectrum can be anything from long infrared all the way down to gamma ray a show by figure 2.0. the light might have originate from anything from a cool crystal to a superhot plasma or from a star 1 the light spectrum generally take one of two form firstly hot solid such a a tungsten lamp filament emits a continuous spectrum of intensity that vary with wavelength secondly hot or electrically excite gas release spectrum that have concentrate emission at a few well-defined wavelength a see from the slit of the spectrometer a show by figure 2.1. this form be call 'emission line spectrum the ratio of intensity of spectral line for example can provide information about the density of the emit gas or the density of the free electron in an electrical discharge since the spectroscopy be a `` non-invasive `` technique it be one of the most powerful tool available to physicist 1 figure 2.1. show the emission spectrum of various element these line have well define position which correspond to well-defined wavelength 9 these gas also show 'absorption line spectrum which occurs when a continuous white light be pas through their cool state instead of emit spectral line the gas absorb the well-defined wavelength of light and reemit in random direction result in dark line in a continuous spectrum a see in figure 2.2 2 however the focus of the experiment will be on the emission line spectrum of hot hydrogen lamp determine the rydberg constant use the grate spectrometer the absorption spectrum of helium with well-defined dark line on the continuous spectrum of white light 10 a spectrometer need a dispersive object to disperse or separate the different wavelength of the incident light spatially 3 in our experiment we use a diffraction grate diffraction be a wave phenomenon that occurs when a wave encounter an obstacle or a slit 2 a grate can be consider a a large n of equally space very narrow slit 1 each slit be separate by a distance d 1 where m be the order number 1,2 here m take value of 0 1 and 2. in this experiment the value at the opposite direction take negative value such -1 and -2. the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen be divide into a number of spectral series spectral emission occurs when an electron transition from a high energy state to a low energy state to differentiate the two state the low energy state be designate a p and the high energy state be designate a n. since the energy of each state be fix the energy difference between the state be fix and the transition will always produce a photon with the same energy 5 hydrogen atom correspond to the wavelength of the photon emit 13 this experiment focus on balmer series since lyman series and paschen series do not involve photon that lie in the visible range so the value of p in this case be 2. the energy difference between level and hence the wavelength of emit photon be give by the rydberg formula 5 where r∞ be the rydberg constant which have the measure value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 it can be express in term of more fundamental constant a where me be the mass of electron c be the speed of light h be plank 's constant and α be the fine structure constant the value of 1/α ≈ 137.036 1,6 before proceed to make measurement the spectrometer be first properly alinged and focus firstly the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire `` x `` to find a set that do not strain the eye the instrument be brought outside the work space to a window the camera lens be focus so that a distant object be focus on the cross wire the distant object chosen be another window across the street since the distant in this context mean 5 to 10 metre 1 the telescope be set so that it be alinged with the axis of the collimator the hydrogen lamp be position close to the slit so that it be illuminate without change the camera focus the focus of the collimator be adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire the slit be adjust to it minimum width and the cross wire be set a an `` x `` rather than a a `` `` it be checked how the clamp screw and the slow motion drive work the camera and collimator be alinged so the cross wire be set on the slit image the telescope be move through precisely 90 deg by note the intial and final position on the vernier scale and clamped in position a mirror be put in the holder and the ruling be ensure approximately vertical the grate table that hold the mirror be turn until a reflect image of the slit be observe in the eyepiece this indicates the grate surface be at 45 deg to the incident from the collimator the height of this image be adjust use the adjustment screw under the grate table the reading be note the grate be rotate through precisely 45 degree use the scale so that it be accurately set at 0 deg normal incidence the mirror be replace with a grate slit the telescope be then move out of the way and look into the grate the telescope be move around to find the diffract image of the slit if the image be above or below the plane define by the cross wire the grate adjustment screw be use to rotate the grate in the plane of it surface until the image be at right height the spectrometer be now set up to make measurement the hydrogen lamp be only switch on whenever the measurement be go to be make since it get hots and the intensity of the emission line drop until they be not visible in the eyepiece the grate slit that have 78.8 line per mm 1 be chosen since it show more emission line up to 3 order number the hydrogen lamp be turn on and the diffract image be observe in the eyepiece the position of the centre of the diffration pattern be measure here the centre represent the zeroth order in the grate equation i.e eq 2.2. the first order m=1 of emission line be observe in the first order one of the emission line look red and it position be record the step above be repeat for the second and third order and the order in the opposite direction the second visible wavelength be blue the position of the blue emission line be measure in the same manner a red 's the third visible emission line look bluish purple however the intensity of the third emission line be very low so the grate slit be change to another one with 300 line per mm 1 which provide high resolution but only the first and second order can be observe my partner and i take reading of the position of the same line alteratively to get a value for the uncertainty in the angle turn θ. the entire measure process be repeat multiple time for the three different emission line to increase the accuracy all reading be record on the lab book and then transfer to the computer to be analyse eq 2.2 implies a plot of the sin θ vs. m will yield a straight line a plot of sin θ a a function of m be plot on python for each transition wavelength use the information about the slope the wavelength of each emission line be determine with their uncertainty for each wavelength the rydberg constant be deduce with it uncertainty the plot of sin θ vs. m be plot on python for each transition wavelength the slope of the plot from figure 4.3 be 0.1294±0.0008 the d use be 3.33 × 10 -6 m. this be different from those use for previous plot since the grate slit be change for well resolution the wavelength of the emission line obtain be 4.3±0.1 × 10 -7 m. the error in the angle of the emission line θ for each transition wavelength be calculate from the standard deviation of the data the error in the wavelength for purple emission line be increase to 0.1×10 -7 m from a very small error since the intensity of the line be very low i suspect the error be big than the value obtain from standard deviation in summary the transition wavelength be give on the table below by compare the colour observe with the figure 2.6 the result be very similar visually but the second emission line be actually aqua light blue and the third one be blue not purple apart from that the wavelength do correspond to the colour observe in figure 2.6. also the forth emission line violet which be suppose to be visible be not observe this could be due to low intensity of the hydrogen lamp provide the rydberg constant r∞ be calculate for each transition wavelength by use eq 2.3. since the spectral line on balmer series be of the visible wavelength the wavelength obtain from the experiment correspond to the balmer series therefore the value of p energy level of the final level in this experiment be 2. the result be summarise by the table below colour n λ 10 -7 m r∞ 10 the average of the value of r∞ obtain be 1.10±0.04 × 10 7 m -1 the percentage difference when compare to the measure value be 0.2 the measure value also lie within the range of the average 1.06,1.14 × 10 7 m -1 the error in the average be relatively large thus result in a large range however the measure value be very close to the average there be a few possible source of error which could have affected the final result for example the hydrogen lamp get hot and the intensity drop make it difficult to spot the line we also change the lamp for a few time and the position of the lamp might have be change sometimes the whole set up be move by accident which could have cause the set up to be misalingned hence a set up fix to table must be use with a well long last hydrogen lamp even though the experiment be carry out in a dark room there be table lamp on our neighbour table which could have affected the incident light into the diffraction grate therefore an opaque shield should be use to cover it leave a hole for the eyepiece besides the grate holder could have be move during the change of the grate slit the temperature and humidity be possible error source too since they can affect the system optic 3 therefore the temperature and humidity should be monitor and regulate during the experiment the emission spectrum produce by hot hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the visible transition wavelength which lie on balmer series be observe and measure the rydberg constant r∞ which relates the energy level in the atom to the transition wavelength be calculate the value of r∞ obtain be 1.10±0.04 × 10 7 m -1 when compare to the measure value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 the percentage difference be 0.2 the result be what we expect this also verifies the rydberg formula i.e eq 2.3. it should be note that the grate spectrometer be highly accurate and the lab script claim to give a precision of ±0.2nm for the wavelength of yelloworange light if repeat measurement be take 1 since the small error in λ we can achieve be ±4nm we be still a long way from reach the uncertainty of ±0.2nm therefore the experiment should be repeat multiple time with more careful procedure consider the step discus in the previous section apart from that this experiment only investigates the visible transition wavelength of hydrogen i.e balmer series the other spectral line such a those from lyman series and paschen series should be study and be use to determine the rydberg constant a they be also related to it by eq 2.3 5 besides hydrogen any hydrogen-like element can be use to determine r∞ too 5",extended,bal

93,GS_CTW087_Redacted,the purpose of this report be to display the result of my experiment in which i attempt to calculate the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer the rydberg constant be a value which relates the frequency of photon emission which result from the transition of electron between discrete energy level in the atom the measurement be take use a collimator and a camera fit to a vernier scale with the use of a diffraction grate with 300 line per mm the final result of the experiment be 1.1005±0.0004 𝒎 −𝟏 this value be within less than 0.5 of the previously know value make the experiment successful pectroscopy be an extremely useful tool for scientific analysis it be a non-invasive technique which u light from a source to analyse the property of a substance or material the absorption or emission spectrum of the analyse material can provide key insight into the composition of the substance a specific element and compound have specific spectrum which they can absorb or emit for the purpose of this experiment hot hydrogen gas be use and it emission line be observe through a diffraction grate the eventual outcome of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant by use the relationship between wavelength and the degree of diffraction to calculate the wavelength of the light which the lamp emits the rydberg constant relates the wavelength of emit photon from a hydrogen atom for electron transmission between energy level for the purpose of this experiment a it be do by human observation the balmer emission series be use a it produce visible wavelength of light to calculate the wavelength of the light a spectrometer be use comprise of a collimator camera and vernier scale moreover the error in the calculate value be often on the order of a percent due to the precision of spectroscopy a a method however the rydberg constant can be use to calculate the wavelength of light emit from electron transition between any energy level outline below be additional theory which be require to understand the full detail of how the experiment work regard diffraction grate and the rydberg constant the diffraction grate can be assume to be a set of parallel narrow slit with separation d. thus if light of wavelength λ pas through a the grate a principle maximum occurs when all of the beam have a path difference which be a whole number of wavelength hence phase difference between adjacent wave be an integer multiple of 2π a show in equation 1.1 a path difference be 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 where θ be the deflection from the ray initial path then it follow hence plot 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against 𝜆 produce a straight line from which the gradient can be use to get an accurate value of 𝜆. the rydberg equation be a direct outcome of the quantum behaviour of electron a they can only occupy discrete energy level in the atom when electron in the hydrogen atom transition between energy level from high to low they release photon a the transition energy be discrete only certain wavelength of light be emit the equation 2.1 relates this in a remarkably simple fashion where the initial energy level be denote by n and the final level be denote by p. for visible wavelength emission there be p=2 and n=3 4 and 5. hence there should be 3 visible wavelength the measure value of the 𝑅 ∞ be 10 973 721.6 𝑚 −1 it be also give by equation 2.2 where 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light in a vacuum and h be plank 's constant finally 𝛼 be the fine structure constant give by 2.3 𝑒 2 4𝜋ħ𝜀 0 2.3 calculate the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer a. spectrometer setup prior to any measurement take it be vital to calibrate the spectrometer so that the measurement we take be accurate the follow procedure align and focus the instrument it be key to note that once one part of a calibration be complete it be n't change during the experiment a it could have effect measurement take 1. we focus the eyepiece on the cross wire by turn the eyepiece it be preferable to have the crosshairs a an x than a '+ 2. we then go to a window and focus the camera lens on a distant object to by twist the camera 3. then we align the collimator and camera and turn on a sodium lamp this be use in place of hydrogen lamp a the hydrogen lamp overheats and can only be on for 15 minute at a time turn the slit to it narrow set to reduce our error then we align the middle of the cross hair to the center of the sodium beam 4. we note the reading on the vernier scale at that point remember that the large reading be in degree and the small one be in arcminute 5. then we move the camera through 90 degree towards ourselves when we do this we make sure the other part of the spectrometer be lock in place and we rotate the vernier scale 45 degree in the opposite direction so that it would end up in the same place after the camera be move and not underneath the collimator hence we could still read it and take a measurement 6. we then place a mirror in the slot until we could see a reflect beam exactly in the middle of the crosshairs meaning that the camera be at exactly 90 degree to the collimator 7. we again note the vernier scale reading we subtract 90 degree from this reading and move the camera back around so that it be at precisely 0 degree to the normal hence make it perfectly align 8. the final step be to replace the mirror with the grate our image be level they do not change height in the horizontal plane and hence no far adjustment be need then we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp align the crosshairs with the central maximum of the lamp we chose the 300 line per mm a we have a stiff camera the 300 line per mm grate a oppose to the 80 would give few maximum but have them more spread out hence there be less chance of u slide past one without notice which would have make our data inaccurate however the down side be that there be few maximum to measure and hence the uncertainty in the wavelength we calculate be great moreover the slit be a narrow a possible so the width of each maximum be small reduce the uncertainty in the position of the maximum a each measurement would have an uncertainty which be half of the width of the beam finally use the eyepiece we observe the position a 𝜃 minus the angle at the central maximum on the vernier scale for each of the three wavelength purple blue and red each have a minimum of 4 measurable maximum with red have an extra 2 and blue have an extra 1. the first calculation be to find the wavelength of each of the emission line by plot 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 𝜆 which would give a straight line graph with a gradient of show the calculate wavelength and their uncertainty the error in the gradient be calculate use the standard error of the repeat we take for each wavelength and compute in python use a covariance matrix the error in the wavelength be due to the difficulty in locate where the center of each maximum be a the error be half of the width of the beam this be minimize by have the slit at it narrow set find the constant itself be a simple calculation use equation 2. this be within 0.28 of the expect value of 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 and have a very small error suggest our experimental procedure be accurate perhaps use the 80 line per mm grate would have yield a small error in the wavelength a there be more maximum to measure however due to the limitation of our stiff camera we could not do this however if we be to repeat the experiment we would choose a well spectrometer and make this adjustment perhaps get a value closer to the know one the aim of this experiment be to verify the remarkable relationship between photon emission and electron transition in hydrogen atom through the use of spectroscopy the experiment be indeed successful and the value we found be with 0.28 of the know value this be testament to the remarkably low error in spectrometer measurement and our own conscious effort to minimize error perhaps the only flaw be that we sacrifice have more maximum to measure by use the 300 line per mm grate a oppose to the 80 line per mm due to the limitation of our equipment if we be to repeat the experiment we would use a well function spectrometer and use the 80 line per mm grate to reduce the uncertainty in our value of wavelength perhaps a more technical extension would be to use apparatus which could detect the paschen and lyman emission series the lyman series emits ultraviolet photon a n=1 and the paschen series emits infrared radiation a n=3 then there would be 9 measurable wavelength of light and reduce the standard error 𝜎 √𝑛 a n would be nine hence the value would be even more accurate,superficial,bal

the sun contains element of sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen first propose by the greek a the fundamental constituent of nature the theory of atomism proposes that all matter be compose of indivisible and indestructible object know a atom with the advent of scientific model and experimental verification the atom be discover to contain orbit electron several model emerge within the 20th century to explain how electron be arrange around atom within ten year there come the cubical model 1902 1 the plumpudding model 1904 2 the saturnian model 1904 rutherford model 1911 and finally the rutherford-bohr model 1911 3 each succeed model improve on it predecessor by eliminate superfluous feature which do not agree with experimental result the success of bohr 's model lie in it ability to account for simple scenario such a a hydrogen atom and a constant which a of yet have no physical explanation the rydberg 's constant the primary aim of this experiment be to examine the balmer series emerge from a hydrogen lamp and thereby verify the rydberg constant r ∞ where λ be the wavelength of emit light and energy level n 3 4 5 .... the secondary aim of the experiment be to test the resolve power of the grate spectrometer a well a to determine the chemical composition of the sun through examine the fraunhofer line and spectral line of certain salt in modern physic bohr 's model be supersede by the schrodinger equation which describes the orbit of electron around an atom in a purely mathematical formulation in 1885 johann balmer discover that an empirical equation could be use to account for the balmer series in a hydrogen atom his equation become know a the balmer equation which describes all the spectral line when electron from a high energy level drop down to the second energy level n 2 where b be a constant with the value of 364.50682nm and n be an integer great than 2. the four possible emission line in the balmer series be name h-alpha h-beta h-gamma and h-delta a show in figure 1 from right to left figure 1 the standard emission spectrum on a balmer series name use greek alphabet start from the right 4 the equation be however purely localize to the principal quantum number of 2. it do not account for the lyman paschen brackett pfund humphreys and far series these series be later generalize by rydberg and explain by bohr 's model a see in figure 2. in 1888 johannes rydberg generalize the balmer equation for all transition of hydrogen 5 use four fundamental equation the four equation be where e be total energy ke kinetic energy and ep e electric potential energy of the electron collectively where f c be the centripetal force act on the electron in orbit due to the nucleus and f e be the electrical force act on the electron due to coulomb 's law where l be the angular momentum i the moment of inertia ω the angular frequency of the electron collectively and h planck 's constant a the electron can only occupy discrete energy state where c be the speed of light and e i and e f indicate the initial and final energy state of the electron respectively the derivation be a follow from equation 3a and common notion ke 1 2 mv 2 and ep e kze 2 r it can be show that where m be the mass of electron v the velocity of electron k coulomb 's constant z the atomic number e the charge of an electron and r the bohr radius distance between electron in the ground state and nucleus in a hydrogen atom from equation 3b and the common notion of circular motion and coulomb 's law it be obtain which reduces to the substitution of equation 6 into equation 4 be make from equation 3c and the common notion of i mr 2 and ω v r it be obtain the subject of the equation be then change to be v yield from here equation 9 be substitute into equation 6 yield which simplifies with r the subject into 11 equation 11 be then substitute into equation 7 yield finally equation 12 be substitute into equation 3d yield note the similarity to equation 1 which be when from here the theoretical value of the rydberg constant can be calculate with know value of h e k m 6 give r ∞ 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 which be similar to the literature value of 10973731.6m −1 give in the first year lab manual 7 grate spectrometer resolution with reference to figure 3 the phase difference ∆φ due to the grate that form a constructive interference be give by where d be the slit separation θ the angle from the zeroth order maximum and m the order of the maximum equation 14 then reduces to the minimum be give by which change to when there be contribution from n slit when there be two similar wavelength incident on the diffraction grate the intensity of the resultant emission spectrum form by the two wavelength will have peak very close to each other a show in figure 4. figure 4 the resultant emission spectrum form from light of two similar wavelength note the difference between ∆λ and ∆l which be difference in wavelength and resolve power respectively 7 if the difference in wavelength ∆λ be great than the resolve power ∆l of the grate a doublet would be see if ∆λ be small than ∆l than the grate spectrometer would fail to resolve the two peak for the purpose of the follow derivation it can be assume that resolve power ∆l equal difference in wavelength ∆λ light from the second wavelength be give by λ 2 λ 1 − ∆λ equation 14 and equation 17 be combine use λ 2 yield which reduces to equation 15 and equation 19 be then combine under λ λ 1 to form which together with definition λ 1 − λ 2 ∆λ yield from equation 21 it can be see that a the number of slit n on the grate decrease the resolution ∆λ increase hence the number of slit n remain at the point when the doublet disappears give the resolution ∆l and wavelength difference between the two light ∆λ classify a a g-type main-sequence star the sun be know to contain an abundance of hydrogen and helium 8 in the center where nuclear fusion occurs white light be produce and certain spectral be absorbed by chemical element present in the atmosphere of the sun figure 5 show the fraunhofer line associate with the sun by burning certain elemental salt in a candle flame and examine the light produce the composition of the sun can be analyse if an element produce the emission spectral line which match an absorption spectral line see in the fraunhofer line it can be conclude the sun contains say element for the purpose of this experiment it can be see that the atmosphere of the sun contains sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen the experimental set-up be divide into two phase calibration and data collection with reference to figure 6 the eyepiece crosswire camera lens be brought into focus on a distant object the telescope and collimator be then brought into alignment and the hydrogen lamp use a the source the focus of the spectrometer be then adjust until a sharp image of the zeroth order spectral line be visible next the telescope be move clockwise by 90 degree and a 78.8 line per mm grate place in the holder the grate table be turn and the height of the table adjust until the slit be again visible the grate be then rotate to be in alignment with the telescope and collimator thus conclude the calibration phase of the experiment for the rydberg constant experiment the order of the spectral line along with it colour be tabulate a a function of the reading on the vernier scale for the spectrometer resolution experiment a sodium lamp be place at the source and the telescope be direct at the small order where a doublet can be see a black piece of cardboard be slide from left to right between the grate and the object slowly until the doublet disappears at this point the ratio of the length of the grate cover up and the total length be estimate by eye for the fraunhofer line experiment a total of four salt be provide sodium chloride iron fill copper sulfate and magnesium oxide a candle be lit use a bunsen burner and the grate spectrometer point at the candle a ladle of the chosen salt be add into the flame and the color of the emission spectrum record and checked use the fraunhofer line show in figure 5. first it be note that all four spectral line h-alpha h-beta h-gamma and h-delta be see in the emission spectrum this be show in figure 7. the order of the balmer series a a function of the vernier scale reading be tabulate in table 1. set the zeroth order a the 0 degree a graph of sinθ against m for the red spectral line and blue spectral line be plot this be show in figure 8 and 9. from equation 15 it could be see that λ d slope since d 1 n 1 78.8mm 7 the value of λ could be derive from the slope of figure 8 and 9. this value of λ be then fed into equation 1 with the appropriate integer value of n 3 4 5 give an average value of r ∞ 10729936.11m −1 compare this with the establish literature value the relative difference be found to be small than 10 and therefore reliable the grate spectrometer resolution it be estimate that half of the total length of the slit be cover when the doublet disappear hence use equation 21 it be found that ∆λ 0.205nm where m 2 λ 2 589 × 10 −9 n 1 2 × 36mm × 80 line per mm the theoretical value for ∆λ be calculate from the follow ∆λ 589.6 − 589.0 0.6nm 24 although the experimental value be in the same order of magnitude a the theoretical value the relative difference be which be great than 10 and not reliable out of the four salt test iron filing and copper sulfate do not produce an emission spectrum sodium chloride produce yellow spectral line in correspondence to fraunhofer designation d and magnesium oxide produce red spectral line in correspondence to fraunhofer designation a a see in figure 5. qualitatively the experiment successfully capture the four spectral line h-alpha h-beta h-gamma and hdelta in the balmer series quantitatively the experiment determine the rydberg constant to a relative difference with the establish literature of 2 since the relative difference be small than 10 the experiment be consider consistent with theory these result be significant a they verify the emission spectral line associate with hydrogen which be commonly found in ionize interstellar hydrogen know a h ii region in astrophysics a nasa photograph of the orion nebula confirms this observation a show in figure 10. although the experimental value for resolution be determine to the same order of magnitude a the theoretical value the relative difference be large than 10 and hence be consider unreliable this inaccuracy of result could be due to an oversimplification in theory which do not account for how the spectrometer and it lens could contribute to an overall resolution this observation be back up by two fact firstly the theory predict that the pair of doublet in sodium lamp should merge into one when in fact one of the doublet simply disappear secondly both doublet disappear together when the source be a hydrogen lamp which should not happen accord to the theory this meant a more sophisticated theory accounting for the spectrometer 's contribution in resolution along with an increase care take during experiment would be necessary for future improvement figure 10 an astronomical photo of the orion nebula with easily identifiable h-alpha and h-delta spectral region locate in the center with h-beta and h-gamma region locate in the fringe 11 fraunhofer line refer to the fraunhofer line see in figure 5 it could be postulate that the solar composition contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen take an abridge table from a paper publish by the araa annual review of astronomy and astrophysics a see in figure 11 it could be see that the postulate be in fact correct figure 11 a breakdown of solar atmosphere composition show that the sun do contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen 12 iron filing do not produce a temperature a it melt point 1500 • c be great than the temperature of the candle 1400 • c although copper sulfate may have produce a green emission spectrum it be unclear whether if the result be due to a contamination of the candle flame hence the experimenter decide to err on the side of caution and discard the result for copper sulfate overall the experiment be consider consistent with theoretical prediction since the four spectral line predict by the theory be observe and rydberg constant be determine to a relative difference of 2 the result be consistent with theory for grate spectrometer resolution the discrepancy between the experimental resolution and theoretical resolution be too large 66 10 and hence a more careful treatment theoretically and experimentally would be warrant for fraunhofer line the result be consistent with the theory of araa which demonstrate that the sun 's atmosphere contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen hence the primary aim of the experiment be attain whilst the secondary aim obtain mixed success,deep,exp
95,GS_KGR276_Redacted,the rydberg constant allows one to predict how the atomic spectrum of various element should behave and the aim of this first year laboratory experiment be to calculate a value for the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer to take measurement on the diffraction pattern from a hydrogen gas lamp the first few transition wavelength for hydrogen 's balmer series be calculate to within ±0.6 of currently accepted high precision measurement 1 these transition wavelength be then use in conjunction with rydberg/bohr 's formula to calculate the rydberg constant a 1.094 ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 this demonstrates the high level of accuracy and precision that can be achieve use spectroscopy the rydberg constant express in shorthand a r ∞ be a constant use most notably in rydberg/bohr 's relation that accurately predicts the transition wavelength for hydrogen the aim of this first year laboratory experiment be to use a grate spectrometer to measure the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy the rydberg constant first arose in johannes rydberg 's pioneer work on the hydrogen spectrum but with no explanation for the physic behind what be be observe later in bohr 's model for the hydrogen atom a physical explanation be provide to derive the same relation which accurately model the energy transition between orbital level 2 spectrometer be important instrument use in the study of light spectrum from various source and be use extensively in multiple field across physic for example in astrophysics where a great deal of the research on the chemical composition of the universe utilizes spectrometer by use a spectrometer to measure the transition wavelength emit by a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp bohr's/rydberg 's model for the hydrogen transition wavelength can be use to deduce the rydberg constant since the spectrometer be capable of very accurate measurement it should be possible to achieve a value for r ∞ within 1 of the currently accepted value of 10 973 731.568 508 ± 0.000 065 m -1 3 bohr 's model hypothesize that the energy level in a hydrogen atom correspond to stable orbit that the electron can take around the nucleus and that the electron can only exist in one of these discrete orbit bohr argue that the angular momentum of the orbit electron be quantize and use classical mechanic mixed with the idea of quantize angular momentum he derive the follow equation that describes the total energy of the electron in the n th permit energy level/orbit where e n be the total energy in the n th orbit m be the electron mass e be the electron charge and h be planck 's constant by equate the difference between 2 energy level to the energy of a photon it can be show that the transition wavelength for hydrogen be give by where n be the initial energy level of the electron p be the final energy level λ be the transition wavelength and r ∞ be the rydberg constant which bohr have show can be express in term of more fundamental physic constant a r ∞ 𝑚𝑒 4 8 ∈ 0 2 ℎ 3 𝑐 3 these transition wavelength correspond to the wavelength of photon that be emit when electron drop down from the n th energy level to the p th energy level the 4 transition wavelength in the visible light spectrum belong to the balmer series 2 which be make up of the transition wavelength from n ≥ 3 and p 2. use a grate spectrometer it be possible to examine these spectral line and to calculate the transition wavelength from which r ∞ can be calculate use 2 calculate the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer a show in fig 1 collimate light ray arrive at the diffraction grate and be diffract by various angle θ produce an interference pattern the path difference between neighbor ray diffract by the same angle θ be dsin θ a highlight in fig 2. the correspond phase difference due to this path difference can be found by multiply the path difference by the magnitude of the wavevector where ∆φ be the phase difference d be the slit separation θ be the diffraction angle and λ be the wavelength of the light be diffract since constructive interference occurs when the phase difference be an integer multiple of 2π this give the follow relation describe the angle that the m th order maximum in the interference pattern will occur 5 where m be the order number from this relation the transition wavelength of hydrogen can be calculate by measure the diffraction angle over various order for each transition wavelength from here r ∞ can be calculate use these value for the hydrogen transition wavelength in order to prepare the spectrometer for take measurement the schematic show in fig 1 be first setup with the grate put to one side temporarily the grate and telescope be both mount separately such that the vernier scale on the spectrometer could be use to observe rotation of both the grate and of the telescope the vernier scale have increment of arcminute before take measurement there be a series of step take to ensure that the instrument be align and focus the eyepiece be focus on the crosshair and the camera lens be focus on a distant object such a the edge of a door that be approximately 15m awaythis be do to focus the camera a far away a possible since the light ray come from the grate be collimate the eyepiece be approach from various different angle and adjust accordingly to ensure that parallax between the image and crosshair be negligible the telescope be then align with the axis of the collimator and the slit width and collimator adjust such that a clear image of the slit be focus on the eyepiece use the clamp and the vernier scale the telescope be carefully rotate by 90.0 ± 0.1° and a diffraction grate of 2001 lines/inch be insert into the holder the grate be slowly rotate until the reflect image of the slit could be see in the eyepiece which indicate that the grate be now at 45° to the incident light ray the grate be then rotate back 45 ± 0.1° and lock into place such that it be accurately set at an angle normal to the incident light ray this be important since relation 5 assumes that the light ray be diffract approach the grate at normal incidence take these step ensure that the theory represent the physical scenario a accurately a possible since the grate ruling be not parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope the image form lay above the crosshair on the eyepiece the grate screw be adjust such that the image form on the eyepiece be in the middle of the crosshair and it be checked that the image form at large angle also form on the center of the crosshair once these step be conclude the spectrometer be set up such that the light ray from the hydrogen gas lamp would be collimate hit the diffraction grate at normal incidence and then focus onto the crosshair inside the telescope for view through the eyepiece in order to get a clear an image a possible of the balmer series spectral line the main light be switch off and desk lamp dim and the door be close such that the room be a dark a possible in the give condition despite this it be only possible to get a clear image of the balmer line correspond to n 3 4 5 a show in fig 3. initially the telescope be focus on the central order 0 maximum which occur at the same location for all wavelength and this angle be record a a reference point give that each maximum have a finite width there be a random error associate with each measurement due to the fact that the crosshair be not necessarily focus exactly at the center of each maximum which be estimate to be ± 0.2° this value be obtain by examine how reproducible the measurement be for give spectral line and note that it be possible to reproduce measurement to this degree of certainty to reduce this source of random error 5 measurement be take for every angle measurement such that a mean and standard error on the mean could be obtain the maximum for each transition wavelength be then measure at various order either side of the central maximum range from order m -5 to m 5. for each set of measurement for θ the mean value and standard error on the mean be calculate use the relation 𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 𝑐𝑜 𝑠 𝜃𝑑𝜃 6 the error on the mean value for θ be translate into the correspond error on sin θ for each transition wavelength the value of θ be use to plot sin θ against m see fig 4. in fig 4 a predict use 5 the data for each transition wavelength yield a linear relationship between sin θ and the order of maximum use a least square linear fitting a compute value for the gradient of each linear fit be obtain with the gradient correspond to λ/d from 5 use a covariance matrix which take into account the error on each individual data point it be possible to also obtain an error on the output gradient from here the value of the gradient and associate error be use to compute value for each transition wavelengthsee table 1. the value for slit separation be obtain from the grate period give on the diffraction grate the grate period be 2001 lines/inch and a small estimate uncertainty of ± 5 lines/inch be add to take into account any discrepancy between the quote period and the actual period this give u a value for the slit separation of 12.69 ± 0.01μm the fractional error for the slit separation and the gradient value be add in quadrature to obtain an error for the value of each wavelength the least accurate measurement be for the n=5 transition wavelength which have an error of 0.6 in comparison to recent high precision measurement for these wavelength 1 in order to calculate r ∞ fig 5 be plot use these compute value for the transition wavelength and their associate uncertainty a show in fig 5 the data follow a linear relationship with the gradient correspond to r ∞ a be expect from 2 from a least square linear fitting that be use a value for the gradient and thus r ∞ output be calculate of 1.094 ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 with a discrepancy of 0.3 between the calculate value for r ∞ and the currently accepted value 3 there be a high level of accuracy on the calculate value for r ∞ however the final uncertainty for the value for r ∞ come out at ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 which be equal to ± 0.64 the main contribute factor to this value for the uncertainty be the finite width of each maximum observe despite appear to the human eye at the center of the crosshair each time a measurement be make the reading on the vernier scale would still vary by ± 0.2° it be attempt to reduce the effect of this random error by take 5 measurement for each maximum however this be still a relatively small sample size be the experiment to be attempt again take a large sample size for each maximum such a 20 measurement would reduce the effect of the random error and would also reduce the standard error on the mean for each value give a small uncertainty on r ∞ fig 4. sin θ plot a a function of order of maximum θ be the angle at which the m th maximum occurs mean value plot for sin θ with the overlaid linear fit be obtain use a least square linear regression error bar calculate use 6 currently accepted value have be obtain from 1 a paper present data on the spectral line from hydrogen obtain use high precision laser spectroscopy another way to reduce the uncertainty and obtain a more accurate value would be to observe more hydrogen transition wavelength the linear fitting show in fig 5 only have three data point which corresponds to a large uncertainty on the output gradient use a more powerful hydrogen gas discharge tube that produce a more intense beam and by eliminate the small source of background light such a desk lamp it should be possible to observe the n=6 hydrogen transition wavelength which do lie within the visible spectrum a 410.2 nm 1 with more data point to consider the linear fitting would output a more accurate value for r ∞ a well a a small uncertainty a key factor that affected the accuracy of the final value of r ∞ be the value for slit separation use the grate use have a period of 2001 lines/inch with an estimate error of ± 5 lines/inch since the slit separation be a constant that be directly use to obtain the wavelength value and their error a repeat of the experiment could involve an investigation into the accuracy and uncertainty of this value since this could yield more accurate value for each transition wavelength and thus a more accurate value for r ∞ lastly source of random error such a background source of light in the spectroscopy room and random error due to the finite thickness of each maximum reduce the accuracy of the final result have a more powerful telescope on the spectrometer couple with a more powerful hydrogen gas lamp would allow the slit width to be reduce whilst still be able to resolve the spectral line this would reduce the random error due to the finite thickness of each spectral line and this also could make it possible to resolve the n=6 transition wavelength which would increase the accuracy on the value for r ∞ the main aim of the experiment be to accurately measure the first few wavelength of the hydrogen balmer series and use these to calculate r ∞ and a correspond uncertainty use a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp angle at which maximum of intensity occur for the n 3 4 5 transition wavelength be measure and knowledge about diffraction and interference pattern be use to calculate the correspond transition wavelength of light it be then possible to verify the relationship that bohr and rydberg have both postulate between the transition wavelength and the correspond difference in energy level relation 2 accurately described the data that be observe with the predict relationship clearly be observe in fig 5. a value for r ∞ be obtain of 1.094 ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 that lay within 0.3 of the currently accepted value which be a key success another key success be that through the careful track of uncertainty and their propagation throughout the calculation a realistic degree of uncertainty be achieve for each wavelength with the currently accepted value for each wavelength a show in table 1 fall within the bound of the quote uncertainty to improve the experiment it be conclude that have total control the environment that the experiment be carry out in would be beneficial such that all source of background light could be eradicate with that achieve there could be a chance of resolve the n=6 transition wavelength which would increase the quality of the linear fitting in fig 5 and thus lead to a more accurate value for r ∞ with a small uncertainty also with more time available large sample size for each data point would help to reduce the impact of the random error that occurs since the standard error on the mean reduces by a rate 1/√n n be the number of measurement take it be also conclude that the accuracy on the value for the transition wavelength and thus r ∞ will always be limited by the accuracy of the grate period so a repeat of the experiment should also include an investigation into the accuracy of the specify grate period such that a more accurate value for the slit separation and it 's uncertainty can be obtain the laboratory session serve a a demonstration of the level of accuracy that can be achieve by a spectrometer and by take a sample of measurement with careful consideration of uncertainty and error it be possible to achieve measurement of nanometer level precision use such an instrument,superficial,bal

michelson interferometer have form an integral part of many scientific discovery and discipline include special relativity spectroscopy and interferometry 1 the simple set up allows for record of the interference of electromagnetic wave a single light source be input and the beam split use a beamsplitter this be follow by beam recombination with the use of two mirror at the detector the movement of one of the two mirror adjusts the path difference between the two light beam this creates interference pattern from which conclusion can be drawn about the source and it constituent frequency a

specification describe a dielectric anti-reflective coat apply face with a great transmission tolerance to wavelength in the 400 -700 nm range the dielectric coat cause a phase change for one beam lead to destructive interference at zero path difference and constructive interference when λ 2 6 the silicon pin photodiode dectector use have a detection range of 400 -1100nm 7 light source be mount on a v-clamp depend on the intensity of the light source plano-convex lens of focal length 24.5 and 100.0mm be insert between source and beamsplitter to widen beam and between beamsplitter and detector to refocus the alignment of the interferometer be checked and adjust use green laser light point beam be project onto a screen place in front of the detector and the kinematic mirror move until fizeau fringe be see a magnify lens be then insert and the motorize mirror adjust until a minimum of haidinger fringe be see a white light source be then insert and an interferogram take the peak of this interferogram be indicative of a null point at the position −0.6663 ± 0.0005mm and all subsequent data be take in a 100µm range about this point the velocity of the motorize mirror be set to 0.5µms −1 theoretical calculation use the nyquist theorem 4 of the minimum speed imply a much great speed may be use however a the oscillation record by the interferogram do not form perfect sine wave many more than two data point per oscillation be necessary to ensure complete information the velocity of the mirror be also slow to reduce beating between frequency present beating be a result of the superposition of the two interference pattern this beating form an envelop function that corrupt the data follow collection of data interferograms be plot and gaussian fit overlaid the coherence length be deduce to be roughly equal to the full width half maximum of the gaussian curve and from this spectral width calculate where appropriate mean wavelength be found use a similar gaussian-overlay method on the fourier transform and estimate the mean value in case where this be not possible a value be estimate use visual approximation fourier transform spectroscopy approximates light source a point source in many case this be a good approximation however it would be beneficial to insert a small aperture between the source and the beamsplitter fig 2 show an example interferogram table 1 show key result relate to property of light source error be usually calculate through visual estimation of goodness of fit where wavelength be a single value this be the mean wavelength take at peak spectral intensity and error be the standard deviation approximate through a gaussian fit for the blue lead it be possible to computationally fit a gaussian function this produce a covarence matrix from which error parameter be found where wavelength be a range of value this be the range over which there be high spectral intensity error on the coherence length of the white lead be high due to the presence of a secondary gaussian envelope function on the interferogram error on the coherence length of unfiltered tungsten be high due minimal peak in the secondary gaussian lead to highly subjective fitting of the gaussian overlay the coherence length for the mercury lamp be not present due to excessive noise in data no data be take for unfiltered mercury this would be beneficial a a comparative tool the range of wavelength detect whilst use green and yellow filter on the tungsten and mercury lamp be surpasses what be expect for the respective light range despite this clear cut off frequency be demonstrate by the sharp depreciation in spectral intensity at the edge of the allow range a show in fig 4. far discussion on filter be in present in section 4b the white lead exhibit two peak of wavelength a show in fig 3 with wavelength document in table 1. this be indicative of the lead be make up of a monochromatic light source and fluorescent phosphorous coat the agreement of wavelength within range of error of the blue peak of the white lead and the blue lead imply similar source be use when look at the white lead the light emit be obviously non-uniform imply vary thickness in the phosphorus coat a ground glass diffuser be add between the source and beamsplitter in an attempt to minimize this inconsistency and blend frequency despite this when compare interferograms of the light with and without the diffuser no significant change be see it would be beneficial to reduce the aperture of the incident white light use a pin hole to ensure uniformity the coherence length of colour source be see to be large than for white light in most case this be due to the extensive superposition of multiple wave of different frequency a show by large spectral width for white light source many frequency be superimpose to contribute to the final pulse on the interferogram a the number of contribute frequency to a source tends to infinity the resultant pulse of intensity in the time domain narrow the tungsten lamp produce a black body emission spectrum partially show in fig 5 with a peak at 845 ± 10nm use wien 's displacement law where t be absolute temperature of the source the temperature of the tungsten lamp be found to be 3420 ± 40k this value be outside the range expect 2500 -3300 k however it be important to note that the nature of emission of a blackbody mean wavelength deep into the infrared will be emit and will give rise to intensity peak outside of the detector 's sensitivity so this peak in intensity in the visible zone should be treat with some skepticism 8 the majority of discharge of a mercury lamp be in the ultraviolet zone 10 and thus not picked up by the detector this be due to the de-excitation of electron from quantize energy level cause highly energetic photon emission emission in the visible zone be weak and thus highly susceptible to noise when record this be demonstrate by fig 4a data take for mercury be include however should be treat with caution for this reason the expect presence of a doublet under the cut of frequency be demonstrate by sharp decrease in spectral intensity however be different to those expect from manufacturer specification 9 yellow filter be not distinguishable a more sensitive detector be necessary for accurate analysis of mercury emission for low input velocity of the motorize mirror the motion of the mirror be not constant a the input velocity use be 0.5µs −1 the expect positional change between sample be 0.001µm through analysis of a data set of 43422 measurement the mean positional deviation be found to be 1.02 ± 0.64 × 10 −2 µm the error on this result be the standard deviation in addition to this large standard deviation the stage do not move between reading in 4.46 of case this lack of movement demonstrates the lack of suitability of the motorize mirror extensive analysis of light source the inconsistent motion of the mirror may have result in false peak of spectral intensity the beamsplitter use be coat in an anti-reflection coat state to transmit between 40 and 55 of incident light in the wavelength range 400-700nm below this range percentage transmission decay exponentially however above there be a gradual roughly linear decrease the lack of equality between reflection and transmission of wave will effect interference pattern the resultant effect in the fourier transforms have be ignore however quantify resultant error would be beneficial the spectral sensitivity s of the detector be a function of wavelength this lead to a skewed weight and bias towards longer wavelength in the final wavelength fourier transforms of the interferograms through manual fitting of the manufacturer publish graph of spectral sensitivity against wavelength 7 it be possible to approximate the function to where f w be an inverse quadratic function of wavelength w the technique use to fit the curve be estimate through visual analysis to have an error of ±5 by multiply the fourier transform wavelength spectrum by this function intensity be alter to demonstrate 'true experimental situation this be demonstrate in fig 3 where fig 3a be the spectral intensity prior to correction and fig 3b be the spectral intensity after the large range of wavelength show in fig 4 for both the mercury and tungsten lamp be not wholly indicative of the presence of a yellow filter the filter use be thorlab uv/vis bandpass laser line filter the manufacturer specification state a tolerance of 500 − 590 ± 2nm for yellow light the rejection of wavelength outside this range be state to be 99.9 the state lifetime of the filter be two year due to break down of a component dielectric 9 far information be require on the age of the filter to determine the extent this contributes to error in result v. conclusion a michelson interferometer have be create use standard laboratory equipment various light source have be analyze and equipment suitability ass for this line of investigation whilst high quality interferograms have be create and use to find wavelength coherence length and spectral width of light high error be present limitation in various apparatus affect result and reduce precision the filter use have a great tolerance than expect and the motorize mirror have inconstant motion for the mercury lamp weak emission

97,2ndINT_GYI981_Redacted,in this experiment a series of light spectl 3 from various light source be produce with use of a mic.helson intel'feromete1• the light source use we1•e a white lead blue lead and a 2796k tungsten lamp additionally green and yellow filtel 's we1•e use in conjunction with the tungsten lamp to obse1-ve the effect they have on the tungsten spectrum these spectrum be described quantitatively by several value wavelength coherence length and spectral width with use of these value in addition to the genel'31 shape of the spectrum the light source can be characterise and compa1•ed to the theory all spectl 3 produce we1•e of the same shape a their theoretical counterpart and most disc1•epandes could be account for by the 1•esponse function of the detector use the white lead have the b1•oadest spectl•al width of 137.9nm and thus also the large coherence length whic.h be a expect a white light contains all frequency of light the colour light source have narrower spectl•a and the light filter be show to shift and narrow the specn•a in accordance with their expect bandpass region t he aim of this experiment be to measure and characterise light spectrum from various light source through find their mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width and see if these result coincide with the theory the physical aim be to construct and operate a michelson interferometer in order to record interferograms of various light source these interferograms can then be use to obtain the various spectrum of the light source a far goal be to explore how different light filter would affect the light spectnun produce to do this a simple michelson interferometer be built and by emit the light source onto the interferometer and measure the light intensity over a few millimetre in distance an interferogram be produce to produce the spectrum the interferogram be fourier transform and then through fitting a gaussian the characteristic value previously mention can be calculate the michelson interferometer be a collllllon configuration for an optical interferometer and have many u from study the atmosphere measure the diameter of star test optical component and be even use in the detection of gravitational wave pl it relies on the use of a beam splitter which split the incident light from the source into two separate beam and down different path these beam be then reflect and re combine accord to the superposition principal at the beam splitter and an interference pattem be measure at the detector the superposition principle be a fundamental and very important idea with many application in physic and engineering though principle such a this be very well understood and have be for a long period of time it be always important to revisit these idea a it help develop our understand of them interferometry and optic will always be relevant and essential area of physic -not only be the fundamental of these branch apply in everyday life such a in photography and medicine but they be also crucial in the study of quantum mechanic astronomy and more this experiment relies on the use of a michelson interferometer the basis of this interferometer be that the light from the source be emit onto a beam splitter in this case a half-silvered mirrnr which can send the light dm v11 two possible path one of the beam will be reflect by 90 degree and one will be transmit a see in figure 1 below it be important to note that when light hit the beam-splitter and be reflect on the side of the dielectric plate the light will undergo a phase shift of n radian the reflect beam travel along arm a to the first rnirtor m 1 and be reflect back towards the beam splitter likewise the transmit beam travel along aim b to the mirror m2 the two wave then recombine once they reach the beam splitter where their amplitude will combine in accordance with the superposition prir1ciple some of this light will be transmit in the dire ction of the source and some will travel towards the detector sir1ce the light travel to the detector be a supe1position of two wave an interference pattem will be observe at the detector the nature of which be detennir1ed by the path difference and relative phase of the two wave due to the phase shift that the wave that travel along arm b experience if the path difference of the two wave be zero or integer multiple of wavelength i.e the distance of each min-or from the beam splitter be the same the wave be in fact out of phase and have a phase difference of 7c radian this mean the wave will undergo complete destructive interference and a dark fringe will be see meanwhile if there be a path difference of multiple half wavelength they will ultimately be in phase when they reach the detector and constmctive interference will occur so a bright fringe be see the path difference of the two wave be dependent on the difference in arm length for the two 1nitrnrs figure 2 show a simplify diagram of the michelson interferometer assume the 1nittors be perfectly pe1pendicular when observe from the position of the detector see figure 1 the light simply appear to be reflect from two min-ors in line w ith each other with a distance t between them which be equal to the difference in aim length use simple trigonometiy it be easy to see that the light beam reflect off the second miirnr m2 travel an exti•a distance equal to 2tcos 0 before reach the observer a aforementioned constructive interference occurs at half integer wavelength in a michelson interferometer hence for constmctive ii1terference where a. be the wavelength and m be the order of inte1ference which be an integer there be two type of visible fringe that may be observe haidii1ger and fizeau haidinger frii1ges ai•e cfrculai• whereas fizeau fringe fonn sti•aight line 1 2 1. haidinger frii1ges be produce when the two 1nittors appeai• to be perfectly pai•allel a in figure 2 such that the angle at which the light be incident and reflect from the two 1nittors be the same and hence there be cylii1drical symmetiy this symmetly be disturbed when one of the lllllrnrs be tilt and the fringe pattem tends to fonn more of a stl'aight line pattem to understand the spectrn of different light source it be necessaiy to understand how each light source work in this experiment the light source use be a white lead a blue lead and a white tungsten source ffrstly lead create light by electroluminescence electroluminescence be what occurs when an elect1•ic cun-ent or field be pas through a semiconductor material which then emits light the lead contains two layer of material which have be doped such that one layer have an excess of electi•ons and the second an excess of positive electron hole fonning a p-n junction this junction only allows electron to flow from the positive layer to the negative a the electi•on move into the electi•on hole a photon be release because the energy level of the positive hole be low the difference in energy between the layer be call the bandgap and be specific to each combination of material therefore the frequency of light emit and hence the colour of lead be detennined by the material use in the p-n junction and be only over a short range of wavelength to create a white lead you coat a blue lead with phosphor these phosphor absorb the light and ai•e then reemitted at a different large wavelength of a different colour thus by combii1ing a blue lead with a mixture of different phosphor a combination of different wavelength of light be emit produce white light 1 3 1. the process through which a tungsten lamp emits light be know a incandescence the emission of light be a result of a tungsten filament be heat to high temperature when a c1utent pas through it this be thermal radiation and thus a tungsten lamp can be approximate to a blackbody 1 5 1. a theoretical blackbody spectmm can be found usii1g p lanck s law 2hv 3 1 where b be the spectral radiance density h be planck 's constant v be the frequency of radiation c be the speed of light k the boltzmann constant and t the temperatme of the blackbody 1 6 1. the spectral shape of the emission spectrum from these light source be approximately a gaussian the normal distribution of a gaussian have the fom1 u ... fzii where µ be the mean value and u be the standard deviation so through fitting a gaussian to a spectrnm the mean/central wavelength can be found precisely fwthennore the spectral width be equal to the full width at half maximwn fwhm of the gaussian the fwhm and thus the spectral width can be fou11d from the follow equation 21 the spectral width be a measure of the range of frequency or wavelength emit by the light source use this value in conjunction with the mean wavelength the coherence length l of the source can be found l ~2 x 5 where a. be the mean wavelength and til be the spectral width 8 1. the coherence length be the distance over which a light wave remains a specific degree of coherence when the path difference of interfere wave be within the coherence length the interference pattem be strong beyond this the signal becomes poor an interferogram be a record of the signal across an interference pattem a spectnun of light be just a fourier transfo1m of the interferogram go from the temporal domain to the spectral frequency domain due to the fact the spectmm be a gaussian the interferogram will also be in the f01m of a gaussian 2 1. an important feature of this be that the nairnwer the spectral width of the gaussian the wider the interferogram hence the michelson interferometer can be use a a spectrometer a will be discus more in the method ill. me1hod the interferometer be built in agreement with the set up show in figure 1 specifically with a silicon detector the detector be attach to a computer which sainpled the data at a rate of 50hz the first mitrnr ml be place on a motorise stage so that the interference pattem could be scan over a range of path difference the speed at which the stage move to ai1y position could be specify the interferometer must be almost perfectly align to get the con-ect interference pattems to ensw•e this the two miffors must be at the exact same distance from the beam splitter and all equipment must be level and parallel with the optical bench the two 1nitrors be place at approximately the same distance from the beam splitter to guarantee the distance be exactly equal a monochromatic laser be use this produce two laser spot one from ea.eh miffor which be then reflect onto a surface some distance away such that they be small and in do so increase the precision of the alignment the miffors be adjust tmtil the two spot be dfrectly on top of ea.eh other to ensure that the 1nitrors be parallel a lens be insert so that the interference pattem could be see and the mi1rnr be tilt tmtil haidinger fringe be observe before takit1g any data it be necessary to find the null point the null point of the interferometer be when the aim length a1•e equal so the path difference of the two light wave be zero i.e t=o arou11d the null point the it1te1ference pattem of light will be most prominent this be because the space of tbe frit1ges be proportional to the wavelength of light so the fringe will only coincide near the region where the path difference be zero 9 1. once the null point be fotmd these bright and dark fringe can be record to give an interferogram to find the null point ml be move in very slowly in ve1y small increment and the fringe pattem observe refening to equation one a the null point be approach t decrease and thus the angle of the reflect light get large so fringe appear to move in towards the centre of the cfrcle the null point be at the position where the dfrection of movement of the fringe revers once this position be roughly fow1d the reduce rai1ge be scan over use a white lead source at the null point this will produce a large dark frit1ge but just arow1d it a distit1ctive interference pattem of a few different colour fringe be see a the many wavelength withit1 white light have be sepai•ated to find the exact position it be ne cessaiy to use the white lead interferogram create a simulation of this exact setup it be possible to find the shape of the interferogram arntmd the null point so once this shape of it1terferogram have be fotmd it be conclude that the coitect length have be en scan over and the null point lie it1 the position of the centre of the interferogram once the null poit1t be found it be possible to find light spectrum of various light source from thefr interferograms repeat the scan process that be carry out for the white lead interferograms of a blue lead and white tungsten lamp also obtain the interference pattems be scan over small distance at slow speed such that many data point be take to extract the light spectrum from the interferogram a fast fourier transform fft be pe1fo1med on the data within python this rely upon the fact that there be equal space between each data point in the interferogram once the specflum be found it be possible to fit a gaussian to the transfonned data use an inbuilt function on python which give the standard deviation and the value of the mean wavelength to investigate how light filter affected the light spectrum the same process be can-ied out but with two different filter fit inside the tungsten lamp yellow and green firstly from the interferogram produce from tlte white lead show in figure 7 it be possible to find the null point compare this to the simulated interferogram in figure 6 it be of a similar shape and symmetly just with more fringe the cenfl•e of this graph and hence the position of the null point of the interferometer lie at -2.872±0.0005mm a gaussian be fit to each of the peak in the spectrum the first one centi•ed at 450nm coll'esponds to the light from the blue lead and the second one centre at 585nm coll'esponds to the mixture of wavelength emit from the phosphor compare this to the theoretical spectrum in figure 3 the position of the spectrum be accurate however the relative intensity of the peak be unexpected this however be a direct result of the responsivity of the silicon detector this be it effectiveness at produce an electi•ic signal at different wavelength this varies with each detector but in general be high for large wavelength a show in figure 9 when take this into account the peak at 450nm would in fact be of a high intensity than the one at 585run which would match with the tlteory • 1000 1100 fig 9. typical response function of a silicon detector iioj_ when find the spectral length of the white light only the peak at 585nm be consider since tltis contain a large number of wavelength and be more representative of a white light source the standard deviation of this gaussian be 59run so from 4 the specfl•al width be 137.srun use this in 5 in conjw1ction with tlte mean wavelength the value for the coherence length come out a 0.0039mm -by look a t the distance the interferogram span in figure 7 this value seem quite accurate next the interference of a blue lead be measure a this only contains one colour of light it emits light over a small range of frequency so it be expect that the spectral width of this source will be nall'ower than that of the white lead -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this gaussian fit to this spectrum be centre at 4 7 6run which be within the range of wavelength for blue light the shape of this spectrum match that of the blue lead peak show in figure 3. the standard deviation of the gaussian be equal to 13run and thus the spectra.i width be 30.4nm this be much less than that of the white lead which be consistent witlt the theo1y the coherence lengtlt be found to be 0.0050mm again this be more than that of the white lead and be thus consistent with the tlteory a for a nairnwer spectral width the broader the interferogram produce a mention in the theory section the spectrum for the tungsten lamp be more consistent with that of a blackbody than a gaussian it be immediately clear that this do not give the expect result this can be explain through consideration of the response function show in figure 9 -the responsivity of the detector rapidly cut off around the 1000nm mark which con-esponds to where the spectrum cut off so realistically the spectnun do continue past 1000nm just the detector do not respond to the signal secondly from figure 4 you would expect the spectrum to be more jagged -this could simply be due to the fact that not enough data point be measure so the resolution be not good enough to pick up the rise and fall in the spectrum a a gaussian be not fit to the spectrnm the value for wavelength and coherence length must be read off the above graph the spectrum suggests that the mean wavelength be at approximately 800mn and the width of the interferogram and hence the coherence length be approximately 0.005mm by rean-anging 5 the spectral width come at to be 85mn a light filter be a piece of material which absorbs some frequency of light but allows others to pa through essentially passing through just one specific colour the range of frequency it do transmit be it bandwidth in this experiment a yellow and a green filter be use with the tungsten lamp a show in figure 13 when the green filter be use the tungsten spectmm be spectrum be shift such that it be centre at 555nm which be within the range of green light ~520-560nm furthennore it be much na1tower than the original tungsten spectnun with cj 8nm and the spectral width equal to 18.7mn this be what you would expect a the light pas through the filter with few frequency the coherence length be 0.026mm -a much large coherence length for a much nan-ow spectrnm similarly for the yellow filter the spectnun be shift to 590mn with an equal standard deviation and thus spectral width a the green filter yellow light be within the of ~560-5 90mn so this be what you would expect from the theo1y also since the spectral width of this spectrnm be equal to that of the green filter it can be conclude that the size of the bandwidth of the two filter be the same again this give a large value for the coherence length l=0.029mm i 1 000 the main source of e1tor in this experiment come from the fact the fourier transfo1m require that the distance between each sample be equal when in fact when look at the raw data for the position of the stage this be not the case a lot of the time when transfonning to the spectrnl wavelength domain this could lead to a shift in the position of the spectmm potentially make it wider in some part and na1tower in others this would have an effect on the mean value of the wavelength and the spectral width and thus also the coherence length furthennore potential misalignment of the apparatus throughout the experiment could affect the interference pattern and interferogram record which would also adjust the shape of the spectrum produce a silicon detector typically have a tolerance of around 5 so there be some e1tor in the value show for the intensity however since only the relative intensity be of interest and this will have the same effect on all the sample this do not directly affect the result and can be take into account within the response function the aim of this experiment be to use a michelson interferometer a a fourier transform spectrometer in order to obtain and compare spectrum of different light source the interferometer be successful in obtain fairly accurate spectrum for each source and the characteristic of each spectrum i.e mean wavelength and spectral width varied in agreement with the theory the second aspect of this experiment be to show how light filter change the shape of the light spectrum and how the bandwidth of the filter change the spectral width both the blue and yellow filter create a large decrease in the spectral width of the tungsten spectrum and shift the peak accordingly to the wavelength that align with their colour a an improvement more sample should be take over the distance of the interferogram a this will in turn produce a spectrum of great resolution furthermore a response function of the detector should be make which considers before the responsivity and tolerance of the detector such that the spectrum could be adjust to give a more accurate view of the relative intensity to gain a great understand of the error in the calculation some analysis could be carry out to see how unequal space would affect the fft and consequently the spectral shape,deep,bal
98,2ndINT_MFR246_Redacted,in this experiment we explore the spectral composition of blue lead white lead mercury lamp and tungsten lamp use fourier spectroscopy with a michelson interferometer we analyse the blue lead with no filter white lead mercury lamp and tungsten lamp with no filter green filter and yellow filter for the white lead we found that their frequency profile follow a standard

𝟓𝟒𝟔𝒏𝒎 in all case for white lead tungsten lamp and mercury lamp the green and yellow filter produce data which closely overlap the green light range at 𝟓𝟐𝟎 − 𝟓𝟔𝟎𝒏𝒎 and yellow light range at 𝟓𝟔𝟎 − 𝟓𝟗𝟎𝒏𝒎 the michelson interferometer be a common configuration for optical interferometry invent by albert abraham michelson in the 19 th century 1 it be most well-known for it u by albert michelson and edward morley to test for luminiferous aether in the famous michelson-morley experiment in 1887 the null result of which disprove the existence of such an aether 2 the result later lead eventually to the special theory of relativity and the revolution in physic at the begin of the twentieth century a recent application of the michelson interferometer today be found in gravitational-wave detection the existence of which be predict by general relativity a network of international laser interferometer have be construct in several country to detect these wave include the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ligo in the united state virgo in italy geo600 in germany and kagra in japan all of these experiment consist of a michelson interferometer with kilometer-scale arm length the equipment at ligo be sensitive up to 10 −18 m or nearly one-thousandth the diameter of a proton michelson interferometer can thus perform some of the most sensitive length measurement possible ligo and it partner observatory be vastly more complicate than the interferometer in this kit but the fundamental physical principle behind their operation be michelson interferometry 3 in this laboratory session by use the physical principle of the experimental setup and the mathematics of fourier transform the michelson interferometer can be use a a spectrometer to examine the interference fringe of different light source that be brought under investigation in this experiment first discover by joseph fourier when he be look for a mathematical description of the process of heat conduction a fourier transform be the mathematical language use in formulate the equivalence and symmetry of wave or particle in space and time this be illustrate in the follow two equation and where x be the position the wave-signal 's amplitude be measure at 𝜔 be the angular frequency in the fourier frequency-space in the frequency space the amplitude of the signal show how much of each frequency 𝜔 be present in the wave equation 1 show that the fourier transform of any general wave-signal f x take over in physical space −∞ 𝑥 +∞ yield g 𝜔 it fourier representation in frequency space equation 2 show that if the inverse fourier transform be perform on g 𝜔 the original signal will be produce in this way fourier transforms act a a map between the physical representation of a wave and it fourier frequency representation fourier transforms form the mathematical basis for describe couple variable such a position and momentum energy and time in quantum mechanic 4 in classical physic one of the fundamental tenet be that we would be able to determine the frequency of an electromagnetic signal with complete certainty this certainty manifest itself a an infinitely thin diracdelta function 𝛿 𝜔 in the frequency domain with unity height and unity area centre on the know frequency however this tenet do not hold in quantum mechanic where certainty in one measurement creates uncertainty in another variable a a direct result of heisenberg 's uncertainty principle a show in equation 3 the exact frequency of an electromagnetic signal can not be know with complete certainty at any point in time fourier spectroscopy use the michelson interferometer this implies that for a give frequency measurement will arise a a frequency distribution with a central maximum and a finite spread in the form of a gaussian distribution a oppose to a dirac delta function in this experiment we will tabulate the frequency spread of the measurement a well a the bandwidth with it fwhm full-width at half maximum result the michelson interferometer operate base on the principle that the interference of 2 identical light beam will produce constructive interference or destructive interference depend on their path-difference by keep the distance between beamsplitter with mirror 1 and beamsplitter with mirror 2 the reflect and transmit beam will have a path difference of zero the perfectly perpendicular position of the mirror be to retain the cylindrical symmetry of the setup if the cylindrical symmetry be not broken haidinger fringe could be see at infinity but if it be broken fizeau fringe appear at a short finite distance from mirror 1. by keep the orientation of mirror 2 fix and vary it perpendicular distance from the beamsplitter the path length of the two identical beam can be varied to create a haidinger fringe that evolves over time this evolve pattern be record and use fourier transform it could be use to analyse various characteristic of the source by the principle of superposition destructive interference and hence dark fringe would occur when the path difference be 𝜆 𝑛 1 2 whilst constructive interference and hence light fringe would appear when the path difference be 𝑛𝜆 where 𝑛 be the order of interference and an integer where there be no path-difference or 𝑛 0 the point be know a the null point of the michelson interferometer at the null point we expect to find the high light intensity due to maximum constructive interference from the reflect and transmit beam 5 iii method in the michelson interferometer a laser beam be split by a cube beamsplitter the split beam be then reflect back by mirror and recombine at the beamsplitter a screen at the output of the interferometer show an interference pattern a lens be use to diverge the beam in order to obtain an interference pattern consist of light and dark ring constructive or destructive interference respectively the interferometer be set up use the follow step first mirror 1 be position at the edge of the breadboard use four cap screw then the laser assembly be position on the oppose side of the breadboard the laser be then tipped and tilt so that the reflect beam fall back into the laser aperture after that the base be secure to the breadboard with a cap screw the beamsplitter and the screen be instal ensure that the beam be split at a 90° angle that be achieve by observe the secondary reflection on the screen when they coincide with the primary reflection the beamsplitter be at a 90° angle a slight deviation occur in the vertical direction which do not affect

99,2ndINT_CTW087_Redacted,the purpose of this experiment be to calculate the spectral profile of various light source by use a fourier transform spectrometer they be a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten lamp with a green filter attach each light source be attach to an interferometer comprise of a beam splitter a fix mirror an adjustable mirror and a detector each of the interferograms be fourier transform to find the spectral profile of the light source the principle discussion point be whether the profile reproduce the expect shape base on the physical mechanism which generate the light in each source and the individual wavelength which be present in the source the calculate wavelength for the blue lead be 478.9 nm and for the tungsten lamp with a green filter be 551.2 nm his experiment be carry out in order to calculate the spectral profile of various light source by use a michelson interferometer the interferometer be combine with python script which perform fourier transforms in order to produce spectral profile for each light source the technique implement in this experiment be integral to many aspect of scientific measurement a it allows for very precise measurement on the order of a nanometer a recently a last month interferometry be use to detect a binary neutron star merger 130 million light year away from earth the preference of an interferometer combine with a fourier transform mechanism over a spectrometer be due to the difficulty of create a tool which be able to take measurement at frequency comparable to that of light ≈ 10 14 hz this be the case with the spectrometer however a an interferometer measure interference pattern which only change at the rate specify by the observer it be prefer for high-frequency source the light source which be test where a white lead and blue lead and a tungsten lamp the underlie physical principle of this experiment be wave interference in a michelson interferometer and the emission spectrum of p-n junction and blackbody the configuration of a michelson interferometer be outline below in figure 1. light be emit from a source and divide by the partially silver mirror into two separate beam the two beam be then reflect off of either m1 or m2 the beam then recombine and interfere whether the interference be constructive or destructive be determine by the relative path and phase difference between the two ray thus interference be a very precise way of determine the relative distance between m1 and m2 a convenient way to visualize the beam interfere be by consider the two mirror a be in the same plane and light enter from an extend source this be demonstrate in figure 2. the left-hand figure demonstrates when the two mirror be perpendicular to one another and there be cylindrical symmetry the right-hand figure illustrates a tilt between the mirror and when the symmetry be broken 1 the left-hand figure illustrates when the two mirror be perpendicular to one another and there be cylindrical symmetry in the system when this happens the fringe be calculation of the spectral shape of lead and a tungsten lamp use a fourier transform spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london t concentric ring haidinger fringe when one of the mirror be tilt with respect to the other this symmetry break down and the fringe form straight line fizeau fringe in order to use the interferometer a a spectrometer measurement be take about t 0 refer to a the null point this produce a series of fringe which be detect electronically the interference pattern in fact contains all of the information require to calculate the wavelength profile of the source if a fourier transform be perform on the interference pattern it return a wavelength profile for the source 1 a fourier transform be a mathematical tool which can transform a function from spacial co-ordinate to wavelength co-ordinate hence in a complex wave pattern it be able to extract the individual wavelength of the sinusoid which superpose to form the observe wave the fourier transform return the wavelength and their relative amplitude below be the equation which be use to transform between space and wavelength here 𝑓 𝑥 be the function in spatial coordinate which be transform to return the frequency spectrum 𝑔 𝜔 2 so a monochromatic wave becomes a dirac delta under a transform a a consequence of the fourier transforms the large the width of a wavelength spectrum of a wave be the small the width of the interference pattern the distance over which the pattern be detectable be refer to a the coherence length so a white light source should in principle have a shorter coherence length than a yellow light source this be demonstrate in figure 3. in practice the wavelength spectrum be a direct consequence of the physical mechanism within a light source the emission spectrum of a solid be often well model a black body radiation unlike gas in which atom-atom interaction be negligible and atomic transition produce photon with discrete energy in a solid the atom be close enough so that it affect the energy distribution of photon make it a continuous distribution the perfect blackbody emits and absorbs across all wavelength whilst in practice this can not exist it be a useful idealization for a number of material this be the approximation which be apply to the tungsten lamp a it be a hot dense solid the profile of a black body be show below in figure 4 and it be useful to note that the temperature and peak wavelength be inversely proportional to one another a show in equation 4. λ 𝑃𝑒𝑎𝑘 × t 2.9 × 10 −3 𝑚𝐾 4 where t be temperature and λ 𝑃𝑒𝑎𝑘 be the characteristic wavelength of the spectrum 3 in a light emit diode lead many electron be excite and interact with hole the electron recombine with the hole and release a photon with an energy which be approximately that of the band gap between the valence and conduction band in that material this be well illustrate by the dispersion relation in figure 5 and the p-n diagram in figure 6. figure 5 a simplify 1 dimensional parabolic dispersion relation for a semi-conductor 5 figure 6 a p-n junction diagram which illustrates how hole and electron recombine in the middle region to produce a photon with energy equivalent to that of the band gap in figure 5 5 hence the energy and by extension frequency of photon which be release from the p-n junction be not discrete but should resemble something more akin to a narrow gaussian profile due to the nature of the band gap the experimental setup consist of a michelson interferometer and computer refer to figure 1 for detail the interferometer be connect to a computer which store data and use python to perform fourier transforms the interferometer require calibration before it could be use this meant make sure each of the beam from the source to the mirror be overlap with the other in order to minimise the error which small disturbance to the apparatus could cause the apparatus be built with a small a distance a possible between each of the individual component in order to make the fringe more visible particular lens be use to make the pattern large once locate the desire light source be screw into the apparatus and measurement be record measurement take be relatively straight forward for this experiment the moveable mirror be sent to the start location and scan through the range around the null point which be specify there be slight contention about how many measurement should be take in order to maximize the accuracy of the detection but also not so many that they become unnecessary ultimately it be decide that 30000 reading should be take across a 2 mm range it should also be note that any constant offset in the interferograms be dealt with in the fourier transform a a line near the origin which be neglect the first measurement be make on a white lead the theory predict that the shape of the interference pattern would be a narrow gaussian a white light have a broad frequency spectrum and lead 's have gaussian emission profile below be figure 7 and 8 the interferogram and fourier transform for the white lead indeed there be element of this interferogram which both agree and disagreed with the theory it do have a gaussian profile but be also asymmetric which be not predict by the theory the reason for the asymmetry be clearly displayed in figure 8. the lead be not comprise of a continuous wavelength distribution but two spike a narrow one in the blue region and a broad one in the green/yellow the reason for this unexpected profile can be found in the construction of the lead it be comprise of a uv/blue lead in it centre which be coat in a fluorescent material which absorbs uv/blue radiation and re-emits white light however the limitation of the lead be displayed in the result and it be inefficient at mix light of different wavelength 6 to test the validity of this explanation the measurement be retaken but this time a diffusion lens be attach to the apparatus to aid the mix of the light this be demonstrate in figure 9 and 10. it be not immediately evident from figure 9 that there be any noticeable change in the mix of the wavelength however the wavelength profile provide far more insight into the effect of the lens the peak which represent the blue light be far less intense than before which implies that the light be be mixed more efficiently thus the spectrometer displayed the expect wavelength profile in accordance with the p-n junction theory and the specific composition of the lead however test it ability to calculate specific wavelength be a task well suit to the use of a monochromatic light source the underlie physic of the blue lead be not very different from the white lead but it be a well way to test the spectrometer 's ability to calculate specific wavelength of light yet again a gaussian interference pattern be expect except it should have be slightly broader than the white lead figure 12 the wavelength profile for the blue lead with a peak wavelength of 478.9 nm the measure peak wavelength be 478.9 nm the interferogram be indeed a gaussian shape a predict and broader than the white lead interferogram the fourier transform produce figure 12 which indicates one prominent wavelength of 478.9 nm this be compare to the value give on the lead 's datasheet which be 470 ≤ λ ≤ 475 nm 7 there be two significant reason which for the error in the measure value the first be that the reading for stage distance be inaccurate a the stage do not measure the correct distance this may have introduce a positive or negative shift in the interferogram and the wavelength profile perhaps even more significantly the detector which be use in this experiment have a wavelength dependent sensitivity this be show in figure 13. this profile suggests that blue light be not detect a well a longer wavelength and thus the wavelength which be calculate be shift towards the longer wavelength a potential correction could be a deconvolution with this profile and the calculate fourier transform however the exact sensitivity profile be not accessible and hence this extension be not attempt the final part of the investigation analyse the effect of a filter on a wavelength profile of a tungsten lamp the result display the predict sink function and the wavelength profile be a sharp peak in the green region the exact wavelength be 551.2 nm the wavelength which be give in the datasheet be 543.5 ± 2 nm 9 yet again the reason for this error be due to the detector and the moveable stage however a well a that the tungsten lamp undergoes heating and become less efficient with time this manifest itself a an incline in the interferogram it be positive a the stage be move from the righthand side of the graph to the left hence this introduces error into the result which be difficult to quantify this be test by move the stage and take measurement start at each end of the range left to right and right to left and confirm upon observe that the decline in intensity exist in both with increase distance overall the result of this experiment be quite successful the observe wavelength profile match the theory quite well all of the predict feature of the profile their shape and peak wavelength 478.9 nm for the blue lead and 551.2 nm for the green filter tungsten lamp certain improvement such a add a diffusion lamp to mix light be make during the experiment but other source of error such a the defective equipment be somewhat unavoidable perhaps the only disappoint aspect of the experiment be that the expect and measure wavelength diagreed somewhat negate the precision of interferometry a a measurement tool,expert,bal
100,2ndINT_HBQ145_Redacted,michelson interferometer with a movable mirror be use to find the null point of three different light source blue lead white lead and tungsten broadband light source the interferograms obtain be fourier transform to show the spectrum of wavelength present for the blue lead a peak wavelength at 480 ± 20 nm be found a expect in the blue region of the visible for the white lead the spectrum cover the entirety of the visible with two peak at ∼ 410 nm and ∼ 520 nm indicate that the white light be primarily make of two colour for the tungsten source a gaussian-like peak be observe rather than a black body spectrum protrude far into infrared this be explain by the drop in spectral sensitivity of the detector at wavelength great than red c onverting interference pattern from lead and black body source into a spectrum of their constituent wavelength be useful when understand the physic of semiconductor and the quantum nature of light for an lead the spectrum can give some indication of the band gap size in the semiconductor a for a black body source the temperature of the source can be determine from it spectrum this experiment will make use of a michelson interferometer to combine beam of light from a source to produce an interference pattern on a detector fig 1. schematic of a michelson interferometer light be split into two beam which reflect off mirror and recombine 1 the distribution of these fringe contains information about the source 's spectrum the objective of this experiment be to produce interferograms of a blue lead white lead and a heat tungsten source then use fourier transforms to convert the interferograms into a spectrum reveal the structure of the light emit from the source in reference to fig 2 the beam splitter separate incoming light into two beam with reduce amplitude via partial reflection 2 the two light beam travel along different arm of the interferometer and be reflect by the plane mirror m1 and m2 let the image of m2 be label m2 a distance t away from the plane mirror m1 3 after reflect off the mirror the beam recombine at the beam splitter for two monochromatic beam of wavelength λ the result of this recombination will either be destructive or constructive interference depend on the path difference between them if m1 and m2 be parallel beam inclined at angle θ to the normal of the mirror appear to be come from infinity and thus exhibit cylindrical symmetry produce circular fringe 1 the path difference between two inclined beam incident not parallel and hence m2 be tilt vertical fringe will be observe call fizeau fringe in this experiment we will be use haidinger fringe if m1 can be translate along the axis of it surface normal we can change the arm length of the michelson interfeormeter and therefore we can also change the path difference of the beam incident on the detector a the intensity of the recombine beam be dependent on the path difference ∆ we can use fourier analysis to transform the intensity spectrum i ∆ to yield a distribution i σ dependent on wavenumber σ. wavenumber be inverse wavelength and can be use to infer the wavelength present in the light 4 for a monochromatic light source and two beam of equal amplitude we can write the electric field amplitude of the combine beam in complex form a e c e 0 exp iωt e 0 exp i ωt δ therefore the intensity of the combine beam be where i 0 be a constant 4 now consider an incoherent light source that be not monochromatic let u also attribute some spectral distribution i σ to this source the total intensity be now the sum of all the intensity contribution of each of the different wavenumbers present this result be to within a constant the fourier cosine transform and thus we have show i ∆ f i σ 4 if we have a light source with a gaussian wavenumber distribution the fourier transform will also be a gaussian distribution in fig 4 a gaussian line be simulated the fourier transform show in fig 5 have a gaussian envelope and be maximum at the nullpoint the position of zero path difference hidden due to the resolution of the image be the high frequency oscillation correspond to the passing of light and dark fringe on the detector a would be observe by a michelson interferometer the michelson interferometer set-up be show in fig 6. to observe haidinger fringe with a green laser optical device be at the same height and the beam be align by adjust m2 such that the spot of green light at the detector be perfectly superpose and that the beam be incident at the centre of both mirror when use the laser source a lens be insert to produce a sharper fringe pattern on the detector the arm distance be suitably large to ensure that the fringe be large than the detector if the fringe be small than the detector measurement of average light intensity would be make which be undesirable when try to discern between light and dark fringe when use the lead a ground glass diffuser be use instead of lens to reduce the anisotropy of light emit the whole system sits on an optical bench however it be still susceptible to external vibration so any human contact with the table whilst take measurement be avoid mirror m1 be situate on a movable stage to vary the path difference the detector be connect to a computer and measurement of relative amplitude be measure a a motor move m1 the null-point be the position of zero path difference which corresponds to t 0. the intensity profile of which be fourier transform to examine the spectrum of the source to find it the green laser 's haidinger fringe be first obtain and then m1 be move in such a direction a to decrease the number of fringe this be do by eye the reason for reduce the number of fringe be because a separation t be reduce for a give fringe order m the radius of the circular fringe decrease to increase the value of co θ 3 at the centre co θ 1 and thus we can write 2t mλ we can see that fringe order decrease by 1 when 2d change by λ and hence the fringe vanish at the centre a the null-point be approach 2 once a region of minimal fringe be determine the green laser be switch for an lead or tungsten source depend on the source under investigation the motor be then programmed to scan slowly through this region at 0.001 mm/s such a speed in conjunction with the high detector sample rate of 50hz be suitable when find the null-point which be highly localise and easily miss the null-point be found and the signal see fig 7 have an approximately gaussian envelope therefore a gaussian be fit to the fourier transform see fig 8 the peak wavelength occurs at 480 ± 20 nm this lie within the range of 450 − 495nm for blue light 5 the null-point for white lead be show in fig 9. there be an asymmetry in this signal a if there be two null point we postulate this be due to two peak of different amplitude in the white lead 's spectrum the fourier transform see fig 10 reveals the spectrum occupy the entire visible spectrum spectrum a expect from a white light source however there be two primary peak situate in the region of approximately 410 nm and 520 nm or violet and green/yellow light respectively this indicates that the white lead primarily consists of two colour which we still perceive a white light the tungsten null-point fig 11 be more localise and symmetric than the white light 's suggest a broader and smoother spectrum of wavelength the correspond fourier transform be show in fig 12. this should be a black body spectrum but it be not a the tungsten heat up thermal motion of bound electron emit a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation we have not detect most of this black body spectrum due to the spectral sensitivity distribution of the silicon pin photodiode detector see fig 13 the spectral sensitivity cutoff in the infrared in no or little light be detect at wavelength great than that of visible and this be what we observe a cut-off of wavelength great than and around 1000 nm the aim of the experiment be to set-up and use a michelson interferometer to obtain interferograms of null point of various light source and use fourier transforms to show the constituent wavelength of light emit from the source the blue lead have a very symmetrical null point signal the gaussian fit to the fourier transform data place the peak wavelength at 480 ± 20 nm within the blue regime of the visible spectrum the white light have a more asymmetric null point the spectrum of which span the visible spectrum with two large peak the two peak of light be thought to give rise to the asymmetry of the null point the tungsten source spectrum be expect to be that reminiscent of a black body however due to the spectral sensitivity of the detector infrared light be lose cut the spectrum short this experiment could be improve in the follow way firstly far analysis of null point could be do for example the coherence length of the source can be estimate by measure the width of the null point envelope from this spectral width of the gaussians could be found to far characterise the light source secondly the spectral sensitivity function could be approximate a a triangle and use to deconvolute our measure signal to recover the original black body spectrum this would allow one to make a meaningful estimation of the temperature of the tungsten source use wein 's law furthermore an error not account for in this experiment be that of the motor speed this could be investigate by move the stage through large distance several time with the green laser and try to reproduce the same distance travel,deep,none
101,2ndINT_YZI659_Redacted,this report be an investigation into categorise different light source use interferometry and fourier transforms a a spectrometer five different light source be test a blue lead which yield a wavelength of 470.1 ± 8.6 nm a white lead comprise of two wavelength of 445.3 ± 10.4 nm and 562.8 ± 55.5 nm respectively these be in the red and blue part of the visible spectrum and combine to give white light a tungsten source be also test with a green and a yellow filter to give 539.9 ± 23.1 nm and 572.4 ± 30.6 nm the final source that be test be a mercury discharge lamp which have peak of 433.8 ± 20.6 nm and 547.9 ± 31.8 nm with a doublet value of 568.5 ± 1.1 nm these wavelength be that of the emission spectrum of mercury and all lie within 1.5 of the accepted value t his experiment aim to categorise light source and their spectrum by use an interferometer a a spectrometer use the technique of fourier transforms this be a very powerful technique in many different aspect of physic so it be important to ensure that knowledge of how it work be know the instrument be also very sensitive so it be easy to misalign the apparatus and get false data so great care have to be take to align it properly once this be do any source can be test and it spectrum extract ii theory this project u the technique of interferometry and fourier transforms to investigate different light source interferometry be a technique in which wave in this case the wave be electromagnetic be superimpose to cause interference information about the wave can then be extract from this pattern of interference the interferometer use in this experiment be know a a michelson interferometer it consists of a light-source that be pas into a beam-splitter which cause part of the light to pa out at a right angle form the incident ray both of these beam be then reflect off mirror before be recombine in the beam-splitter and be measure at a detector what be measure be the interference of the recombine beam at the detector these interfere due to a path difference on the two arm of the interferometer if monochromatic plane wave of wavelength λ be pas through the interferometer they will interfere constructively to cause a bright fringe when the path difference be an integer multiple of λ and destructivly to cause a dark patch when it be λ 2 this interference cause a pattern of fringe there be two type of fringe that can be see in this experiment haidinger and fizeau these occur from different orientation of the mirror a convenient way to picture this be with two mirror separate by a distance t which represent the path difference of the arm in the interferometer this be show in figure 2. since this be an extend source the angle θ will vary for all the incoming ray there will only be constructive interference to cause bright fringe when the path difference of the two ray be equal to an an integer number of wavelength so since θ varies between the ray there will only be constructive interference at specific value of θ. this cylindrical symmetry of this set up cause the haidinger fringe which be circular in shape by tilt one of the mirror this cylindrical symmetry be broken thus cause straight line fizaeu fringe this be demonstrate in the figure 3 it be the haidinger fringe that be use in this experiment a this be when the set up be correctly align the equation that governs these fringe be give by in this investigation the interferometer be be use a a spectrometer to determine wavelength of different light source this can be do by use the mathematical method of fourier transforms a fourier transform be a method that take a signal that be a function of time and decomposes it into the frequency that make it up in this way a signal can be measure on an interferogram and when a fourier transform be act on it a function of wavelength or frequency can be extract this be do by scan a sample around where t=0 which be know a the null point a corollary of fourier transforms be that a gaussian will give rise to another gaussian under a fourier transform since the light source use approximate gaussians then the transform in frequency space will also be a gaussian with an associate spread this spread in frequency space be inversely proportional to the spread in the measure signal a narrow gaussian spectral line be cause by a wide interferogram and the oposite be true for a wide spectral line this be demonstrate in the figure below it be this technique that be use to extract the information about wavelength and frequency that make up the light source this investigation look to characterise five different source of light a blue and white lead a tungsten light with green and yellow filter and a mercury discharge lamp first before any of these source be test it be require that the interferometer be set up and align correctly so that the position of the null point could be locate correctly to do this the set up show in figure 1 be construct on an optical bench care have to be take to ensure that the two mirror be equidistant from the beam-splitter so the path length would not exceed that of the coherence length this would cause no interference to occur next the set up be align use a green laser the laser be pas through the beamsplitter with a convex lens place between the two this cause the beam to spread out and aid in get the alignment correct the detector be remove and the pattern create by the two beam be observe the fix mirror have knob on it that allow for an adjustment of it tilt and these be adjust until the two beam from both mirror overlap and interference fringe could be see it be possible to see both haidinger circular and fizeau flat fringe the haidinger fringe expect can be see below once this be see the set up be align the next step be to locate the null point and this be most easily do with the same green laser one of the mirror be move via a computer at a control speed to create in interferogram this be do over a large range so that the high peak could be see and this be the null point to find this quickly though it be see that a the mirror approach the null point the circular fringe get large and also move concentrically towards the center and the opposite be true for move away this be use to gain a rough estimate of the range of value that contain the null point by observe the movement of the fringe at different value this range be then scan at a slow speed to find the exact value of the null point once the null point be locate data be able to be collect each light source be in turn place in front of the beam-splitter and a slow scan over the null point be conduct this data be then use to create an interferogram which could then be fourier transform to give graph of the intensity of light that be emit at different wavelength in this section the graph and fit of each different light source will be show displayed first be be the graph for the blue lead figure 7 show that a white lead be comprise of two distinct wavelength of λ 1 445.3nm and λ 2 562.8nm with spread of 10.4nm and 55.5nm respectively the graph see at the end of the next page be those of the tungsten lamp first with a yellow filter and second with a green filter the different peak wavelength highlight in the mercury plot can be see displayed in the table below v. discussion the first source that be test be the blue lead a can be see in the section before it have a peak wavelength of 470.1±8.6 nm a true blue phosphor lead have a wavelength of 470nm so the measure value be accurate with the expect value and also precise with an error of 1.8 it can be see in figure 6 that there be only one sharp spike in the wavelength spectrum indicate that this be the only wavelength present in the source this be what would be expect from a blue lead the next source test be the white lead in figure 7. it can be see here that there be two gaussian peak of 445.3 ± 10.4 nm and 562.8 ± 55.5 nm these peak correspond to a peak in the blue and a peak in the red part of the visible spectrum this be due to the white lead be form by a blue short wavelength lead that cause the first spike with a yellow phosphor coat this coat release red light when it interacts with the photon be release from the lead and this be what cause the second peak the combination of these two source of light be what cause the lead to be white adjust the amount of coat can adjust how red the lead be cause white lead to be either cool more blue light or warm more red light these value have a percentage error of 2.3 and 9.8 respectively but this be due to the spread of the gaussian of the wavelength a discus before a sharp spike in an interferogram cause a large spread in the wavelength so this show that the region of interference for the red light be very small when compare to white lead spectrum the measure data match the next source use be a tungsten source that have a yellow and a green filter place in front of it the spectrum for these can be see in figure 8 and 9 respectively the first be the yellow filter and this have a peak wavelength of 572.4±30.6 nm which have a percentage spread of 5.4 this wavelength be what would be expect from a yellow filter source figure 9 show the spectrum for the green filter tungsten source this have a peak wavelength of 539.9 ± 23.1 nm which have a percentage spread of 4.3 this be consistent with the expect wavelength of green light it also have a small spread than the yellow filter show that the interference range be great it can be see in both figure that there be a dip in the middle of the spectrum which look like an apparent doublet this be an anomaly that arises from misalignment of the interferometer a it pas over the null point this could be fix by more accurately align the set up and make sure that it do n't move when a new source be connect the final source test be a mercury discharge lamp see in figure 10 and 11. these two plot contain the same data but with different gaussian curve plot over them to signify two possible position of the mercury doublet the two main peak of both figure be locate at 433.8 ± 20.6 nm and 547.9 ± 31.8 nm give percentage spread of 4.7 and 5.8 these value correspond to the atomic emission spectrum of mercury which have emission line at 435.8nm and 546.1nm for violet and green spectral line these lie close to the measure value show that these value be accurate be only 0.5 and 0.3 off the accepted value it can be see also that the second peak contains two peak indicate that there be a doublet present here where the accepted value of this be 577.0nm this indicates that it be the fit show in figure 10 that be the correct fit with wavelength of 568.5 ± 1.1 nm which have percentage spread of 0.2 and lie 1.5 off the accepted value this show that this be accurate with accepted data and be also a precise measurement the aim of this report be to use the technique of interferometry and fourier transforms to measure and categorise light source use the interferometer a a spectrometer the light source that be test be a blue and a white lead a tungsten source with green and yellow filter and a mercury discharge lamp it be measure that the blue light have a wavelength of 470.1 ± 8.6 nm which be accurate with the value of the wavelength of a blue lead which be 470nm the next source test be white lead which have two peak of 445.3 ± 10.4 nm and 562.8 ± 55.5 nm respectively this translates to a peak in the blue and red part of the visible spectrum which be consistent with how white lead be form the tungsten source have peak wavelength of 572.4 ± 30.6 nm for the yellow filter and 539.9 ± 23.1 nm for the green filter light these peak be less define a the set up be not properly align which lead to there be a dip in the middle of the spectrum cause it to look like two separate peak the final source test be a mercury discharge lamp this have peak at 433.8 ± 20.6 nm and 547.9 ± 31.8 nm with a doublet value of 568.5 ± 1.1 nm these correspond to the atomic emission specrum of mercury and be 0.5 0.3 and 1.2 off the accepted value for this emission respectively,superficial,bal

interferometer show that light behaves a both a wave and a a particle a sagnac interferometer can be use for inertial navigation system the michelson interferometer can be use to analyse spectral width of light source when two coherent beam of light meet they interfere with each other create an interference pattern of light and dark fringe the type of fringe see be dependent on the difference in path length of the two beam when the fringe be localise at infinity circular haidinger fringe be observe fizeau fringe be observe when the two beam be not perfectly parallel produce linear fringe when a light source that be not monochromatic be use an interference pattern be only see over a small range by observe this interferogram the spectral width of the source and the wavelength can be determine the spectral width be define a where ∆v be the spectral width in hz c be the speed of light and l be the coherence length of the source the coherence length be the width of the interference pattern from 1 the wavelength can be found use where λ be the average wavelength and δλ be the spectral width in m. the wavelength spectrum of the source can also be found by take a fourier transform of the interferogram when work with an incandescent source the wavelength spectrum be expect to be that of a blackbody depict in figure 1 4 a blackbody absorbs all em radiation that come into contact with it and to maintain thermal equilibrium radiates at the same rate a it absorbs the energy radiate be described by where e be energy v be frequency h be planck 's constant k be boltzmann 's constant and t be temperature 5 this be base on the postulate that energy be quantise and thus suggests that light be a photon gas and that the emit radiation be only dependent on the temperature of the body and not the medium for a michelson interferometer when the pathlengths of the split beam be equal a 'null point be see a point where the light recombines perfectly in phase to produce a

flow through the system and be project into the distance use the screw gauge adj usters on the non-motorised mirror the two beam of light be align create an interference pattern the beam be adjust until haidinger fringe be see a oppose to fizeau fringe ir_ -_ m-1 figure 2 show the experimental set up for the michelson interferometer al so show be beam path through the system the beam pas from the source through the beam splitter to the motorize mirror m1 and to the non-motorised mirror m2 before be reflect and interfere a it pas through the beam splitter hit the detector w ith the laser still in place the motorise mirror be move 1mm at a time from -10mm to 10mm the number of fringe around the centre of the interference pattern be count for each this be see in figure 3. the range with minimum fringe be the range that include the null point of the interferometer figure 3 show haidinger fringe form on the detector cause by interference of the laser blocker be use to keep reflection from the imperfect mirror and beam splitter from cause error fringe be also see at one of the mirror a the beam splitter cause reflection the photodiode detector be then put back in place and the light proof box be fit around the experiment the light source be swap out for a white lead and the range include the null point be scan over the null point could then be found in a small range by analyse the interferogram the small range allow for more measurement to be take at the null point give more clear result w ith the null point well define measurement could be take with different light source the tungsten source be found to have an average wavelength of 1116±38nm and a spectral width of 158±1 1nm the source be scan around the null point a see in figure 4 and the interferogram be analyse a gaussian curve be fit to the interferogram and the full width half maximum fwhm of the curve be calculate this allow the coherence length to be found and via 1 the spectral width in hz be found the wavelength spectrum be analyse in two way one use fourier analysis and one not an average wavelength found from the fourier analysis see in figure 5 be 459±2 nm while without use fourier a see in figure 6 the average wavelength be found to be 1116±38nm these value be not within error of each other and suggest a large error than consider the tungsten source should display a blackbody spectrum it can be see from figure 5 and 6 that the fourier analyse spectrum be a much bad approximation of a blackbody and so have be discount from this the spectral width in m of 158±11 nm could be found use 2 analysis of the white lead show that the average wavelength be 675±13nm and that the spectral width be 60.4±3.3nm the white lead be use to accurately locate the null point of the set up and then an interferogram be take a see in figure 7. a gaussian curve be fit to the interferogram and the coherence length be then found the spectral width in hz be found use this information and 1 the wavelength spectrum be analyse both with and without fourier analysis see in figure 8 and 9 respectively w ithout fourier analysis the average wavelength be found to be 675±13nm while with fourier analysis it be found to be 540±2.snm similarly to the tungsten source see in iv.a the average wavelength value be in disagreement have see the fourier analysis of the tungsten to be inaccurate it be decide to ignore the fourier analyse value use this value of average wavelength and 2 the spectral width in m be found to be 60.4±3.3nm w ith a mercury lamp and a green filter in place data be take and wavelength analysis be perform due to the stability of the mercury source this wavelength should be very consistent however a see in figure 10 it be not it appear to oscillate this oscillation in wavelength occurs due to the fact that the motor can not move in even step from this spread we can find an error in measurement of the other source due to inconsistency of the motor `` `` llll l.lll `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` figure 10 demonstrates the fluctuation of calculate wavelength about the average wavelength grey-dashed for the mercury lamp with the green filter this fluctuation arises from inaccurate step take by the motor use a green filter a wavelength of 546.1 nm 6 should be found in figure 10 we see a fluctuation of wavelength of approximately 60nm around the average value the mercury lamp be scan over a longer range than the other source which when combine with the stability of the mercury source be why this fluctuation in wavelength can be more clearly see another problem found with the motor set up be that even when the motor be not move the mirror we find reading in multiple position a see in figure 11 0.8 of point be found at the incorrect position call into question again the position value of the previous measurement .. figure 11 show measurement take without move the mirror when the error in position of the mirror be take a constraint on the position 0.8 of point be found to be out of range error in measurement be found use covariant matrix and through propagation use quadrature these numerical quote error be small however the actual error for these value be much large there be the potential for error due to a misalignment of the system this and the large error attribute to the uncertainty in stage position and the irregularity of the step when the motor be move suggests that the value found for average wavelength and spectral width be inaccurate two white light source be analyse average wavelength and spectral width be found for each for the white lead the average wavelength be found to be 675±46nm and the spectral width found to be 60.4±3.3nm the incandescent tungsten source be found to have a wavelength of 1116±22nm and a spectral width of 158±11nm the error be in reality much large due to error in position of the motorise mirror meaning that the value be inaccurate the wavelength be evaluate both with and without

diode we first determine the null point of the interferometer use white light interference we record the interferograms of different light source such a white lead blue lead a white light tungsten source and the tungsten with a yellow filter the interferograms be study and provide evidence that the broader the interferogram the narrower the spectral line in 1881 albert a. michelson design an interferometer which be a device base on the phenomenon of interference of light wave that be base on the find of the experiment conduct by thomas young many year ago a michelson interferometer be a device that measure small distance through the observation of interference pattern create by recombine a split light beam with part that have travel different optical path 1 it be an important tool in experimental physic with many application in different branch of science a prominent example be the detection of gravitational wave use in ligo laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory which earn the 2017 nobel prize in physic figure 1 show the ligo site which use the michelson interferometer to detect gravitational wave 2 the michelson interferometer also played an important role in research the temperature and wind of the upper atmosphere this be possible by measure the doppler width and shift in the spectrum of aurora which be do by the wind image interferometer windii on the upper atmosphere research satellite uars 3 a the michelson interferometer determines the type of interference the condition to obtain constructive interference be for the path difference to be 𝑛𝜆 where n be an integer this mean that the two wave will be exactly in phase and will add to produce maximum intensity alternatively if the distance travel by the beam be exactly 𝑛 𝜆 destructive interference will occur lead to no light be incident on the detector this make the michelson interferometer extremely precise a move either mirror by half a wavelength lead to either a bright fringe or a dark fringe appear on the detector the nature of the fringe observe depends on the set up of the interferometer and how it be illuminate if the two mirror be not at right angle to each other and we may either send collimate light into it parallel ray come from infinity or an extend source may be use refer to figure 1 figure 2 show that look into the instrument mirror m2 appear to be at the position of m2 if the arm differ in length by t the observer see the light originate from an extend source be reflect from two mirror separate by a distance of t. we can choose either to tilt slightly one of the mirror or to leave it 'correctly align the angle 𝜃 of the incoming ray will vary ray of wavelength 𝜆 will reinforce each other at specific value of 𝜃 at which constructive interference occurs a show in figure 4 a the cylindrical symmetry show that haidinger fringe appear to be circular by tilt one mirror the cylindrical symmetry be broken so that fizeau fringe form straight line c use the interferometer a a spectrometer when a single monochromatic wave be direct into a michelson interferometer the output be a series of bright and dark fringe which can be record if the input light consists of two distinct frequency the sequence of fringe be modulate the separation between null in the interferogram be related to the separation of the two frequency in frequency space figure 5 show that the relationship be reciprocalthe closer the two frequency be to each other the far separate the null be in the interferogram 4 figure 5 show that a t be scan two wave of different λ get out of phase lead to a diminution of the contrast of the fringe however the wave will rephrase and the contrast will be restore 4 assume that the initial set-up of the interferometer with exactly equal arm length m=0 the output be observe a the mirror be be scan the actual output see be the sum of the two intensity distribution show the length of the fringe train show be such that a one move away from the zero path difference point the fringe form by the longer of the two wavelength be almost begin to 'çatch up with the fringe form by the shorter wavelength this cause the overall fringe pattern to be like that at zero order although it be only true at that point when there be only two wavelength the mathematics of fourier transforms can be apply to a source with an arbitrary spectrum the spectral line shape of a light source be approximately gaussian a the intensity be decrease with distance the broader the spectral line the narrower the interferogram from the interferograms of each different source the mean wavelength can be obtain this be possible a the path difference between two consecutive minimum on the interferogram .x be a multiple of half of the wavelength give by nl where n be a positive integer since we measure the distance between two consecutive minimum on the interferogram n be assume to be 1. we assume that this be the mean wavelength from the source and that the sample distance be constant the coherence length l could be obtain and use to find the spectral width .v with the fo1mula c v x l 2n 2 where c be the speed of light 4 to tum this into wavelength the fo1mula 3 where a be the mean wavelength of the source 4 before we begin constrncting the michelson interferometer we developed a simulation of the interferometer and study the type of result expect we could manipulate variable such a the speed at which the lliltor move how far the lliltor move between sample a well a the number of sample take this be possible a the sample rate be constant at 50 hz the simulation give an output expect from a light source with a give gaussian profile and specify width it be also possible to reconstrnct the light source use a fourier transfo1m

piano-convex with a focal length of 100 mm this be position in front of the fix lliltor use a string and rnler the adjustable lliltor be position perpendicular to the beamsplitter-fixed miitor line it be ensure there be no 'double point so both miitors be parallel to the beam-splitter a white card be place in front of the photodetector to far align the interferometer this be do by tilt the adjustable lliltor to have the laser spot from both aim of the beam-splitter directly on top of each other at the output once the interferometer be align the photodetector be connect to the computer via usb the photodetector be a photodiode attach to an amplifier with a variable gain which sainples at a rate of 50 hz we proceed with the task of seai•ching for the null point of the inteferometer which be define a the point at which t 0. this be study by use the white lead source and observe the interference pattern throughout the movement of the mirror white light be the optimum choice a it have a wide range of frequency which translates to a narrow peak on the interferogram which be easy to notice once the interferometer be set up we start take interferograms of other light source these include a blue lead white light tungsten source with green and yellow filter the procedure be repeat for the white lead with a small range of distance around the null point to give a high resolution for the interferogram we use a range of 2.40mm -2.415mm with a speed of 5𝑥10 −5 mm -1 the process be repeat with the other aforementioned light source and the gain of the photodetector be varied depend on the light source a show in figure 21331 the spike occurs at the null point where t 0. the null point be found to be 2.40816 ± 0.00002 mm and the uncertainty in position be determine by visualling zoom in the interferogram the range of distance be narrow down close to the null point and the interferogram for white lead obtain be a show in figure 9. the blue lead produce a broader interferogram than the white lead with a peak wavelength of … a show in figure 10. table i show the feature of the interferograms that be study without perform fft along with it uncertainty overall the value of ∆λ be small and this may be due to approximation and assumption involve in the equation they do however provide evidence that the broader the interferogram l the narrower ∆λ which be show in the blue lead and tungsten source with a yellow filter in this experiment we construct a michelson interferometer from scratch and align it with a green laser diode this be proceed with find the null point use white light interference we produce interferograms of different light source such a blue lead tungsten white light source a well a the tungsten source with a yellow filter the interferograms be study and it be conclude that the broader the interferogram the narrower the spectral line and ∆λ a few issue encounter throughout this experiment a this be a highly sensitive instrument in the process of take data the point on the graph look to be discrete and background noise affected the data which result in readjustment of the gain a well a realignment of the beamsplitter we be also unable to proceed with perform fft on each of the interferograms a there be a problem with the code provide a few suggestion for improvement for this experiment would be to use well light source such a light source with high intensity so that the data would not be affected by background noise,deep,the

be found to be equal to 102𝑛𝑚 ± 2𝑛𝑚 the mean wavelength be estimate a 583𝑛𝑚 ± 102𝑛𝑚 the value of the mean wavelength obtain be compatible because it fell into the wavelength range of yellow light which be 570𝑛𝑚 − 590𝑛𝑚 9 to calculate the temperature of the tungsten source the filter be remove from the source figure 8 be use to obtain the spectral feature require for calculate the temperature of the tungsten source the coherence length be estimate a 201.1𝑛𝑚 ± 4.2𝑛𝑚.the spectral width be calculate a 266.0𝑛𝑚 ± 5.6𝑛𝑚 it be note that the spectral width of the tungsten source and the white lead be nearly identical because they have similar colour distribution the mean wavelength be estimate a 580𝑛𝑚 ± 266𝑛𝑚 the estimate value of the mean wavelength be meaningful because it fell into the wavelength range of white visible light which be 380𝑛𝑚 − 750𝑛𝑚 9 a a result use equation 4 the temperature of the tungsten source be calculate a 4997𝐾 ± 2292𝐾 the associate uncertainty of the value of temperature be calculate use quadrature 7 the equation use can be found in part c of the appendix the estimate value of the mean wavelength for each light source be compatible because they fell into the wavelength range of their respective colour in light 's visible spectrum the spectral width value calculate be meaningful because their associate uncertainty be small the spectral width of white light be the large because it have a large spread of component frequency lead to a large error on the mean wavelength value of the white lead and the white tungsten source the value of temperature of the white light tungsten source without the filter calculate in part d of this section be compatible because the range create by the uncertainty include the true value of temperature of the white light tungsten source which be equal to about 5000𝐾 6 the error of the temperature value be large because the large uncertainty of the mean wavelength value of the white light tungsten source lead to a significantly large error on the temperature value the theoretical value of temperature of the white light tungsten source be approximate by consider the planck distribution of light give off by a black body at temperature t 6 white light have equal part of red blue and green therefore consider wien 's law 6 the temperature of the white light tungsten source be about 5000𝐾 far to verify that the predict temperature of 5000𝐾 be reasonable the planck distribution be use to calculate the intensity of red green and blue wavelength of light at the predict temperature use a computational method a colour be generate that match the colour of the lamp use in the experiment the aim of this experiment be to calculate the spectral width the coherence length and the mean wavelength of each of the four light source use the approximate value of the coherence length of the white lead the blue lead the white light tungsten source without the yellow filter and the tungsten source with the yellow

because their associate uncertainty be small in addition the calculate value of spectral width be approximately equal to the width of the gaussian on the fourier transform plot for each light source show that the spectral width value be reasonable it be note that the interferogram of the blue lead source be wider than that of white light the blue lead therefore have a narrower spectral line than the spectral line of white light the white lead source give the interferogram with the least width because in general for white light interference fringe cancel out since they occur at different place possible error could have result because of the high level of noise far implementation should look to isolate the interferometer from all surround motion to reduce the noise additionally through convolution 7 it will be possible to statistically account for the background noise and systematic error in addition the fitting error of the gaussian fit could have be consider by use the covariance

105,2ndINT_GTD911_Redacted,we investigate different light source by the mean of a michelson interferometer the interferometer be set up from scratch use the part give and align use a laser the null point of the interferometer be determine use white light interference we record the interferograms of a white lead a blue lead a white light tungsten source and the tungsten with a yellow filter the interferograms be study and we perform fast fourier transform which decompose the interferograms into their spectral distribution they all signify that the relationship between the width of the interferogram and the spectral width of the wavelength that make up the light be reciprocal i n 2016 scientist successfully detect the first direct evidence of gravitational wave use the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ligo a show in figure 1. this work earn three researcher the 2017 nobel prize in physic in october 2017. an interferometer be a very powerful tool in experimental physic with application extend into other branch of science in our experiment we investigate the different light source by use a particular type of interferometer call the michelson interferometer the light source include white lead blue lead tungsten source and the tungsten source with a yellow filter our interest be in determine the spectral distribution of each source with the help of fast fourier transform routine in python fig 1 ligo experiment which also use the michelson interferometer to detect gravitational wave 1 ii theory in general there be number of type of optical instrument that form optical interference these instrument be classify under the generic name of interferometer the michelson interferometer be one of the simplest yet one of the most important of all interferometer 2 the layout of a michelson interferometer be show in figure 2 below the light emit from the source be split into two perpendicular beam by a beamsplitter which be a partially-silvered mirror the reflect beam a travel to a mirror m1 and the transmit beam b travel to another mirror m2 both ray be reflect at their respective mirror and they undergo a partial reflection and recombination at the beamsplitter upon return 2 fig 2 a diagram of the michelson interferometer setup 3 in order to understand how the interferometer produce intereference of light consider monochromatic plane wave of wavelength λ and uniform wavevector k emit from the source the recombine plane wave at the beamsplitter will interfere and the path difference of the two beam will determine the type of interference when the distance from the beamsplitter to m1 be exactly the same a the distance from the beamsplitter to the mirror m1 then the two beam will interfere constructively produce a bright plane wave output alternatively the two beam will interfere destructively if the path difference of the beam a and b be exactly λ/2 this lead to no light be incident on the detector hence move mirror a or mirror b by a fraction of λ make the difference between a bright fringe appear on the detector or a dark fringe appear there this make the michelson interferometer an extraordinarily precise ruler there will be a phase change for one of the beam due to the presence of dielectric plate on one side of the beamsplitter so the destructive intereference occurs at zero path difference result in a dark fringe instead of the expect bright fringe 3 it be important to think about what kind of fringe we be expect when look into a michelson interferometer the nature of the fringe depend mainly on the set up pf the instrument and how it be illuminate it be also possible that the two end mirror be not exactly at right angle to each other and we may send collimate light into it parallel ray come from infinity i.e plane wave or use an extend source we consider use an extend source and set the mirror at right angle to each other figure 2 show mirror m2 appear to be at position of m2 if the arm differ by length t the observer see the light originate from an extend source be reflect from two mirror separate by t a show in figure 3. let u see what happens when we choose to tilt slightly one of the mirror or to leave it 'correctly alligned the angle θ of the incoming ray will vary in both case beam of wavelength λ will interfere constructively for specific vale of θ. the cylindrical symmetry in the case in figure 4 suggests the fringe will appear circular and call haindinger fringe this be broken when one mirror be tilt so that so-called fizeau fringe form straight line c. use the interferometer a a spectrometer an optical spectrometer be an instrument use to separate and measure component of light which be call a spectrum 4 when a single monochromatic wave be sent into a michelson interferometer the output be just a series of bright and dark fringe which can be record electronically if the input light consists of two distinct frequency the sequence of bright and dark fringe interferogram be modulate and the separation between the null in the interferogram be related to the separation of the two frequency in frequency space over the course the wave rephase and the contrast be restore figure 5 provide clear view on why the relationship be reciprocal 3 let u imagine the interferometer be set up with exactly equal arm length the output be then monitor a the mirror be scan the actual output see be the sum of the two intensity distribution show the length of the fringe train show be such that a one move away from the zero path difference point the fringe form by the longer of the two wavelength be almost begin to 'catch up with the one form by shorter wavelength the overall fringe pattern be more or less the same a it be at zero point for light make up of two wavelength the mathematics of fourier transforms can be use to treat a source with arbitrary spectrum the basic idea of fourier transform be that it decomposes a function of time or space and represent it in frequency space show the constituent frequency that make it up 2 in our experiment a computer will be use to perform these complicate calculation it should also be note that the spectral line shape of a light source be approximately gaussian due to fall intensity of the source over the distance figure 6 show that a gaussian spectral feature lead to a gaussian spatial feature iii method before move on to build the michelson interferometer we developed a simulation of the interferometer and study what type of result we should expect among the variable we be manipulate be the speed at which the mirror move and hence how far the mirror move between the sample since the sample rate of the detector will be constant the number of sample could also be varied the skeleton program provide simulated the output that be expect from a light source with a gaussian profile and specify width the computer we use have the linux operating system therefore some time be use to familiarise ourselves the simulated output be deconstrusted use a fourier transform function built in the code call fast fourier transform fft in addition to that we also explore nyquist theorem on our simulation to get a well comprehension on how to obtain result with high resolution 3 for instance the affect of sample distance and the total distance move by the mirror on the reconstruct spectrum be investigate by vary them and observe the fft result the entire experiment involve the michelson interferometer be carry in a dark room to prevent external bright light source from disrupt the measurement hence it should be note there be a trip hazard one of the mirror be connect to a linear motor stage which be fix to the base the mirror be front surface and we try to avoid touch them or clean them after touch figure 7 show the set up of the interferometer firstly the beamsplitter be connect to a class 3r green laser and be position in front of the fix mirror stage 3 this be follow by the other adjustable mirror perpendicular to the beamsplittermirror stage line the laser be switch on and the reflection of the beam on the beamsplitter be observe we handle it cautiously so there be no stray beam it be ensure there be no 'double-points so both mirror be parallel to the beamsplitter to far align the interferometer the output of the interferometer be observe by place a white screen in front of the photodetector a show in the diagram the adjustable mirror be tilt in order to have the laser spot from the two arm directly on top of each other at the output the use of lens help observe the fringe more clearly specifically two lens -one to expand the laser beam into a broaden source and another to image laser onto the screen figure 8 show the fringe observe and the centre spot be chosen to be place on top of the opening of the detector so that it could detect the change in intensity more clearly now that interferometer be align the photodetector be connect to the pc the photodetector be a photodiode attach to an amplifier with variable gain and by default this sample the signal at a rate of 50hz to test if the photodetector a well a the software work the interferogram of the laser be take by move the mirror at a speed of 5 × 10 −4 mm −1 this be not really a solid test a the laser wavelength may drift however this be to familiarise ourselves to handle and analyse the data after obtain result we expect we move on to find the null point of the interferometer the null point be define a the point at which t =0 this be study use a white lead and observe it interference over the range of movement of the mirror white light be use a it contain a wide range of frequency therefore produce a narrow peak on the interferogram which be easy to notice the lens be remove for this source to be more efficient we measure the arm length use a ruler and narrow the range of the null point significantly we ran the motor at 3 × 10 −3 mm −1 with 5 × 10 4 sample the speed be chosen so that the detector can take at least 20 reading between the expect width of the peak in accordance with nyquist theorem for well resolution a 'spike be observe and it indicate the null point at which the intensity be the high the interferogram be zoom in digitally and the exact position of the null point be determine by move the cursor now the interferometer have be set up properly to start investigate the different light source the procedure be repeat for the white lead with a small range of distance around the null point for a high resolution interferogram the range use be between -4.54mm and -4.51mm with a speed of 1 × 10 −3 mm −1 the interferogram be save for far analysis by use the python code give we perform fft on the interferogram obtain and the offset involve with it be already rectify in the code the output associate with fft give the range of wavelength that make up the white light source with respect to it amplitude and be save the white lead be then replace with a blue lead and the result interferogram and the wavelength spectrum be study the same be carry out with a white light tungsten source and the tungsten source with a yellow filter the gain of the photodetector be varied depend on the intensity of the source from the inteferograms of each type of source the mean wavelength can be obtain when we observe two consecutive minimum on an interferogram the path difference ∆x between the two beam be a multiple of a half of the wavelength give by where n be a positive integer we measure the distance between two consecutive minimum by zoom into the interferogram and record their coordinate so n in this case be equal to 1. we assume the wavelength obtain from this be the mean wavelength of the source and that the sample distance be constant the coherence length l could also be obtain coherence length be the distance over which one arm of the michelson interferometer can be scan before the interferogram contrast becomes poor subsequently the spectral width ∆ υ which be give by where c be the speed of light be calculate 3 to turn this into wavelength we use where λ be the mean wavelength of the source 3 firstly we look at the output when the interferogram of the green laser be take a show in figure 9a the output be a expect series of area of low and high intensity in a sinusoidal pattern this corresponds to the destructive and constructive interference of the two beam at the photodetector the signal be not gaussian at first because the null point be not found yet a this be only to make u get use to the data handle next we consider the null point of the interferogram a show in figure 9b the spike occurs when the all the wavelength of the white light lead interfere constructively at the null point i b the 'spike signifies the null point a the wave interfere constructively fig 9 the range of distance be narrow down close to the null point and the interferogram obtain for white lead be show in figure 10a a surprising result come out when the fft be perform on the white lead interferogram show on figure 10b the shape of the spectrum be accurate since it be wide and continuous compare to the real spectrum of white lead in figure 10c there be a small peak on the left of the spectrum which signifies the blue wavelength associate within the colour white however the surprising element be the horizontal shift of the spectrum the wavelength at the peak have be shift to twice the actual value originally in the python code for the fft we double the sample distance to take the path difference due to the mirror 's movement into account and the spectrum look normal when we remove the double procedure this be weird a this give accurate result for the other source nonetheless we highly suspect the problem be within the code and the shape of the spectrum be still satisfy fig 10 on the other hand the blue lead produce a much broader interferogram than the white lead a indicate by figure 11a not surprisingly this look more similar to the simulation in figure 10d a the range of frequency in the blue lead be very narrow the fft of the interferogram in figure 11b reveal that the spectrum be very narrow with the peak wavelength around 480nm compare to the real spectrum in figure 11c the result for the blue lead be a expect and also verifies the reciprocal relationship between the range of wavelength and width of the interferogram the blue lead be now replace with a white tungsten source the interferogram obtain be show in figure 12a the output look very similar to the white lead a both source consist of wide range of wavelength thus produce narrow interferograms after the fft procedure show in figure 12b the wavelength spectrum seem to be broad and continuous just like the white lead a closer inspection reveals that most of the spectrum lie on the infrared region and indicates that most of the energy be dissipate a heat rather than visible light similar to the real spectrum in figure 12e the tungsten source be then connect to a yellow filter figure 12c show the interferogram obtain and be similar to the blue lead 's one a expect the fft see figure 12d indicates a very narrow spectrum centre around a wavelength of 600nm which be the wavelength that corresponds to the colour yellow the noise around the peak could be related to the very low intensity of the source couple with the large gain of the photodetector to improve this a brighter tungsten source should be use it be also interest to notice that in figure 12c there be small peak on the side of the middle peak and this be not in the case of blue lead it just could be noise from the aforementioned issue or an effect due to the very narrow spectrum of wavelength more experiment must be do before any real conclusion can be make now the interferograms of each type of source mention above be study to investigate a few feature without need to perform the fft method from the code the result be summarise in table i. the mean wavelength λ be calculate by use equation 1. subsequently equation 2 and 3 be use to calculate the spectral width in both ∆υ and ∆λ form the mean wavelength of all the source be similar to the result from fft except for the white lead this suggests the issue be with the code a mention before also overall the value of ∆λ be significantly small than what we observe in fft this be probably due to the approximation and assumption involve in the equation yet they all show similar trend broad interferograms have small ∆λ in the case of blue lead and the tungsten source with yellow filter we could also predict the temperature t in kelvin of the tungsten filament from the mean wavelength obtain use wien 's displacement law which be give by the equation below 3 t λ 2.898 × 10 −3 therefore we obtain a temperature of 3500 − 400 k which show the tungsten use follow a similar distribution a the red curve in figure 12e we investigate different light source by the mean of a michelson interferometer the interferometer be set up from the scratch use the part give and align use a laser the null point of the interferometer be determine use white light interference we record the interferograms of a white lead a blue lead a white light tungsten source and the tungsten with a yellow filter the interferograms be study and we perform fast fourier transform which decompose the interferograms into their spectral distribution they all signify that a broad spectrum of wavelength of light will produce broad interferograms overall this be not an easy experiment to carry out a the highly sensitive instrument be prone to even a small error we encounter a few problem during the experiment such a when we be take the measurement to find the null point the instrument kept give weird result and it take a considerable amount of time to figure it out apart from that the code and the software provide have a few issue for example the software have a limit for the number of sample it could record this might make u miss important point during the measurement since the motor be move even though the detector stop record to improve the more sophisticated method of handle data should be use besides more variety of source with different spectrum should be investigate to far study the reciprocal relationship,extended,the
106,2ndINT_XUQ367_Redacted,in this experiment we use a michelson interferometer to determine the spectrum of a white lead a blue lead tunsten light source with a green and yellow filter and a mercury discharge lamp the spectrum have gaussian fit to them to measure mean wavelength and the standard deviation be estimate to calculate coherence length the white lead have a mean wavelength of 506.8 ± 0.5nm with a coherence length of 2.48 ± 0.01μm and the blue lead have a mean wavelength of 470.1 ± 0.1nm with a coherence length of 5.36 ± 0.9μm the tungsten light source with a green and yellow filter have a mean wavelength of 542.5 ± 1nm and 577.4 ± 1nm respectively with coherence length of 5.36 ± 0.12μm and 4.58 ± 0.18μm respectively the mercury discharge lamp have a mean wavelength of 512.2 ± 0.8nm with a coherence length of 5.01 ± 0.5μm in this experiment we be investigate different light source by analyse their interferograms use a michelson interferometer interferometry be an important technique that have be use throughout science to prove fundamental theory in physic such a detect gravitation wave to disprove that light travel through an ether the interferometer work by partially splitting a beam of light and recombines them at the beam splitter the light will interfere at the beam splitter cause an interference pattern by investigate the interference pattern around the null point of the interferometer with a photometer a wave profile can be make for each of the light source by use fourier analysis the data obtain can be use to calculate spectral width of the source wavelength of the source and therefore coherence length to characterise the different light source the light source use be a white lead blue lead tungsten lamp with a yellow and a green filter and a mercury discharge lamp a diagram of the michelson interferometer be show below in figure 1. when the light beam split the reflect can travel in either two path path s1 or path s2 the beam splitter be make up of a partially silver surface and a dialectic plate that cause a phase change in the s2 beam if the path difference between s1 and s2 be an integer multiple of the wavelength of the light destructive interference would occur due to the dielectric plate cause a phase change when the wave recombine the amplitude of the recombine light can be give by equation 1. where e be the amplitude of light ωis the angular frequency of light t be time σis the wave number of the light wave i.e 1/wavelength and d be the path difference between the interfere light beam however the photometer do not measure amplitude directly but intensity instead intensity of any wave be give by the modulus square of the amplitude of the wave thus the intensity for a particular value of σis give by equation 2. it should be note that the amplitude e be a function of σ a the light source will have vary wavelength and hence vary the density of wave number σis related to the fourier transform of the interferogram record 2 where i d be intensity of light a a function of path difference between the interfere light source the full derivation of this be in appendix a. the intensity of light detect depends upon the interference pattern observe with the interferometer follow a gaussian distribution due to the fact that two interfere light source interfere a wave packet this mean that the fourier transform return another gaussian distribution and hence spectral width of the source can be calculate from equation 4 ∆ν c λ 2 ∆λ 4 where δλis the spectral width of the light source c be the speed of light λis the wavelength of the light source and δλis the wavelength width spectral width of a light source can be use to calculate coherence length coherence length be a measure of the distance over which one arm of a michelson interferometer can be scan before the interferogram visibility becomes poor citation the coherence length can be calculate from equation 5. where l be the coherence length in the case of interference pattern two type of fringe can occur if the mirror be align such that they be at exact right angle to each other and to the surface the interfere light source appear to come from an infinite distance away cause circular fringe if one mirror be at an angle in respect to the other mirror fizau fringe occur which appear more linear the equation govern the angle be give by equation 6. where t be the seperation of the mirror θis the respective angle m be the order of interference which be an integer and be the wavelength of light the null point be when t=0 a more define interferogram can be take by scan over the null point and be therefore important to the experiment the interferometer be set up on a stable stage so that the optical element could be fix we make sure that the mirror be at approximately equal length it do not need to be precise a mirror 2 move on a translational stage to find the null point a laser be use a the light source in the interferometer a convex lens be attach at the recombination point at the beam splitter which have a focal length of 24.5mm the photometer be move out of the way of the beam and a screen be place at a distance away from the beam splitter mirror 1 be adjust until haidinger fringe appear by move mirror 2 slowly the circular fringe will either appear to be move inwards or outwards depend on the direction of movement of mirror 2. the null point be the point at which the ring change direction from move inwards to outwards or vice-versa the haidinger fringe be difficult to notice with the light source use in the investigation unless close to the null point therefore the green laser be use a the fringe pattern be much more noticeable at distance just over 10mm away from the null point a precise figure for our null point can not be give a it change depend on each laboratory session due to external influence move the optical element once the null point be found the green laser be carefully remove so that the beam splitter do not move and the light source be put in place anomalous result can be cause by stray ray interfere with the ray that go through the beam splitter this be reduce by place the light source in a matte black tube that collimate the light source and matte black card place towards the end of this tube to far reduce stray ray the interferogram be measure by vary the distance move by mirror 2 over small distance of roughly 0.25mm the interferogram be measure by the photometer and the data be record directly to a computer that can process the data to a fourier transform safety precaution have to be make when use the different light source when handle the green laser it be important not to shine any light directly into someone 's eye include the interference pattern light furthermore the mercury discharge lamp also emits uv light which be ionise and can cause blindness to avoid the danger of uv safety goggles be worn when the lamp be turn on to avoid effect of uv exposure to our eye a white lead be make from a blue lead with a yellow phosphor therefore 2 gaussian distribution should be observe from the fourier transform the interferogram of the white lead be asymmetrical due to misalignment of the interferometer this can affect the result but not to a substantial degree of accuracy the spectrum show two spectral line that be in a gaussian distribution the peak wavelength of the blue spectral line be 445.3 ± 0.2nm with a standard deviation of 10.4 ± 0.2nm and the peak wavelength of the yellow phosphor spectral line be 562.8 ± 0.2nm with a standard deviation of 55.5 ± 1nm the latter spectral line be just above the boundary of the yellow-green spectrum so can therefore be except a a non anomalous result the value be obtain by use computer optimisation that also return value for the uncertainty in peak wavelength the mean wavelength of the whole lead be calculate by use amplitude a a weight factor in the mean which be calculate to be 506.8±0.5nm the standard deviation be use to calculate the spectral width meaning that δλ= 24.5 ± 0.9 for the blue part of the spectrum and δλ= 103.7 ± 1nm for the yellow part of the spectrum this give a combine δλof 128.2±2nm from 4 we calculate δνto be 121.0±1thz then use 3 the coherence length be calculate to be 2.48 ± 0.01 μm next we analyse the blue lead the interferogram and fourier transform be show in figure 4 and 5 respectively the blue lead have a gaussian peak at 470.1±0.1nm with a standard deviation of 20.3 ± 0.1nm this meant that the δλfor the blue lead be 20.3 ± 0.1 result in a value for δνto be calculate at 27.5 ± 0.3thz therefore the coherence length be 5.36 ± 0.9μm we analyse the tungsten light source with a green filter and a yellow filter the interferogram for the green filter tungsten light be show below the interferogram pattern show in figure 6 be due to the nature of the filter the green filter transmits light in gaussian form with a peak wavelength of 543.5 ± 2nm with a standard deviation of 4.2 ± 0.8nm 4 this mean that the result interferogram be a resultant of a convolution with the filter and the tungsten light source from figure 7 we fit a single gaussian curve and two separate gaussian curve the peak wavelength of the single gaussian curve be found to be 539.9 ± 1.2nm and the mean wavelength of the two gaussian curve be found to be 542.5 ± 1.1nm the two mean wavelength be similar so it be possible that these two peak be due to a small misalignment that cause the interferogram of the white light it could also be cause by distance between sample take be too large this be also cause the single gaussian peak to have a small amplitude a all the point be use in the optimisation however the amplitude do not affect the mean wavelength for the single peak the mean wavelength from the two gaussian peak would leave out the dip in the fourier transform therefore if we assume that the dip be an anomalous result the mean wavelength of 542.5 ± 1nm would be more accurate from use the two gaussian peak a our accepted result the spectral width be found to be 55.9 ± 0.2thz use 5 we obtain a value of 5.36 ± 0.12μm the result for the tungsten light with the yellow filter be show below the interferogram for the tungsten light source with the yellow filter have a similar shape to the tungsten light source with the green filter for the same reason again a single gaussian fit do not seem appropriate but from analysis of the other two curve the mean wavelength be calculate to be 577.4 ± 1nm the spectral width be calculate to be 65.5 ± 0.2thz which obtains a coherence length of 4.58 ± 0.18μm the error give for the tungsten light source for the wavelength be give by the fit for the curve however these error may not be the true value of the error a the two peak fit for the tungsten light source be not a accurate a the other fit for the white lead and blue lead the final light source that be observe and scan around the null point be the mercury discharge lamp the interferogram do not have a distinct gaussian peak this be due to the fact that mercury lamp have many spectral line two different curve be fit to the spectrum of the mercury lamp to investigate the appearance of a doublet in 500-600nm part of the mercury lamp spectrum the initial parameter of the optimisation be change in order to identify any doublet however the mercury spectral line be not distinct which make it difficult to identify the doublet from the curve fit with two peak the mean wavelength be calculate to be 512.2 ± 0.8nm with a δλof 54.4 ± 0.7nm therefore the spectral width be calculate to be 5.99 ± 0.7thz with a coherence length of 5.01 ± 0.5μm.it be know that mercury emits light in the uv spectrum despite this no light be detect in the uv range this be because the photometer detects light within a certain range of wavelength this be discus far in the appendix concern the derivation of the fourier transform v. conclusion in this experiment we be use a michelson interferometer to determine the spectrum and coherence length of different light source this be do by measure the signal of the interfere beam and obtain an interferogram for the light source a fourier transform of the interferogram make a spectrum for the light source so that coherence length can be calculate the white lead and blue lead have spectrum 's that have gaussian curve which be a expect however the tungsten lamp with the filter do not have a strong gaussian fit this could be due to misalignment but be be more likely that the sample rate be not high enough affect the fourier transform obtain if the tungsten experiment be to be repeat again a high sample rate would obtain a well spectrum for tungsten light with the filter the mercury lamp interferogram be not distinctive due to the fact that mercury have many more spectral line than lead however the fourier transform return a two peak that be relatively gaussian which meant that calculation could be perform if the whole experiment be to be repeat each interferogram should be measure more than once to obtain an average in order to reduce random error word count:2290

107,2ndINT_LSK572_Redacted,the michelson interferometer be use a spectroscope to examine different type of light source around the null point a white lead blue lead white tungsten source with green and yellow filter and a green laser be use within the interferometer to obtain interferograms from the interferograms the spectral width be calculate and compare with the theoretical relationship that a great spectral width corresponds to a longer coherence length the michelson interferometer be an experimental device which utilises interference to measure wavelength and fringe separation with great precision on the order of several nanometre it be first use in the michelson-morley experiment to attempt to measure the relative motion of earth to the ethera hypothesise medium for electromagnetic wave 1 this laid the foundation which eventually lead to the first detection of gravitational wave in 2015 by ligo 2 the setup of the michelson interferometer be relatively simple give the level of precision the interferometer consists of two mirror a beam splitter with an attach dielectric plate a source of monochromatic wave and a detector the mirror m2 be fix while mirror m1 be mount on a moveable stage which can be move towards or far away from the beam splitter the beam splitter be compose of a glass plate with a silver surface the silver surface cause the incident ray from the source to be split into two beam one beam pas through towards m2 while the other be reflect towards m1 the two beam be reflect by their respective mirror and recombine once again at the beam splitter before be measure by the detector the dielectric plate cause a phase shift of the beam go towards b by λ/2 the two beam will recombine accord to the principle of superposition since both beam originate from the same monochromatic and coherent source interference will occur when the beam be in phase and the peak of one beam coincides with the peak of the other constructive interference will occur when in antiphase the peak of one beam will be counteract by the trough of the other cause destructive interference the phase difference between the two beam which be reflect off the mirror m1 and m2 will depend on the distance between m1 and the beam splitter m2 be the position of m1 which would be equidistant from the beam splitter a m2 this be refer to a the null point which be when t 0 where t be the distance between m1 and m2 when t be equal to zero or an integer multiple of λ constructive interference would be expect at the detector while if t be equal to an odd integer multiple of λ/2 destructive interference would be expect to be see however due to the dielectric plate on the beam splitter the opposite be see so that destructive interference occurs when there be no path difference constructive interference corresponds to a bright fringe while destructive interference corresponds to a dark fringe the light source be use throughout this experiment can be consider a extend source due to the width of the incident ray laser source be use in conjunction with a lens which widens the ray this make the alignment of the interferometer easy a the fringe be more visible the pattern of the fringe depends on the tilt of mirror m2 a extend source be be use interference depends on the angle of the incident ray which strike the mirror some specific angle will lead to path difference which be an integer multiple of λ between consecutive ray if m1 and m2 be perpendicular circular haidinger fringe be visible which be the one present in this experiment if m2 be tilt straight fizeau fringe be present instead michelson interferometer the interferometer can be use a a spectrometer by take measurement around the null point for a single monochromatic wave from the source the detector would measure a series of bright and dark fringe if the light source be compose of two or more distinct wavelength then the record output would not be a simple series of fringe for example beating be present in the interferogram when there be two distinct wavelength the two distinct wavelength also correspond to two distinct frequency depend on the frequency the interferogram for each single frequency will be slightly different both will display a maximum at the null point and a series of oscillation between maximum and minimum which be symmetrical around the null point however the distance between subsequent maximum will be different depend on the wavelength or frequency a high frequency lead to a shorter distance between the maximum since there be two distinct frequency the distance between the maximum of one of the frequency and the maximum of the other be change a measurement be take far from the null point however the two maximum will coincide at several point include the null point when this happens the interferogram of both combine will display an intensity that be at a maximum point in between these maximum will show a decrease to a minimum before increase in intensity until the next maximum the distance between the maximum on the interferogram be determine by the difference in frequency of the two wave a small difference in frequency lead to a great distance a the maximum of the separate wave will coincide less often the incoming source of the michelson interferometer can be represent with an electromagnetic spectrum graph the distinct wavelength mention before would be model by a dirac distribution 3 these be also call spectral line a the width of the spectrum be very narrow most source do not have a single spectral line a they have a range of frequency which be present this can be represent by a gaussian distribution which be centre around the frequency which be most prevalent in the source 4 the spectral width of such a source refers to the range of frequency that make up the incident light on the beam splitter the interferogram which be output by the michelson interferometer can be analyse by use fourier transforms this process return the electromagnetic spectrum which show the range of frequency which the source contains however the interferograms be skewed which lead to fourier transforms not be a effective in these case there be formula which can be use to calculate the spectral width of the source where ∆𝜈 be the spectral width in hz l be the coherence length in m and c be the speed light in a vacuum coherence length can be found on the interferogram and be the distance over which the interferometer be effective at scan this can then be convert into a range of wavelength use the follow formula where λ be the mean wavelength in m and ∆𝜆 be the range of wavelength present in the source due to the interferograms be slant the fourier transforms be not a effective at return the mean frequency and spectral width therefore the two above equation can be use to find these two value there be an inverse relationship between the spectral width and the coherence length the narrower the spectral width the broader the coherence length of the interferogram the mean frequency be calculate by use the frequency of the oscillation in the interferogram the simulation follow the theory that a wider spectral width lead to a narrower interferogram the simulation be run use a red laser source although a green one be use when take data the same scale be use for the distance from the null point on the x ax on both fig 4 and fig 5. a simulation of a white light source be also useful so that the predict pattern around the null point be know this give a basis of comparison when attempt to find the null point use a white lead source the interferometer be align use a green laser source and lens which increase the diameter of the light incident on the beam splitter m2 be adjust by use precise screw which tilt the mirror the mirror m2 be tilt until fringe be visible at the output the stage be move by use the linux console there be three parameter which be input into the software for the move stage end point speed of stage and number of measurement the detector have a sample rate of 50 hz which be equivalent to 50 measurement occur every second the beam splitter be securely bolt down so that it move minimally when attach or remove different source however the equipment be extremely sensitive and precise and so the null point constantly shift when change source the interferometer also require realignment at the start of every lab session this alignment take upwards of 40 minute the first time it be attempt a we get more familiar with the equipment this be manage in 10 minute or less the first interferogram be a green laser source it be take to get familiar with use the linux console to record measurement however the suppose monochromatic source show beating which suggests a second less intense wavelength be also present in the source this can be compare to the interferogram show in fig 3 which be for two distinct frequency be present a this be not the desire result a new green laser be use which be monochromatic the number of sample take lead to an interferogram which be difficult to analyse there be an increase in amplitude the far to the right the stage move this suggests that the null point be present at a distance that be far to the right the null point of a monochromatic source would be when the interferogram be at a maximum however the entire gaussian distribution for the interferogram be much wider on the order of several millimetre there be a payoff between the time it take to record the data and the resolution if the resolution be high which corresponds with the stage move at a slow rate it take longer to record since there be limited lab time quick calculation be make to reach a compromise between the two factor a white lead source be now use to try and find the null point the pattern show in fig 5 be the one which corresponds to the null point for a white light source first a rough and low resolution interferogram be take around where the null point be estimate to be locate the range of the measurement would be a few millimetre and the null point would be show a a vertical line in the data then a second high resolution interferogram be take around this point to obtain one that be similar to the simulation show in fig 5. the record interferogram for the white lead be asymmetric while the simulation displayed an interferogram that be symmetrical about the null point this may be due to imperfection of the mirror or the beam splitter this asymmetry be also found when the interferogram be record again which suggests an error within the setup be the cause with the null point have be found we can use the interferometer a a spectroscope for other light source the light source which be be investigate be a white lead blue lead and a white light tungsten source with a green and yellow filter the interferogram for the white light tungsten source with the green filter be not include a the result obtain be dominate by noise the green filter lead to the light reach the detector to be too dim even with the gain of the detector turn up to the maximum the background light and electrical fluctuation of the source cause the data to be inadequate the coherence length obtain from the interferograms can then be use in equation 1 to find the spectral width of the different source the coherence length be give below white lead − 5.6 × 10 −6 m white tungsten − 9.8 × 10 −6 m blue lead − 1.5 × 10 −5 m white tungsten with yellow filter − 3.4 × 10 −5 m. after use these coherence length in equation 1 the spectral width be calculate a such white lead − 8.5 × 10 12 hz white tungsten − 4.9 × 10 12 hz blue lead − 3.2 × 10 12 m white tungsten with yellow filter − 1.4 × 10 12 m. the white light source have a great spectral width than the single colour this be expect since white light be compose of several different frequency within the visible spectrum look up literature value for blue and yellow light show that the spectral width that have be calculate be not great than the range for those colour blue light have a frequency interval of approximately 610 -670 thz and yellow light have a frequency interval of approximately 510 -540 thz 5 the value for the spectral width of both colour that have be experimentally obtain be small than the frequency interval there be a lack of error analysis due to a lack of time the error and uncertainty will arise from several factor the precision of the measurement of the stage movement by the computer the noise present in the interferogram particularly for dimmer light source and the measurement of the coherence length will be source for error,extended,the
108,2ndINT_VEJ488_Redacted,michelson interferometer have be use a a fourier transform spectrometer ft to measure partial atomic spectrum of tungsten and mercury and the spectrum of both white and blue light-emitting diode lead this method of interferometry be show to be useful a a mean of investigate the profile of such spectrum both qualitatively and in detail for precise measurement of for example spectral line and blackbody radiation interferometry have be a standard technique in experimental physic since the introduction of the method in the late 19th century initially gain fame for it application to the michelson-morley experiment 1 and recently in the experimental verification of the existence of gravitational wave by the ligo collaboration 2 interferometry have be use to investigate a wide variety of physical phenomenon this experiment applies these technique with a michelson interferometer to investigate the spectrum of various source electromagnetic radiation primarily within the visible part of the spectrum the underlie principle of the interferometer be in the interference property of light a coherent beam of light carry a phase at each point the evolution of which be determine by the wavelength or equivalently the frequency of the light beam if this beam be pas through a beam-splitter to form two beam and later recombine such that the two beam have traverse different distance then there will be a phase shift between them this phase shift cause interference of the two recombine beam which may be constructive or destructive and be dependent on the difference in path length of the two beam upon recombine measure sample of the intensity of the recombine beam for a sufficient range of difference in path length allows for the frequency profile of the initial beam to be determine use fourier analysis 4 this may be apply to initial beam of light from source with characteristic spectrum where the profile of such spectrum be to be determine this experiment u this method to measure the spectrum of a source with a tungsten filament the spectrum of a mercury lamp and the spectrum of both white and blue light-emitting diode lead the interferometer relies on the interference of light beam a a result of the difference between their phase consider an initial beam of light an electromagnetic wave e 1 with wavenumber k characterise by the monochromatic profile where x be the distance from the source time dependence be neglect without loss of generality let this beam be pas through a basic interferometer a in figure 1 the movable mirror extends the left arm of the interferometer by distance ∆x relative to the other arm such that the two arm be of equal length when ∆x 0. a will be use in the configuration of this experiment in section iii the beam splitter also cause a far phase change in one of the beam of π radian therefore the recombine beam e 2 at the detector will be of the form where the total path length difference between the two beam be 2∆x and the path length from the source to the detector of the light that be reflect off the fix mirror be give by d. therefore the intensity of the light a measure by the detector give by |e 2 2 will be the intensity of the initial beam be constant whereas the intensity of this measure signal varies sinusoidally have be pas through the the interferometer this be a result of the interference of the two recombine beam due to their acquire phase difference from their different path length for example in this monochromatic case the beam will alternate from interfere constructively to destructively a the path difference 2∆x change by integer multiple of π k this detect signal will be of zero intensity when the path length be the same ∆x 0 due to the phase shift of π radian at the beam splitter and a such this position where the length of the arm of the interferometer be the same be call the null point the other feature to notice be that the intensity of the measure signal a see a a function of ∆x have an effective wavenumber in ∆x of 2k twice the wavenumber in x of k of the initial beam in this way measure the intensity |e 2 2 over a sufficiently large range of ∆x allows for the wavenumber k of the initial beam to be determine that example for an idealise monochromatic source may be extend for source with more detailed frequency profile an initial beam with wavenumber density g k will be give by and in the same way a for equation 2 the recombine beam with a path length difference of 2∆x will be of the form in this case the intensity profile may be more detailed and the measure signal require fourier analysis in order to determine the original power spectrum |g k 2 the intensity data be sample discretely over a finite domain in ∆x rather than continuously over an infinite domain in these idealise example therefore analysis of the measure data require the use of a discrete fourier transform in order to best approximate the spectrum of the initial beam 5 a schematic of the configuration of the apparatus use in the experiment be give in figure 2. the core function of the interferometer come from the two mirror and the beam splitter light from the source be first pas through a ground glass diffuser and enters the beam splitter the beam splitter have a partially-silvered surface on one face and dielectric plate 6 on the other the beam incident on the beam splitter be partially transmit towards the fix mirror and partially reflect towards the mirror mount on a move stage the move stage may be control remotely and operates such that it may be give a position with a range of ±12mm to move to and a speed at which to move to it for the speed use in data collection for this experiment the motion of the stage be smooth to a good approximation the two split beam be reflect off the mirror and recombine at the beam splitter where the beam return from the movable mirror be partially transmit and the beam return from the fix mirror be partially reflect the beam return from the fix mirror gain an extra phase of pi radian in total upon recombine due to the dielectric plate 6 the recombine beam be then incident on an aperture on the surface of the detector face the beam splitter which digitally record the intensity of the beam at a rate of 50hz measure in arbitrary unit the component of the apparatus be mount on an optical bench and clamped this be do in order to minimise the effect on their alignment of adjust individual component and for example replace source or lens the apparatus be also contain in a close box mount on rubber stabilise support the support aim to minimise the effect of external vibration and disturbance from the lab on the apparatus a the alignment of the beam be otherwise very sensitive to disturbance the box be close so that minimal external light may enter the apparatus potentially contribute to background noise measure by the detector which may otherwise mask the signal of the beam or interfere with the beam itself similarly large dark shield be place around the beam splitter to ensure that the beam follow primarily the path a marked in red in figure 2 and do not impinge on area outside of this that may affect the signal at the detector the alignment of the apparatus be essential to the operation of the interferometer the process use here of align the apparatus be to first align the beam splitter with the move stage such that they be parallel this be do use a green test laser a the source with the beam splitter exit towards the fix mirror block off and a test surface in place of the detector to obtain a visual aid to the alignment subsequently the fix mirror be align by the same method the fix mirror be fit such that fine adjustment may be make to it orientation when fix in place the beam be allow to recombine again and with a 25mm plano-convex lens fit to the green test laser source in order to achieve a narrow beam for far alignment the orientation of the fix mirror be adjust until radial haidinger fringe 7 be observe and centre on the test surface the null point may be found with align apparatus at which the length of the two arm of the interferometer be equal this point be measure to have zero intensity the interference be destructive for all wavelength due to the phase change associate with the dielectric plat on one side of the beam splitter this be found use the white lead source with the 25mm plano-convex lens attach in order to narrow the beam a the point across which the detector measure the intensity to show oscillation over a small range of micrometer and to grow large this be do by observe interferograms take with the detector a the move stage translates the movable mirror towards or away from the detector at know position with the apparatus correctly align interferograms may be take with the detector of the intensity profile of the source around the null point from which discrete fourier analysis may be use to infer information about the spectrum of the source the interferogram around the null point for the unfiltered white lead source be give in figure 3. the intensity scale be in arbitrary unit and the distance variable be the displacement of the move stage from the centre of it axis the null point be not centre at a displacement of zero due to the distance of the unmoved stage from the beam splitter be slightly different to that of the fix mirror this do not affect the fourier decomposition of the power spectrum the slight asymmetry in this interferogram suggests that the apparatus be slightly misalign during data collection data set collect prior to this displayed even great asymmetry which be reduce through adjust the system alignment it be notice that there be also a slight vertical misalignment which may have cause this however due to the vertically fix nature of the component this could not be correct the spectrum of this data set may be calculate by discrete fourier transform in this case use the fourier tool built into mathematica a detailed in the documentation 8 and be show in figure 4. this spectrum show to peak a narrow peak of short wavelength centre around 436nm and a wider peak centre around 550nm with large spread this show that the white lead be not a perfect white spectrum over the visible range but be construct a a blue lead in a phosphor case the measure spectrum of the blue lead be show for comparison in figure 4 to highlight that this peak corresponds to blue wavelength the case absorbs some of the blue light the shorter wavelength peak and re-emits it over a wider spectral band with low energy the profile of this re-emitted light be similar to a black-body spectrum the interferogram of the blue lead be show in figure 5. the blue lead interferogram appear to be very symmetric about the null point and feature a gaussian envelope to a good approximation this be indicative that the profile of the peak around blue wavelength in the blue lead spectrum should also be gaussian this spectrum be show overlaid in figure 4. the interferogram around the null point for the unfiltered tungsten filament source be give in figure 5. the tungsten interferogram show a narrower pulse than for example the blue lead pulse the constituent wavelength also appear to be on average longer these suggest a broader spectrum centre around longer wavelength a show by the calculate spectrum in figure 7. this spectrum appear to cover a wide portion of the visible spectrum centre around the longer orange and red wavelength this suggests that the tungsten filament source emits light with a black-body spectrum a be recognisable in the data however for a black-body radiator the spectrum seem to drop off too rapidly at longer wavelength this be likely not due to the tungsten a the detector use be sensitive only to wavelength within a gaussian envelope over the visible part of the spectrum and so the contribution to the spectrum of the longer wavelength may not have be detect assume that this be a black-body spectrum then the peak a measure be at 772 ± 5nm which implies that the temperature of the tungsten filament be close to 3.8 × 10 3 k by wien 's displacement law this be past the melt point of tungsten and give the tungsten filament do not melt we conclude that the longer wavelength part of the tungsten spectrum be suppress by the limited wavelength range of the detector the interferogram of a mercury lamp be also measure a show in figure 8. the spectrum of this mercury intensity profile be give in figure 9. this spectrum feature many peak although it be difficult to conclude with any certainty if these be physical or a product of noise or random fluctuation in order to explore this spectrum with more detail the mercury source be place behind a yellow filter in order to obtain data for just a small yellow-centred portion of the spectrum the measure intensity profile with the yellow filter be give in figure 10. the yellow-filtered mercury interferogram show significant a significant beating effect envelop by a gaussian profile which be strongly indicative of a yellow doublet -two spectral line in the yellow part of the visible spectrum which be close together the fourier decomposition of this data be give in figure 11. whilst the interferogram appear to be well align and without much noise the spectrum found from it be difficult to interpret whilst there be peak visible none be clear enough to conclude to be peak of the mercury spectrum a each have very few data point at each this data set be reproduce in a second interferogram take of the yellowfiltered mercury source almost exactly suggest that there be little random behaviour a high resolution interferogram would be require to analyse this case far in order to resolve finer increment in the wavelength domain of the transform a great range of distance must be sample in the interferogram and at finer increment the profile of the yellow filter would also need to be know in order to ignore filter related effect in the spectrum this be beyond the limitation in time for this experiment interferometry be an invaluable technique in modern experimental physic this experiment use a michelson interferometer a a fourier transform spectrometer to take interferograms of light source by a tungsten filament a mercury lamp a white lead and a blue lead the discrete fourier transforms of these data set allow for region of these spectrum to be explore provide largely qualitative insight into their spectral profile this method may be extend far to perform measurement of these spectrum to high level of precision such a investigation of the mercury yellow doublet comparison have be make between the source and in the case of the white and blue lead their spectrum have provide information on the construction of the white lead this method have wide applicability and may be a powerful tool if extend beyond this experiment which have provide only an overview of the use of interferometry in spectroscopy,superficial,exp
109,2ndINT_BKZ271_Redacted,we analyse the spectrum of a tungsten-halogen lamp use a fourier-transform spectrometer the spectrometer record the intensity pattern from the interference of the radiation with itself it then performs a fourier transform on this pattern and reconstructs the radiation from the source we use this reconstruct spectrum to measure the peak emission wavelength for the lamp which we found be 825 ± 0.4nm the tungsten-halogen lamp can be treat a a black-body imply that the peak wavelength be related to the temperature of the body by wien 's displacement law the temperature of the body we calculate to be 3512 ± 2k a rtificial light through have year have undergone great change from candle oil lamp and coal fire in the 18th century to cfl bulb and lead lamp today however one thing that have remain constant be that any advancement in artificial light be a milestone in history the sudden popularisation of the electric bulb when thomas edison file his first patent in 1879 1 begin a great revolution in light incandescence be the phenomenon of an object emit light due to be heat to a high temperature this be first demonstrate by ebenezer kinnersley in 1763 with a wire 2 the first incandescent bulb be make use carbon filament held in evacuate case these lamp be not efficient a most of the energy be release a heat evacuate the inside also cause the formation of a black residue 3 on the inside of the bulb far reduce it efficiency this change with the advent of tungsten filament tungsten have the high melt and boil point amongst all metal make it the ideal candidate to use in an incandescent lamp michelson and morley first invent the interferometer in search of the `` ether `` 4 although the search be unsuccessful they have create an instrument that be use even today to make precise measurement e.g ligo detector the aim of this experiment be to investigate the spectrum of the tungsten lamp and to measure the operational temperature of the lamp a fourier-transform spectrometer ft be a michelson interferometer where one of the arm have variable length the advantage of use a ft instead of a regular spectrometer be that a the ft be align use a laser the measurement be more precise a second advantage could be that the measurement make by the ft use interference fringe whereas the regular spectrometer gather data on single frequency individually another advantage be that the intensity detect be much low in a regular spectrometer due to loss in reflection transmission and also the narrow slit use to let in light 5 the michelson interferometer invent by albert michelson be an instrument that u the phenomenon of interference of light wave to function in essence a a highly precise ruler fig1 be a representation of the setup use m 1 and m 2 be mirror that act a the end of the arm of the interferometer the beam splitter 7 be an instrument that split the incident light beam into two part it be make up of two prism join together by a dielectric coat on the hypotenuse of both prism this dielectric coat reflect 50 of the beam and transmits the other 50 a for it use in this experiment the beam be split and then recombine after each part be reflect from their respective mirror and interfere on recombination the interference be either constructive or destructive depend on the difference in the distance each beam travel the coat provide an additional phase difference π to the part reflect off it this cause dark fringe destructive interference to be see when there be zero path difference the interferometer cause two beam of light to interfere and produce fringe pattern that vary base on the phase difference between the two beam the manner of interference be determine by the difference in the length of the path the beam travel if this difference be an integer multiple of the wavelength nλ then the interference be constructive and a bright plane wave output be observe if the difference in path length be an integer multiple of half the wavelength n λ 2 no light be see at the output because of the way the mirror be set up there be two possible fringe pattern visible figure 2 and 3 show the two case the case in 2 have cylindrical symmetry both mirror be perpendicular to each other and so form circular fringe call haidinger fringe the case in 3 produce straight fringe know a fizeau fringe a the mirror be not align perpendicularly since these fringe would be form on the nanometre scale for a laser source lens be use in the setup refer to section on experimental method to enlarge the image lead and incandescent bulb be extend source and hence do n't require lens to achieve this consider the usage of a laser collimate beam source and move one of the mirror in order to scan the output this scan ought to show a certain spike in intensity at a particular point along the interferogram which be know a the 'null point it be the point the move mirror be at when the two arm of the interferometer be exactly equal in length the fourier transform be a mathematical tool that represent switch from position space to frequency space or viceversa when perform on a monochromatic single frequency wave it produce a single delta function in frequency space single delta function correspond to a series of bright and dark fringe however when a second frequency be add 2 delta function the intensity record be see to be modulate and beating be observe the interferometer can be use to scan the spectrum of a source and use a fourier transform to identify the different frequencies/wavelengths be use to produce the output hence a michelson interferometer with one move arm be know a a 'fourier transform spectrometer any body whose temperature great than absolute zero radiates energy in the form of thermal radiation the temperature of a body be related to the internal energy of that body i.e hotter body have high energy incandescent bulb be make use a thin metallic wire filament with a high electrical resistance this cause it to heat up like a resistor when current pas through the rise temperature cause an increase in the energy radiation but may also melt the filament tungsten have the high melt point 3695k among the metal and so be ideal for such usage the heating of the filament follow the joule heating effect 1 every light source have a characteristic emission spectrum base on it production and so a characteristic efficiency efficiency be thus the more efficient a source be the lesser it percentage emission of heat or infrared radiation incandescent source tend to emit large amount of heat and a a consequence reach very high temperature low efficiency incandescent bulb be fill with inert gas instead of a vacuum in order to lessen the heating of the case and the evaporation of the filament material every body with a temperature great than 0k emits radiation if this body be at thermal equilibrium 2 with it environment it be say to emit black-body radiation an incandescent light source when in thermal equilibrium be consider a black-body and it radiation have a characteristic spectrum and intensity accord to planck 's law black-body radiation follow a curve know a a planck distribution 9 this curve depends solely on the equilibrium temperature of the body and not on it shape size etc wien 's law defines the relationship between the peak wavelength the wavelength at which the lamp have the high intensity of emission and the temperature of the body 9 where t represent the temperature of the body and λ peak represent the peak wavelength of the black-body radiation spectrum the source use can be either a collimate light source or an extend source e.g lead but for the purpose of setup and alignment a laser collimate source be use in order to have the most accurate alignment possible accuracy be paramount in an interferometry setup a measurement be make on the scale of wavelength of light make them highly susceptible to error mirror m 1 be mount on a linear stage that be connect to a motor the motor move the stage back and forth across a 24mm range the detector record the intensity of the light a m 1 be move to vary the length of the arm the mirror use be small and although the lab be a `` dark lab `` a lens f 100mm be use at the source to focus the beam to a point this beam now split and a point image be see in m 1 this image be use to align the beam splitter perpendicular to m 1 such that the point be centre on m 1 an adjustable mirror m 2 be now introduce in the path of beam 2 and place perpendicular to the beam splitter align the point at the centre of m 2 ensures the overlap and hence interference of the beam on recombination a white card can be use a a screen to observe a clear image to fine-tune the alignment once align a second lens f 25.4mm be use to enlarge the image if both the mirror be set exactly perpendicular to each other the observe fringe will be haidinger fringe fig3 a the green laser be monochromatic the intensity profile would just be an infinite sine wave of a certain frequency this when put through a fourier-transform 10 produce a single narrow gaussian profile with the peak wavelength at approximately 523nm a the number of contribute wavelength get large the intensity variation begin to localise about the null point refer to appendix therefore to find the null point it be necessary to have interference from a white light source we use a white lead 11 for this and found the null point to be at x −7.01244mm on the coordinate system of the linear stage a the position of the null point only depends on the length of the arm of the interferometer it must have approximately the same position for any source of light that consists of multiple frequency the detector be connect to a computer that display the amplitude of the signal vary with the position of the linear stage m 1 a m 1 pas the null point a large spike in intensity be observe the amplitude exhibit a gaussian profile with the width dependent on the number of wavelength use to produce the incident spectrum fig4 show the position of the null point a observe use the tungsten lamp the lamp use be a thorlabs sls201l tungsten-halogen lamp that have a wavelength range 360nm − 2600nm a specify by the manufacturer the tungsten lamp without a filter act a a white light source meaning it be an extend light source compose of several frequency the lamp be connect to the setup via an optical fibre cable consider that the null point must be in the same position the intensity be record from −7.2mm to −6.8mm and a show in figure 4 the null point be found at x −7.01209mm assume there be no disturbance to the setup the change in it position result from non-uniform motion of the linear stage refer to error section of result once the null point be found the record data be put through a fast fourier transform fft in order to try and reconstruct the wavelength that the source be make up of fig5 show the plot of intensity against wavelength for the tungsten-halogen lamp a expect the spectrum be a continuous gaussian with the intensity peak at a certain wavelength black-body emission spectrum be characteristic of the temperature of the body and like the lamp star too can be described a black-bodies sunlight for example have the gaussian spectrum of a body with a peak wavelength approximately 540nm 3 in order to find the peak wavelength for the lamp we fit a gaussian function fig6 to fig5 where a be the amplitude x 0 the mean intensity σ the standard deviation and k an arbitrary offset constant we might expect a similar spectrum for tungsten due to it colour and it use a a lamp but in reality the tungsten lamp have a spectrum with a peak wavelength of approximately 825nm this mean it have a high contribution from infrared light and a low contribution of blue light a compare to sun and be what give an incandescent light source it characteristic yellow colour the error in the peak wavelength be calculate from the covariance of the fit parameter and be σ λ 0.4nm hence the peak wavelength be once we found the peak wavelength of the tungsten lamp we use wien 's law to calculate the temperature of the tungsten filament this come out to be the error in the temperature be calculate a follow iv result when take data number of sample to be record be one of the input a the detector sample at 50hz if the number input be not complete when the stage reach it destination it move a few nanometre back and forth and keep sample until either manually stop or the input condition be met another possibility be to set the number of sample base on the speed and scan range but the position of the null point still shift this could be due to the stage not cover a constant distance between two sample in principle the distance between consecutive sample be large or small than require so there be no constant value for the overshoot or undershoot of the stage the intensity of the tungsten lamp 's radiation must follow a planck disrtribution for a give wavelength but a observe in fig6 the intensity behaves approximately a a gaussian distribution this be cause by the detector have a fix range of sensitivity outside of which it do n't detect intensity this range be from 300nm to 1100nm with the peak sensitivity at 940nm a a result of this the wavelength from 1100nm to 2600nm be absent in the spectrum the operation temperature of the lamp a in the data sheet 12 be t rat 2796 k 7 fig7 show the true spectral power distribution of the lamp superimpose over that measure by the detector it be apparent from the fig7 that the true wavelength of maximum emission be outside the range of the detector thereby cause the difference ≈ 700k of the experimental result to the datasheet therefore the detector be a major source of systematic error in the experiment in conclusion we measure the temperature of the tungsten filament to be t f ilament 3512 ± 2k use the fouriertransform spectrometer the fourier transform itself be do use the scipy package on python a an incandescent lamp tungsten lamp be the most widely use a tungsten have the high melt point 3695k amongst all metal the measure temperature however be close to the melt point of tungsten meaning the filament must be evaporate rapidly even in the inert gas environment the result also translates to the filament be very fragile and near it break point however on accounting for the systematic error we observe that the lamp must be at a low temperature,extended,exp
110,2ndINT_DAR896_Redacted,in this report fourier transform spectroscopy be use to analyze different light source this be do by set up a michelson interferometer and take data of the interference pattern produce computational fourier analysis be then perform on the interferogram to get the spectral line of the light source result be obtain for lead source and a tungsten source the effect of light filter be also analyze appropriate gaussian approximation be take to calculate parameter of the line spectrum and interferograms such a coherence length and variance comparison can be make between the data obtain and simulated result to study source of error from this report consideration be make on how to reduce common source of error in interferometry the result of this report characterize certain light source well include a tungsten source however far refinement of the setup be require to well study more complex feature of light source the study of interferometry have be apply to multiple field of physic a well a be benefit from in industly today interferometly continue to be use in cut edge research and experiment famous example of this include ligo which detect gravitational wave and the 'failed michelson-morley aether experiment which played a role in special relativity l throughout the modem era interferometly have impact optical astronomy various interferometer have be use to observe celestial body both within and beyond our solar system for example single-aperture interferometly have be use to investigate the solar system image detail such a the stm and stmspots i see source i for a detailed summary of optical astronomy use interferometer research into other discipline of science have also benefit from interferomet iy due to the ability to study both macroscopic and microscopic system for instance living cell through microspectrofluorometry and fluorescent image be image use excitation and emission spect i•oscopy to do this a michelson interferometer be use a a fast fourier transfo1m spectrometer 2 see source 2 for more on this this repo1t will discus the investigation unde1taken on different light source which be inspect use a michelson interferometer use a a fast fourier t1•ansfo1m spectrometer the interferograms and spectral line obtain of these light source will be analyze such a compare with simulation source of enor from the study will then also be consider thus this repo1t will illust i•ate the essential consideration require when study interferomet iy and the general application common source of enor in interferometly such a alignment and vibration will also be evaluate within this report a similar setup to the one use in this report could be use to explore other light source hence the detector can measure an interference pattern when vary d. in this experiment m 1 be move a in fig 1 such that d varied the interference pattern interferogram detect due to this be then subject to fourier analysis to obtain the spectral line of the light source the rest of this report will cover more of the theoretical background involve the experimental method and analysis of data finally there will be a discussion on the quality of the experiment and the result obtain generally when two coherent wave superimpose with each other they produce an interference pattern consider two superimpose monochromatic wave v 1 r t and v 2 r t the interference pattern be give by where v r t be the superposition of the two wave the displacement of v r t varies from an amplitude great than the combine amplitude of v 1 and v 2 to zero depend on the phase of v 1 and v 2 at that point 1 if ψ 1 ψ 2 є ℂ be complex amplitude of v 1 and v 2 with phase θ 1 and θ 2 respectively then the intensity of the superimpose wave be where i 1 v 1 2 i 2 v 2 2 be the average intensity of v 1 and v 2 respectively and ½ ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ 1 ψ 2 corresponds to the amount of interference between the two wave 1 the interference term a see in 2 between the two wave be dependent on the phase of v 1 and v 2 where δx be the path difference between the two wave and λ be the wavelength in a vacuum 1 a more thorough discussion on interference and treatment of wave can be found in source 1 in a michelson interferometer the two superimpose wave can be consider a monochromatic thus they produce an interference pattern which be only a function of path difference this interference pattern be described by the follow equation where t be the path difference travel by the two wave θ be the angle of incidence and m be the order of interference from fig 1 t =│d -d'│ when m be an integer the two wave be in phase thus constructively interfere result in a maximum the separation between maximum be constant and equal to λ/2 the wavelength of light emit by a light source be described by a spectral line which plot the intensity of light a a function of wavelength the spectrum intensity i λ of a source be give by where i j λ be a component of the spectral line due to a wavelength λ j and δi be noise i j λ be often model a a well-defined function such a a gaussian or lorentzian base on the light source 3 source 3 discus how equation 5 can be numerically analyze through take derivative to estimate parameter such a n. the distribution of intensity for a gaussian spectral line follow the follow function where a j be the amplitude of the distribution λ j be the wavelength at a j and σ j 2 be the variance of the distribution σ j 2 be related to 1/2 fwhm κ j a source 3 detail how the value of a j and σ j can be estimate through the method of take derivative however due to noise δi the estimate for these value do have significant error 3 experimentally spectral line distribution be generate through inverse fourier transforms of an interferogram which be the interference pattern observe by a michelson interferometer ideally the interferogram f x will be define by the follow where f be the frequency x be the path difference s f be the spectral distribution and φ be the phase error of the experiment 4 φ be a variable that depends on how the frequency and path difference be control φ can thus be separate into it cause where g f be a function of the frequency and h x f be a function of path difference and frequency path dependent phase error include alignment error affected by path difference whilst frequency dependent phase error could include electronic signal property 4 source 4 discus the treatment of phase error and common cause of them in more detail the coherence length of a light source in a michelson interferometer be analogous to the path difference the two wave can have before the interferogram can no longer distinguish noise from interference the coherence length of a source can be calculate from the spectral line a follow where l be the coherence length for a gaussian spectral line 5 figure 2. this figure show a simulation of the gaussian spectral line which would be expect for a light source of mean wavelength 500nm and standard deviation of 40nm this represent the parameter of λ j and σ j respectively a in equation 6 an arbitrary amplitude be plot against the wavelength of the light source the program use to simulate this take multiple delta function for the wavelength of the source whose arbitrary amplitude have be limited appropriately refer to fig 2 equation 6 show that if σ j be reduce the broadness of the spectral line would decrease seem more like a single wavelength of light be emit from the source a a result the interferogram in fig 3 would become broader a σ j decrease this can be see from equation 10 because the coherence length increase for the light source when the two mean wavelength in fig 4 become sufficiently similar for an appropriate standard deviation beating effect occur in the interferogram the general gaussian envelope remains in this case the setup use in this experiment be identical to that show in fig 1. a thor lab ccm1-bs013/m beam due to the dielect11c plate this be align with a thor lab kml 00 miirnr by eye of where the reflect beam hit the beam splitter this mirror be connect to a motor which meant that the miirnr have a range of motion of 25mm perpendicular to the incident beam thus this mirror represent mt in fig i. this process be repeat for another identical mirror use conti•ols to tilt the miirnr into alignment due to the range of motion of the move miirnr this mirror have to be position such that both miirnrs could be equidistant from the beam splitter this be necessa1y because the interferograms of the light source under investigation have a coherence length of a few micrometer so the null point where d d have to exist within the range of movement a thor lab convex lens with a 25.4mm focal length be attach to the beam splitter such that incident light from the light source would diverge and expand hence the superimpose beam which be project onto d in fig i would produce an enlarge image this make it easy to refine the alignment and to see an interference pattern a green laser be use to align this setup in fig i a a green laser be coherent so it do n't diverge this make alignment easy also the specti•al line of a laser be relatively na1rnw almost like a delta function so the coherence length of the inte1ferogram be more than a few cm hence an interference pattern be see throughout the 25mm range of motion of mt a photodetector be then place in position d of fig i which be connect to a computer the photodetector sample a signal at a rate of 50hz to acquire interferograms of light source with a coherence length of the order of micrometer the null point have to be found to a high precision of roughly 10 order of interference since visible light have a wavelength of the order of 10-1 this be found by move mt across it range of motion when the miirnr move too fa t vibration of the motor cause no interference pattern to be see thus the speed of the miirnr be set to no more than 0.005 mm/s from equation 4 a the miirnr move towards the null point the path difference and the order of interference would reduce for a give 0 to exploit this a haidinger fonge pattern be produce obse1vationally this meant that the ring of the interference pattern would collapse into the center when move towards the null point when the ring of the interference pattern begin to expand the miirnr have past the null point through this method the null point be found to an accuracy of 5x 10-6 m. when investigate other light source the convex lens be remove a they be extend source which be much weaker than the laser by the nyquist theorem the sample rate be set to take roughly 10 sample per oscillation when at a speed of o.ool mm/s thus enough information about the interference pattern be obtain for data analysis 5000 sample be take within the range scan at this speed the rate of sample do vary by ± 2 sample per oscillation to the near integer which be evaluate by take measurement of many cycle for repeat experiment this systematic e1rnr would have no bearing on find the specti•al line or do data analysis because of the nyquist theorem od d figure 6. this figure illustrates the effect of an alignment error on a beam which be offset by an angle 0 from perfect alignment from fig l the beam travel to the move mirror m1 be misalign from the desire path by an angle of the order of 10-3 c_ this show that when the mirror move by a small displacement od the change in path length of the beam be 2oh co 0. because of this when the interferogram graph be plot for position of the mirror against signal strength the detect signal have be stretch by a factor of co 0 relative to actual change in path length this be also true for the spectral line graph a mention in fig 2 during the alignment of the interferometer use the green laser there be a misalignment between the beam splitter and the move mirror m t. this misalignment result in a systematic error of the interferogram and spectral line graph to reduce this systematic error the distance d a in fig i between the beam splitter and mt be make a big a possible this reduce the angle of misalignment however reduce the error through well alignment be limited to human precision from this error the null point be not actually when d d but when d be roughly 3 wavelength less than d from calculation estimate however this systematic error of the position of the null point would only translate the interferogram graph which be eliminate when inverse fom'ier ti•ansfonning to get specti•al line furthe1more it be found that the stretch factor of co 0 a discus in fig 2 would be too insignificant to affect the data analysis of graph this be because the resolution of the distance move by m 1 a well a the wavelength of the light source be too large to measure such a small change due to alignment this be support far by take a small angle approximation such that the stretch factor of co θ can be approximate to 1  investigate light source white and blue lead source a well a a tungsten source be investigate use this method of fourier transform spectroscopy filter be also use to investigate what effect the spectral width of the filter would have on the spectral line a range of 0.1mm around the null point be scan at a speed of 0.001mm/s a mention in the method 5000 sample be take to cover this range take 10 ± 2 sample per oscillation the photodetector connect to a computer take data for the interferogram of the light source computational analysis use the scipy.fftpack package then perform fast fourier transforms to obtain the spectral line of the light source figure 8. this figure show the spectral line obtain for the blue lead through computational analysis and fast fourier transforms a in fig 2 amplitude against wavelength be plot an approximate gaussian spectral line can be see with a peak amplitude at roughly 450nm which be within the range of blue wavelength figure 9. this figure show the spectral line of a tungsten source which will be approximate to be gaussian the peak amplitude be see at a wavelength of 900nm which be within the range of roughly 300-1000nm assume the blue lead spectral line be gaussian the coherence length be estimate use equation 10 and equation 7 the value of λ blue be estimate to be 4.51 ± 0.01 × 10 -7 m and σ blue be estimate to be 0.11 ± 0.01 × 10 -7 m use notation from equation 6 from equation 10 add fractional error in quadrature the coherence length be estimate a 2.9 ± 0.2 × 10 -6 m. the same assumption be make for the spectral line of tungsten the value of λ tungsten be 8.80 ± 0.20 × 10 -7 m and σ tungsten be 1.34 ± 0.07 × 10 -7 m. use the same data analysis the coherence length be 9.2 ± 0.5 × 10 -7 m. the coherence length for a tungsten lamp be small than that of the blue lead because the spread of the spectral line for tungsten be broader thus the interferogram for the tungsten lamp be narrower a predict by equation 10 when put a yellow and green filter in front of the tungsten lamp the spectral line be n't smooth and have multiple maximum and minimum in amplitude the peak amplitude of the spectral line be at roughly 535nm for the green filter and 605nm for the yellow filter this happen due to the spectral width of the filter passing through a range of wavelength within the bandwidth of those filter the lack of smoothness may have be due to interaction with the filter such a absorption effect a white lead be also investigate the spectral line for this be also not smooth however have 4 distinct peak amplitude these occur at wavelength of roughly 700nm 625nm 550nm and 475nm this be likely because white lead source be usually construct out of mainly red blue and green wavelength of light the most significant random error propagate themselves into the data a noise vibration such a write on the table and the motor be one of these random error a thor lab nexus optical table be use to set the experiment up on this contribute to reduce vibration and keep the alignment relatively fix during the experiment we also limited movement during the experiment a much a possible include not write on the same desk a the setup the photodetector be a photodiode attach to an amplifier with variable gain hence the gain level for each experiment be set to the high to reduce noise environmental factor also contribute to the noise for example other source of light effect the setup be contributor to random error to reduce background light level the setup be contain within a matte black box internally the setup be also conduct in a dark room the contain box be also make of plastic and be reflective on the outside this would reduce temperature variation a heat conduction and radiation transfer be both reduce this be another source of random error a temperature change would affect the intensity spectrum of wavelength emit a well a thermal expansion of the equipment affect alignment hence the light source be only turn on during the experiment to reduce internal heating of the light source from the interferograms these consideration reduce the effect of random error to a level of 5 of the signal amplitude the aim of this experiment be to investigate the characteristic of different light source when under the investigation of fourier transform spectroscopy this be do by set up a michelson interferometer which be accurately align and setup many systematic error associate with the experiment such a alignment be significantly reduce or evaluate this be achieve due to the accurate equipment use and the careful consideration make during the experimental method source of random error be also reduce to an estimate 5 of maximum amplitude of the signal a mention in the method and quantify by equation 5 and 9 the source of random error introduce themselves into the data a mostly background noise such source include environmental factor vibration and electronic noise the fourier transform spectrometer integrate a computer to record data computational method and analysis be then use to obtain interferograms and spectral line this be do for different source of light under experimental investigation this experiment could successfully analyze the characteristic of some light source the spectral line of these light source could be approximate to function such a gaussians this make data analysis possible and parameter of the spectral line and interferograms able to be determine such a standard deviation and coherence length however the experimental method and setup have not be refine enough to analyze more complex source of light this include the green laser use to align the setup which experienced large fluctuation in line spectrum due to significant random error such a temperature variation also the tungsten light with filter and the white light spectrum be not very smooth under this experiment to improve this method of characterize the different light source the data take around the null point should have be confine to roughly 10 micrometer rather than the 0.1mm range of data which be use this would reduce the noise effect which would enter the interferogram and spectral line graph thus if part of the noise have a frequency dependence such a electronic noise or vibration then this effect would be reduce also any beating effect which occur outside of the gaussian interferogram would have less of an impact on the spectral line,superficial,bal
111,2ndINT_KUY555_Redacted,we use a michelson interferometer to conduct a spectral analysis of light source use a fourier transform method for the monochromatic laser diode the interferogram be use to directly calculate the wavelength a λ 530 ± 50 nm a similar analysis be apply to a white lead source whereby the fourier transform method produce a wavelength spectrum with two peak correspond to λ 460 ± 3 nm and λ 580 ± 8 nm an adjustment due to the photodiode sensitivity be apply and the result wavelength spectrum closely match the expect spectrum for the white lead i nterferometry be a powerful technique in which a beam of light be split and then superimpose with a phase difference to produce an interference pattern the pattern can be analyse to deduce the property of light i.e wavelength in the initial beam interferometry have be responsible for fundamental scientific breakthrough such a disprove the luminiferous aether theory with the michelson-morley experiment 1 and the discovery of gravitational wave with sensitive laser interferometer 2 the technique be also use with spectroscopy to analyse the composition of light wave from unknown source this method be prefer over spectroscopy with diffraction grate because the property of all wavelength of light be encode within the interferogram a fourier transform technique be use to decompose the interferogram into the frequency of light which produce the observe interference pattern we aim to use a fourier transform method with a michelson interferometer to conduct spectral analysis of the light emit by different source the technique can be extend to analyse emission spectrum of other atom similarly analysis of the solar spectrum can be use to resolve the element present in the photosphere a michelson interferometer fig 1 involves the use of a beam-splitter to divide a ray of light into two orthogonal ray one ray be direct towards a fix mirror while the other travel towards a mirror on a stage whose movement be control by powerful magnet the ray be reflect by the mirror to the beam-splitter where they be recombine use the superposition principle and direct towards the photodetector consider monochromatic light of wave vector k and amplitude 2a k incident on the beam-splitter if the mirror be align at the zero path difference point zpd the ray will fig 1 a michelson interferometer split a beam of light into two orthogonal ray one ray be reflect by a fix mirror while the other ray be reflect by a mirror on a move stage the beam be recombine at the beam-splitter and direct to the photodetector 3 constructively interfere then if the mirror be move a distance δx the path difference be 2δx and the recombine wave be ψ a k e i kx−ωt e i kx+2kδx−ωt the resultant intensity at the photodetector can be write a where this expression consists of a constant term i k and an oscillatory term i k co 2kδx if the light source consists of light of vary wave vector k 2πσ where σ be the wavenumber then the resultant intensity at each path difference i δx be an integral over the intensity of each of these wavenumbers 4 which can be write a the fourier cosine transform of i σ see appendix a hence the intensity a a function of path difference i δx be a fourier transform pair of the intensity a a function of wavenumber i σ then by measure the intensity with respect to path difference the intensity with respect to wavenumber can be deduce by take a fourier transform of the interferogram in our experiment we use a magnet-controlled stage to accurately move the mirror and measure the intensity of the resultant beam use an osram sfh 2200 photodiode fig 2 the beam-splitter be align perpendicular to the mirror by verify a single point be visible on the screen in a an incorrectly tilt mirror produce two spot in b a correctly tilt mirror produce a single spot 3 detector the alignment of the apparatus be conduct use a thorlabs collimate laser diode the motorise mirror be reset to it centre position and the beam-splitter be align perpendicular to the normal of the mirror by ensure the reflect beam produce a single point see fig 2 similarly the stage be move through it complete range to verify that there be no vertical tilt in the mirror or beam-splitter the distance from the beam-splitter to the mirror be measure and the fix mirror be position at the same distance exactly opposite the beam-splitter see fig 1 each mirror be individually align accord to the above procedure once the mirror be align a lens be use to enlarge the point on the screen and observe the fizeau interference pattern by vary the tilt of the fix mirror the angle of the mirror be fine-tuned until circular fringe haidinger fringe be observe indicate the tilt alignment be such that circular symmetry be achieve 5 after alignment be complete the laser be replace by a white lead which have a coherence length of 10 µm 5 give that the detector operates at 50 hz the maximum distance that the stage can move per second to detect the interference peak at zpd be approximately where ∆l c be the coherence length and d ≤ 0.1 mm for the white lead to ensure the peak be capture the initial scan be take at v 0.025 mm s −1 within a range of −5 mm to 5 mm which be sufficient to find the zpd we use a computer model to simulate the interferograms we expect to collect firstly for a source with a wavelength of λ 550 nm and line width ∆λ 0.01 nm the observe intensity against path difference be plot in fig 3. note that the wavelength of the plot in fig 3 b be λ 550 ± 10 nm which corresponds to the simulated wavelength similar analysis can be extend to a source of white light which will contain multiple wavelength of visible light we can simulate this a a source with wavelength λ 550 nm and a spectral width of ∆λ 150 nm the plot of intensity against path difference be show in fig 4. we use the green collimate laser diode to produce an interferogram a show in fig 5. the interferogram be conduct over a short range so the modulate gaussian shape be not completely developed and therefore the width of the envelope can not be calculate however the individual cosine oscillation can be resolve if the axis be scale appropriately fig 5 b note that this be a plot of intensity against the fig 4 a plot of the intensity in arbitrary unit against path difference for white light show a cosinusoid function which be modulate by a gaussian of width σ 0.38 ± 0.08 µm position of the mirror x rather than the path difference δx so we account for the factor of two in the fourier transform analysis when the fourier transform of fig 5 be take and the unit be convert from wavenumber to wavelength a plot of amplitude in arbitrary unit against wavelength be produce in fig 6. this appear to show an almost rectangular function in the range 500 nm to 575 nm with some strong noise the shape of the modulate gaussian be not clear so the fourier transform be not able to deduce the width of the correspond gaussian pair in wavenumber space the standard approach would be to take a long interferogram to resolve the width of the modulate gaussian but since the light from the laser be monochromatic it be possible to deduce the wavelength directly from the interferogram a with the simulated data in fig 3. to determine the wavelength of the sinusoid in the interferogram we take an average of the separation between peak the interferogram be noisy and some data point be cluster due to instability in the move stage so analyse this data directly cause some point to be incorrectly identify a peak which can skew the result instead we calculate a linear move average of the data in a fix window of five data point this smooth the curve and behaves a a noise filter we can verify that apply the filter have improve the quality of the data by consider the histogram of the distance the mirror must move between peak in fig 7. note that the wavelength be twice the distance move by the mirror between peak thus use the filter interferogram we calculate the wavelength of the light source a λ 530 ± 50 nm the expect value from the data sheet be λ 532.0 ± 0.6 nm 7 there be a large error in the calculate wavelength due to the spread in the value for peak separation which arises from inaccuracy in the move stage we repeat the step for the white lead source produce a wide interferogram about the zpd see fig 8 unlike the fig 5 a plot of the intensity in arbitrary unit against position of the mirror in millimetre for a green laser show a an interferogram which we anticipate would take the shape of a modulate gaussian if the range of the mirror be extend in b the axis be scale to show the individual sinusoid that compose the interferogram fig 6 the laser interferogram be fourier transform to wavenumber space and then the axis be scale to produce an amplitude against wavelength plot the plot appear to show a rectangular function between from 500 nm to 575 nm with noise in the centre which be likely due to the shape of the gaussian not develop in the correspond interferogram simulated interferogram in fig 4 the actual interferogram have many more oscillation this indicates that the white lead do not output a symmetric gaussian distribution of wavelength a assume in the simulation the asymmetry in the interferogram be an indication that there be some misalignment of apparatus but the general shape of the interferogram be unaffected in fig 9 we fourier transform the interferogram to wavenumber space and scale the axis to produce a graph of amplitude in arbitrary unit against wavelength the plot show two distinct gaussians overlap a gaussian with mean µ 460 ± 3 nm and standard deviation σ 10 ± 5 nm and another gaussian with mean µ 580 ± 8 nm and standard deviation σ 60 ± 10 nm one critical source of error in the experiment be the sensitivity of the photodiode detector to certain wavelength of light from the technical datasheet the photodiode be most suit to detect wavelength in the region 800 nm to 1000 nm see fig 10 for a give λ in nanometre we can model the fig 8 a plot of intensity in arbitrary unit against the distance move by the mirror produce an interferogram which appear to show cosinusoid function modulate by some decay function note that the left side of the interferogram appear to be asymmetrical but the general shape of the interferogram should provide sufficient information for fourier analysis fig 9 a fourier transform of the white lead interferogram can be use to resolve the wavelength in this light source the lead contains two distinct gaussian function the gaussian at λ 460 ± 3 nm be approximately 80 of the amplitude of the gaussian at λ 580 ± 8 nm which be significantly wider sensitivity of the photodiode use a piecewise linear function then we divide the amplitude of the observe wavelength in fig 9 by the correspond relative sensitivity of the photodiode for each give wavelength the result be a plot of the adjust amplitude of each wavelength in the interferogram a show in fig 11 a note that this be almost identical to the resultant wavelength characteristic graph show with the black line in fig 11 b fig 10 the relative sensitivity of the photodiode a a function of the wavelength of incident light the photodiode be optimise for detect wavelength in the range 800 nm to 1000 nm so be not ideal for analysis of visible spectrum 8 a persistent source of error in this experiment be the motorise stage there be a systematic error in the way that the motorise stage move when specify to move at a constant velocity if the velocity be too low the stage do not move linearly but instead jumped between position and then cluster it data point until it move onto the next position this be apparent when the interferogram be analyse at a high resolution a fig 12. there be also a random error in the value measure a the current position by the stage a histogram of the distance move by the stage between measurement reveals that in the above case the stage move an average distance of ∆x 1.7 nm per sample but with a standard deviation of σ 117 nm with oscillation a far backwards a ∆x 160 nm between measurement the combine random and systematic error in the movement of the stage contributes the large error in the measure interferograms and hence in the observe wavelength the inadequacy of the photodetector in detect visible light have already be discus but the correspond effect have not be explore the sensitivity of the photodiode increase proportionally to λ for the range 400 nm to 920 nm fig 11 in a the adjust amplitude for each wavelength show that the wavelength correspond to blue light be the most prevalent in the white lead follow by a wider mix of wavelength in the 500 nm to 650 nm range in b a white lead operating at temperature 25 • c consists of four gaussian peak with light emission at 470 ± 4 nm 500 ± 4 nm 550 ± 4 nm and 633 ± 4 nm correspond to blue cyan green and red respectively the resultant characteristic show in black have peak emission around λ 442 ± 4 nm and a small peak at λ 529 ± 4 nm 8 thus if a light source have a characteristic emission spectrum such that the amplitude of light emit decrease a ∝ λ −1 in the same range then the combine effect can result in the photodiode detect an interferogram which be the fourier transform of a rectangular function i.e a sinc function it 's possible that this effect contributes to the modulate envelope in fig 8. a photodiode which be exclusively sensitive to wavelength in the visible spectrum would be more suitable for this experiment we have use the michelson interferometer with a fourier transform technique to conduct a spectral analysis of light from different source use simulated interferograms we fig 12 the movement of the stage be not linear so the sample point be not linearly space and can be cluster between some measurement the stage appear to move in the wrong direction the error bar represent an error of ∆x ±10 nm equivalent to 5 time the average distance move per sample a move average filter be apply to this data in fig 7 to reduce the effect of the stage instability predict a monochromatic source would produce a cosinusoidal function modulate by a wide gaussian envelope while a white light source would yield a cosinusoid modulate by a narrow gaussian we measure the wavelength of the green laser directly from the interferogram a λ 530 ± 50 nm which include the expect value of λ 532.0 ± 0.6 nm a fourier transform method could not be use directly on the interferogram a the shape of the modulate gaussian be not developed on the small range use spectral analysis of a white lead show two distinct wavelength peak at λ 460 ± 3 nm and λ 580 ± 8 nm the characteristic wavelength spectrum closely match the expect spectrum from the technical data-sheet once the photodiode adjustment be apply the fourier cosine transform of a function f x be define a 6 the equation we have derive in 3 be this can be write a the first integral yield a constant say i 0 while the second integral can be simplify by first note that i σ be not define for σ ≤ 0 so suppose i σ i −σ then the integrand of the second integral be even and we may write now use the substitution σ κ/2 which give dσ dκ/2 and the integral becomes a require hence i δx and i σ be

112,2ndINT_GOO868_Redacted,"this report will look into a interferometry experiment that we conduct over a 3 week period in order to observe and measure numerous light source wavelength a a result this be a display of the measurement that we take of a white lead blue lead and a white tungsten that have either a green or yellow filter attach to it from this we be able to collect all their respective wavelength by use a fast fourier transformation on the interferogram numerous characteristic of each source could be found a well a the inefficiency within the system the wavelength of these source and their associate error can be found within the data analysis and error calculation section interferometry be the usage of electromagnetic wave in order to allow for a system to produce an interference pattern that will allow for small displacement to be measure a well a for the study of a material 's property the experiment that we be conduct look into both of these area for the experiment that we be able to complete we be able to take an interferogram of our source and through fourier analysis we be able to find the individual wavelength of the source often best show through a gausssian distribution in addition these gaussians also allow for data to be collect about the information of the system and it imperfection this setup that we be able to use through the usage of both qualitative and quantitative data allow measurement into the wavelength of the source spectral width step size and coherence length each of which explain in the follow section the setup that we will consider be the same configuration a the michelson interferometer 1 and can be see in figure 1. from this figure it 's able to show the principal setup and the influence of misalignment if the setup be to be correctly align the two mirror should produce haidinger fringe and hence interference that produce a circular pattern if incorrectly align the system will produce fizeau horizontal fringe both of these case be a result of interference from the two image produce by the mirror after the beam-splitter separate the source 's signal the interference within the system allows for information to be record however the point which be of most concern for our experiment be the null point in order to define the null point first consider figure 2 show the path a ray would take when incident on the two mirror and how the two image from the mirror overlay one another 1. this be a diagram of the michelson interferometer setup the same setup we use for our experiment and with a move mirror 2 on a table drive by a motor 2 the use of figure 2 can allow the triangle abc to be consider a a result of this triangle the equation for the relation between separation of the mirror t and the wavelength of the source λ can be found where θ the angle between the normal of the mirror and the ray and m be the order of the wavelength that allow for this particular separation and angle this equation aid in the definition of the null point and this be where t=0 the null point qualitatively however when observe be through the movement of the fringe on either side of the null point the circular fringe move in opposite direction and hence the fringe can be to be move outwards and inwards on either side of the null point provide the secondary mirror be move and thus allow u to find the null point 's position a a result of this a number of simulation can be take to predict this behaviour show in figure 3,4 and 5. figure 3 be the expect inteferogram for white light with a wider beam and a can be see be it narrow nature and this be also explain through fourier analysis due to the fourier transforms the wider the frequency range the shorter transform and hence a narrow interferogram for white light figure 4 be in regard to a multitude of different wavelength and in this case 4 wavelength these wavelength show in figure 5 represent their respective intensity to form this pattern however the practical application of this data raise an important concept the coherence length of the signal be the distance over which an electromagnetic signal will retain the characteristic of a coherent signal this be also define through the degree of coherence with the first degree of coherence be related to it amplitude and the second degree of coherence in relation to intensity this report be in regard to the first degree of coherence 3 however an important concept behind the fourier transforms act upon the interferogram be the nyquist theorem this theorem show that in order for all the information to be correctly interpret from a signal the band limit must be great than half the sample frequency this be best show through figure 6 which be a visual representation of how the same raw signal may produce an incorrect transformation due to the sample rate this incorrect signal be aliasing 4 fig 6. this be a visual representation of the nyquist theorem 's result the observation that we will make will also be look into whether the source exhibit a black body behaviour and this be show in planck 's law this be represent a a continuous frequency spectrum that be dependent upon a source 's temperature and a a result this should also be see from our wavelength fourier transform in addition we will consider wien 's displacement law which be represent a where b be represent the wien 's displacement constant λ max be the wavelength with the great intensity amplitude and t represent the temperature of the source be consider 1 the setup that we follow be the same a that in figure 1. in order to use this setup we have to follow certain procedure in order to ensure that the mirror be correctly align to align the mirror we first have to ensure that each of the surface be clean and that any imperfection should be take away use isopropanol on the mirror and lens the height of each part of the setup be already correctly setup and with the motor for mirror 2 already set into place the rest of the setup be orientate around it position the mirror be place perpendicular to each other and a metal arm for the beamsplitter be place in the direction of the detector we also place a lens with a 100 mm focal length to focus the light of the green laser we use for alignment we would then adjust the setup accordingly to ensure that light be hit the centre of mirror 1 and 2. we then adjust mirror 1 accordingly to ensure they would align and for the the light to interfere to ensure that laser be align perfectly we would use the side wall of the entire setup to use a large distance so that any misalignment could be more easily see from this you should be able to see the haidinger fringe after see the haidinger fringe we then move onto find the null point and this be achieve through a method of interval bisection we first move to the maximum displacement of each end of the motor movement to record the direction of the fringe to see whether they be move inwards or outwards we would then move to 0 mm and then depend upon the movement of the fringe we then half the range we be look into through this method we be able to achieve a range of 0.2-0.3 mm for the null point and this be large than we have do in previous attempt because in prior attempt when move onto other source the null point may have move due to the human error of replace equipment and hence minor adjustment to the setup in order to record data we have to use a linux o and this be very different to the prior o we have be in contact with nonetheless in order to record data the detector be connect to the computer via a usb to account for the flow of data collection we have to provide a command for 'usb low latency within a terminal window for the data collection we would then use the 'take data command which be proceed by 3 number represent the point mirror 2 should move to it speed and the number of sample take this data be record into an output data file locate on the desktop and upon the end of sample this data have to be save each time to avoid lose the data since a new set of reading would go over the top of the reading previously record this data would then be uploaded into the simple fit 2.py file and then from there the dsamp have to be adjust the adjustment be need to account for the speed of the motor the sample rate of the detector ran that ran at a rate of 50hz and that the distance move by the arm would have to be double due to signal travel both to the mirror and back to the beamsplitter a a result we then move onto record our data first we use the white lead follow by the blue lead and white tungsten source with either a green or yellow filter for the lead we remove the lens and put in a ground glass diffuser and also place more black card between each part of the setup to ensure no light from other aspect of the setup would cause far interference for each of these source we chose between speed of 0.0001 and 0.002 mm/s depend on which record and we would move over an area of 0.2-0.3 mm in the range over -3.1mm and -2.8mm for mirror 2. the signal that we would see on the visual representation of the live data collection approximately look like a sine wave and then approach the null point the signal should become clearer with a much great amplitude the visual qualitative data of each source would sometimes aid in location for example with white light there should be a rainbow on either side of the null point and at the null point it should black and white these data file be then put into the simple fit 2 file on the spyder platform and from this 3 figure be produce the raw data inteferogram oscillation per sample against amplitude and then the wavelength against amplitude the last of these figure be form from the fourier transform the methodology for the data calculation that i undertook be to take a fft fast-fourier transform of the interferogram and from this gain a gaussian distribution for the wavelength since this be a first order of coherence be consider the amplitude graph will only be consider when put against the wavelength a a result the raw data will not be show however the final data plot shall be give for each with analysis follow therefore in figure 7 the final wavelength for the white lead can be found fig 7. this be the plot of the wavelength distribution for the white lead from this data it can be see there be a gaussian distribution for the white light however what 's also noticeable be the two peak within the data these two peak be due to the temperature of the lead 4 where if a cooler lead be use the left peak would be much great this be also the expect range because it be able to cover the entirety of the visible wavelength thus correspond to a white light the value in figure 8 show the gaussian fit for the blue lead and this be also near the expect value for the blue lead which be in the range of 450-475nm 5 on the other hand the peak should correspond to a delta function since we be assume the source to be of a constant wavelength the error in the plot can also correspond to the error in the step size of the motor for mirror 2 and thus show in table 1 's data and correspond to the ∆λ this should correspond to one single wave-packet and hence one wavelength and therefore a dirac delta function however this be not what be see and hence the error in the value corresponds to the error in the step size this source produce a lot more noise in the signal and this can be attribute to the nature of the source and it relative instability compare to the lead the use of the filter however be important when regard this distribution a can be see in figure 10 for the other filter use in figure 10 it be able to show the nature of the yellow filter with the green light of the tungsten the two clear peak in the wavelength distribution show the inadequacy of the gaussian fit for the entirety of this region however also when look at the raw data it be similar to that of the sinc function which be the fourier transformation of the top hat function and hence this be also able to show the behaviour of the filter and it functionality for the different wavelength and how they interact 4 overall however the data can be show in the follow table for the data of our source the equation use for these calculation can be work backwards from the error in the gaussian of the wavelength distribution they can be show in the follow two equation where l be the coherence length ∆v be the spectral width and c be the speed of light for these calculation therefore by approximate the σ in the wavelength gaussian a ∆λ all calculation can be make 1 the value of t be calculate use wien 's displacement law and this be under the assumption each source be act a a black body however this ca n't be infer from the graph due to the lack of the correct shape over their respective region this be because they do not have their slight offset in the correct direction and with the presence off too much noise this assumption can not be make however other conclusion could be make from the data for example the variation in the coherence length of the source and a expect white have the shortest coherence length and this can be held accountable to the variation in the spectral width since white light cover a much large range of frequency our experiment be base upon the idea of a michelson interferometer and we be able to retrieve the wavelength of a multitude of different source and from this also collect information about the spectral width of the source also we be also able to observe the behaviour of the filter that be be use within the experiment however if we be to redo this experiment it would be to have adjust the setup such that noise could be remove for example the reduction of light impact the setup we would also have look into the distribution of the noise and the influence of temperature more greatly also the vibration influence the movement of the detector and hence the measurement overall i believe that we be able to achieve the goal of the experiment and that with these experiment it would have be easy to see the behaviour that we be expect from the theory",deep,bal
113,2ndINT_KSN764_Redacted,an investigation into the spectrum of multiple optical source be undertaken with the use of a fourier transform spectrometer the interferograms record and result spectrum by use of the fourier transform be analyse against both theoretical and manufacturer-provided component specific spectrum both the white lead and tungsten lamp source match the expect spectrum after compensate for wavelength-dependent filter of the detector in addition to this multiple unexpected find in the data be examine and many remain inexplicable without far investigation these include an asymmetry in the white lead interferogram and unexpected structure in the spectrum of the optical filter m ade infamous by the null result of the 1887 michelson-morley experiment 1 the michelson interferometer be a simple yet powerful arrangement of optical component invent by the american physicist albert abraham michelson the michelson interferometer split a light source into two separate beam before recombine them and analyse the interference pattern fig 1. a the interference pattern observe be dependent only on phase difference not on absolute phase they do not vary with time this allows measurement of distance on the order of the wavelength of light ∼ 10 −7 m by change the length of one or both of the arm a michelson interferometer of this type be use by ligo and virgo to successfully detect gravitational wave in 2015 2 however the interferometer can be use for spectrometry by make one of the mirror movable this change the arm length and so change the observe interference the exact mechanism for this be cover in section ii-a this method can have considerable advantage over dispersive method of spectroscopy such a diffraction grate and prism refraction these include the ability to measure all frequency at once and an increase signal to noise ratio from the lack of an aperture an investigation into use this spectrometer to analyse various source be undertaken if the path difference and thus phase difference between the beam be change the result interference pattern will also change it be this property of the interferometer that allows it to be use a an incredibly precise ruler if instead we measure the change in interference pattern for a know path difference the spectrum of the light source can be calculate for a monochromatic but not necessarily coherent source the intensity of the electrical or magnetic component of the signal that reach the detector will be proportional to y 2 such that where k be the wavenumber of the light source x be the position of the detector with increase x towards the beamsplitter ω be the angular frequency of the light source t be the elapse time and φ be the phase difference from the movement of the stage the movable mirror if the stage be to move by a distance d the phase difference φ would become 2kd substitute this and evaluate at x 0 for a static detector give by use of the trigonometric identity this be the form of a travel wave in d within an envelope of co kd for electromagnetic radiation within the visible range ω be of the order 10 15 rad s −1 and so the detector like the eye only measure the envelope note that a dielectric plate in the setup add a half wavelength phase change make the envelope sinusoidal rather than co-sinusoidal 2 polychromatic source when the source be compose of multiple frequency of light fig 2 the envelope combine and form beating pattern give by where k 1 and k 2 be the wavenumbers of the two frequency like any beating pattern this give an envelope with wavenumber k 1 − k 2 and interior oscillation of wavenumber a the stage be move over the measurement range the result interferogram be therefore a combination of these sinusoidal envelope it can therefore be see that the interferogram be proportional to the fourier transform of the spectrum of the source whence it alternative name arises however this be not the waveform of the light produce by the source despite these both be fourier transforms of the same spectrum an incoherent source will still produce an interferogram with finite coherence length consider mount a coherent monochromatic source on the stage and measure the light emit directly with a detector although the stage can move distance a fraction of the wavelength of the source light a realistic detector would still record a constant value for all stage position due to the speed of the oscillation and propagation of the light an optical filter be a device which reduces certain frequency of light pas through it accord to give characteristic although some filter effect be intentional e.g to modify the spectrum of a source unintended filter effect be also present the main source of unintended filter arises from the detector fig 3. data collect will therefore be significantly skewed if wavelength vary over a range of more than ∼ 100 nm or lie particularly far from ∼ 800 nm the apparatus be first construct a in fig 1. the distance between the component and the detector be minimise to reduce any effect of mis-alignment in the setup this improve the accuracy of the reading by minimise the effect of the recombine beam not be parallel to align the setup the green laser be use a a source since it be effectively monochromatic this mean it interferogram have a large coherence length allow interference to be observe far from the null point the detector be replace by a paper board and the position of the mirror and beamsplitter be adjust until all of the observable point of light overlap entirely dim point of light where the beam have be internally reflect one or more time between component be also move to the same position a in a perfectly orthogonal system these would not be visible after alignment a short focal length lens be use to expand the source make interference pattern more visible and maximise coverage of the mirror the stage 's position be then adjust until the interference pattern grow large and the direction of fringe motion with stage displacement flip over a give interval a white lead be then use to scan over this same interval until `` rainbow `` like fringe be observe fig 4 mark the null point due to it broad spectrum the white lead interferogram have a very short coherence length and so precise measurement of the null point be possible the spectrum of a tungsten lamp be expect to follow a black-body thermal emission curve from this we expect the interferogram to be smooth and without beating pattern which be observe fig 5. take the fourier transform of this interferogram we see that the spectrum be smooth and bell shape it also peak at around 900 nm a expect from the manufacturer 's spectrum of the source fig 7. however a a black-body curve it would be expect to be strongly positively skewed whereas fig 6 show no significant skew this be confirm by fig 7. this be due to filter by the detector a outline in section 11-b from fig 3 the maximum sensitivity of the detector occurs at around 930 ± 20 nm with strong negative skew therefore the product of the source spectrum and the filter be go to have little skew and a peak at around 900 nm a observe in fig 6. noteworthy be the smoothness of the record spectrum since accord to fig 7 there should be more structure present this be most likely due to the speed of the stage be too high and so too few data point be collect a white and a blue lead be investigate a source and their interferograms fig 9 and fig 10 respectively show with venow flrter fig 6. a fourier transfonn of the interferograms of a tungsten source with green yellow and no filler -- -- -- -- -- -- -- smooth envelope with little to no beating a expect from the smoothness of fig 8. interferograms of the white lead with green and yellow filter be also take fig 11 yellow omit due to similarity unexpectedly both of these interferograms clearly show beating from fig 8 and the spectral transmission form of the green filter fig 13 the result spectrum would be expect to be a smooth bell shape without any beating the same applies to the yellow filter for far analysis see section iv-c. fourier transform these four interferograms and combine them for comparison fig 12 the general form of the white lead be see to match that of fig 8. however the relative intensity of the narrow and broad peak be different this can be explain by the filter of the detector fig 3 with the shorter wavelength peak be attenuate more than the longer wavelength peak although less insight can be attain from the blue lead spectrum it show a similar form to the shorter wavelength peak of the white lead but with the centre shift to the longer wavelength of 460 ± 10 nm that of blue light this be what might be expect of a source operating by the same physical principal a the white lead the white lead interferogram fig 9 contains a significant asymmetry since an interferogram be make up of only sinusoidal function this structure can not occur in ideal fourier transform interferometer initial hypothesis be the alignment of the setup the direction of stage movement and the structure in the source to investigate the alignment hypothesis the setup be realign and then another interferogram record of the white lead this have a negligible effect the direction of stage movement also have little effect to investigate possible asymmetry in the lead a ground glass filter be place in front of the source and the source be move back by 5 cm this have little effect upon closer inspection of the source structure small bright patch w avelength nm fig 13. the manufacturer 's transmission percentage of the green filter 7 the yellow filter be of the same form that be not radially symmetrical be found see appendix a. to corroborate this the same interferogram be take four time each time rotate the lead by 90 • this also have no effect our remain hypothesis be that this arises either from internal reflection within the setup or from the translationwise position of the lead apply the green and yellow filter to both the tungsten and white lead source it become apparent that both filter on both light source produce spectrum of the same form but shift to their appropriate wavelength compare all four of these spectrum fig 14 it can be see that they all exhibit the same general form four main peak with the long wavelength peak be round despite the suppose transmission characteristic of the filter fig 13. although this explains the beating pattern see in all four interferograms for example fig 11 the reason for these peak be unknown since it be present in all four spectrum it be likely to be due to the way the filter operate or be construct the centre of the four spectrum be found to correspond to their expect value closely the investigation into the fourier transform spectrometer provide insight into the characteristic of the various source use but also raise multiple unknown the tungsten source spectrum be found to be a expect once the frequency dependence of the detector sensitivity be account for however the reason for the smoothness of what should be a jagged spectrum be currently not fully understood the lead spectrum be also found to match the predict form once accounting for the detector sensitivity despite this the cause of the asymmetry in the interferogram could not be found even after extensive investigation the filter source also produce spectrum that be both unexpected and inexplicable however their central wavelength closely match those which be predict all thing consider the investigation verify many characteristic of the source use whilst provide a platform to perform far investigation into unexpected area if it be to be repeat far analysis of unexpected find such a the asymmetry of the lead interferogram might provide insight into the detail of the setup,expert,bal
114,2ndINT_JUA192_Redacted,the wavelength of four different light source a white lead a blue lead and tungsten with a yellow and green filter have be determine use a michelson intel'fe1•omete1• act a a fourier transform spectromete1• an interferogram centre at the null point for each source be found and fourier transform to give the wavelength spectrum the spread of wavelength have also be found and compare to the expect range of wavelength for all the source there be a large overlap between the calculate range of wavelength and the expect range of wavelength in most case the calculate upper and low bound be within 1 t of the true value the michelson interferometer be developed by albeit a michelson in 1881 to detect the flow of the ether -the postulate medium for the propagation of light 1 1. the improve experiment in 1887 the michelson -morley experiment be now widely know a the most famous 'failed experiment in the field of physic after disprove the existence of the ether in 1887 michelson and morley discover fine structure splitting of some of the balmer line this be possible due to the high precision of the assemble apparatus which be previously require to theoretically detect the now disprove ether the precision of the apparatus be what allows for the characterisation of the spectmm of various light sow•ces characterise the spectrum of various light source be cmcial to gain insight into the composition of various object include star to find the elemental composition of an object use it spectmm you must first know the spectmm of the suspect element to a high degree of accuracy in this experiment the michelson interferometer have be alter to be use a a fourier transform spectrometer in order to find the spectrum of various light source in this investigation the michelson interferometer have be use a a fourier transfo1m spectrometer -only one miitor be fix while the other be allow to move two type of fringe can be see use the setup -haidinger fringe and fizeau fringe the setup in fig 1 would result in visible haidinger fringe at the detector due to the mu1'0rs be in a perpendicular alignment if one mu1'0r be to be tilt slightly fizeau fringe be visible the separation between the null point and the translate mirror position have be label t. ml represent the position of the move mirror while m2 represent the position of the fix mirror when ml be at m2 it be the same distance from the beam splitter a m2 adapt from 2 the order of visible haidinger fringe can be show to be where t be the be the separation between the move mirror and the null point the point where the two mi11'0rs be equidistant from the beam splitter 0 be the angle between an incoming light ray and the view axis see fig 2 m be the order of interference and .. l be the wavelength of the light note that in this experiment multiple wavelength will be present in the light source characterise the visible haidinger fringe be thus circular and concentric for a constant 𝑡 𝑚 and 𝜆 the angle 𝜃 be constant movement of m1 will allow for an interferogram to be found which plot the amplitude a a function of distance from the null point this allows for the spectrum of the source to be produce by perform a fourier transform on the interferogram in this investigation a fast fourier transform fft algorithm have be use from the scipy library in python the fourier transform give a plot with the oscillation per step on the x axis i.e the wavenumber 𝜈 ̃ from the nature of fourier transforms it can be show that a wider fringe on an interferogram lead to a narrower gaussian spectral line this plot can then be manipulate to give the wavelength spectrum since to find the range of wavelength δ𝜆 the spectral width δ𝜈 must first be found where 𝑐 be the speed of light and l be the coherence lengththe propagation distance over which the coherence significantly decrease this can be found by fitting the record interferograms with a gaussian curve where 𝜎 of the gaussian represent l. the range of wavelength δ𝜆 be then where 𝜆 be the mean wavelength found from take the fft of the interferogram and manipulate it use 2 this allows for 𝜆 to be quote with a give spread for each light source investigate alternatively δ𝜆 can be measure from the fwhm full width at half maximum of the wavelength spectrum the apparatus be assemble so that it resemble fig 1. each object be attach to the base use a clamp which be then screw into place this ensure that there be no movement of any part of the setupa small change in position can completely misalign the apparatus to correctly align the mirror and source with the beam splitter a green laser be use in conjunction with a converge lens a screen be place in the position of the detector allow for the mirror to be adjust so that beam a and b see fig 1 be both perfectly overlap this require tilt the fix mirror and then align it correctly in the plane by adjust the beam position along the vertical and horizontal ax partial reflection at the beam splitter boundary be also account for so that the reflect beam also overlap perfectly with the beam a and b. the screen be also displace towards and away from the beam splitter to ensure that the beam be truly overlap rather than converge at a point on the screen once the apparatus be align the null point be found the green laser now show the follow haidinger fringe on the screen a large amount of fringe be visible use 1 it can be see that for a fix 𝑚 𝑡 increase a 𝜃 decrease suggest that more fringe be visible a m1 get far from the null

found it be found to be 2.5916 ± 0.0001 mm note that in practice the distance between measurement make by the detector be not constant but have be assume to be constant for the purpose of this investigation to characterise light source interferograms be plot for each source a gaussian curve be fit to each interferogram use a least square curve fit from the scipy library in python the parameter for 𝜎 be then equivalent to value of l in 3 allow for the use of 4 to find δ𝜆 the value of 𝜆 use be obtain by use a fft algorithm see section ii on the interferogram to find a spectrum resemble a gaussian centre at the wavelength from which 𝜆 can be easily extract from this spectrum δ𝜆 can be calculate by measure the fwhm thus give two separate method to estimate δ𝜆 to increase precision four source be investigate a white lead a blue lead and a white tungsten source with two separate filter green and blue for each source a plot of the interferogram with the fit gaussian curve have be produce a well a a plot show the wavelength spectrum produce use a fft see section ii on the interferogram for the white lead the follow fit be make the standard deviation be found to be 4.22 ± 0.08 × 10 -7 m. the error have be obtain from the covariance matrix of the curve fit use for the gaussian curve this lead to a value of 1.13 ± 0.02 × 10 14 hz for δ𝜈 to give context to this value the wavelength spectrum must be consider compare fig 6 to fig 7 it can be see that the narrow interferogram give a wider spectrum a expect for white light the range of wavelength within the white light source can be estimate by take the fwhm of the spectrum which give a range between 504 ± 2 nm and 677±2 nmthis cover a large range of the visible spectrum which be generally quote a lie between 380 nm and 740 nm 4 the error of the fwhm measurement come from measurement error use the python figure the value of δ𝜆 calculate use this method be therefore 173 ± 3 nm use the mean wavelength a 𝜆 4 can be use to find δ𝜆 this give a value of 137 ± 2 nm for δ𝜆 which clearly differs from the value obtain from the previous method the mean wavelength be estimate to be 602 ± 20 nmthis be obtain by judging the centre point of the apparent gaussian that would fit the spectrum in fig 7. the error in the lack of precision of this method have be account for in the quote value take an average of the two method the white lead emits wavelength in a range of 504 -677 nm with a mean 𝜆 of 602 ± 20 nm and a δ𝜆 of 155 ± 4 nm the range found be encompass in the expect rangethe discrepancy be likely due to the white lead spectrum since there be no distinct peak for white light try to compare the error between 𝜆 ± ∆𝜆 2 and the true upper and low bound for the range be pointless for the blue lead see fig 8 for the interferogram produce 𝜎 be found to be 1.18 ± 0.03 × 10 -6 m give δ𝜈 a 4.0 ± 0.1 × 10 13 hz the spectral width be an order of magnitude small than the white lead which can be expect since the blue lead should contain a much narrower range of frequency the wavelength be found use fig 9. the mean wavelength of the blue lead be see much easy since only a single symmetric peak be visible find δ𝜆 use the fwhm give a value of 32 ± 3 nm with a range of 447 ± 2 nm 479 ± 2 nm use 4 with a value of 463 ± 1 nm a 𝜆 δ𝜆 be found to be 29 ± 1 nmit can be see that both value be very similar with an overlap error range this be likely due to the increase 7 the wavelength spectrum of the white lead the dip in intensity at ~500 nm be worth note since this be a common feature for various type of white lead 5 l ... accuracy of the estimate for 𝜆 from fig 9 since the spectrum be symmetric this give an average of 31 ± 3 nm for δ𝜆 the accepted range for blue light be 450 nm -490 nm 6 which mean the range of wavelength and mean wavelength have be calculate accurately the only inaccuracy be the upper bound wavelength 𝜆 δ𝜆 2 479 ± 3 nm not 490 nm a expect this be likely due to the spectrum of the blue lead not exactly reproduce the entirety of the visible blue range to confirm this a gaussian must be fit to fig 9 to more accurately estimate δ𝜆 and comparison must be drawn with the manufacturer 's specification for the lead the range of the expect range of wavelength be within 3 𝜎 of the upper range of the calculate upper bound for the range and within 1 𝜎 of the low boundthe result found be fairly accurate for the plot for the tungsten source with the green and yellow filter see the appendix for the green filter 𝜆 be 534 ± 3 nm with a δ𝜆 value of 34 ± 2 nm the true green range be 520 -560 nm the calculate low range lie within 1 𝜎 while the upper range lie within 2.5 𝜎 of the true value for the yellow filter 𝜆 be 571 ± 4 nm with a δ𝜆 value of 33 ± 2 nm the true yellow range be 560 -590 nm both the calculate upper and low range lie within 1 𝜎 of the true value it be also worth note the existence of two peak for both filter which be not expect the filter should theoretically allow a single wavelength through with a gaussian spread resemble the spectrum in fig 9. the reason for this be unknown also note for all the source use the space between measurement be not constant due to restraint in the motor connect to m1 a well a the software use to obtain the wavelength spectrum via a fft the sample space must be presume to be constant the value use for each plot be 41 nm with each source have a different amount of sample take v. conclusion four different light source have be investigate use a michelson interferometer act a a fourier transform spectrometer the null point point where the two mirror be equidistant from the beam splitter be found for each light source data be record near the null point to plot an interferogram for each source the interferograms be then fourier transform to find the wavelength and spread of wavelength for each source the spread of wavelength be found use two method the first method involve measure the fwhm of the wavelength spectrum while the second use a gaussian fit on each interferogram to find the spectral width allow for the wavelength spectrum to be calculate for every wavelength calculate the range of wavelength overlap with the theoretical range with a small error to increase accuracy the experiment can be perform in an environment that reduces any vibration since the mirror m1 be move at fraction of a wavelength this may be the reason why the spectrum for tungsten produce two peak rather than one far investigation must be do to increase precision and reduce the effect of background light and vibration lt-7,superficial,bal
115,2ndINT_OXY643_Redacted,we use a michelson interferometer to investigate the spectral composition of blue and while lead and a tungsten white light source with green and yellow filter we fast

𝝁𝒎 since a tungsten source act a a black body we use wien 's displacement law to estimate it operating temperature a 𝟑𝟑𝟐𝟎 𝑲. the michelson interferometer have be a useful tool in uncover the physic underpin many physical phenomenon it be use famously in 1887 in the michelson-morley experiment to disprove the theory of the luminiferous ether since it have be greatly refine and in 2015 be use in the ligo experiment to observe the first gravitational wave in this experiment we use the michelson interferometer to investigate the characteristic of different light source we use a green lead source to align the interferometer and locate the null point -the position at which light observes the mirror a be equidistant from the source we observe that at this point haidinger fringe appear to stop move inwards and start move outwards from the central maximum we use a detector to measure the amplitude of the signal produce when mirror 2 m2 be move across a small region surround the null point for each of the light source use the fourier transform of these interferograms we be able to measure the mean wavelength and spectral width of the emission spectrum of the light source and be far able to measure their coherence length for the white light tungsten source we be also able to determine it operating temperature ii theory a michelson interferometer consists of a light source a beam splitter two mirror and a detector in a set-up illustrate in fig 1. the beam splitter divide the light from the source into two beam direct to either mirror one side of the mirror have a dielectric plate which change the phase of one of these beam in such a way that when there be zero path difference between the mirror destructive interference occurs the wave interfere at the beam splitter and pa towards the detector where the signal amplitude be measure m2 be set in motion and the signal amplitude change a the path difference change the detector be connect to a computer which plot the interferogram if the mirror be at right angle to one another and the beam splitter be align correctly then the parallel light ray appear to be come from infinity and circular fringe know a haidinger fringe be visible if the mirror be slightly tilt relative to one another the ray appear to come from an extend source reflect by two mirror separate by a fix distance and fizeau fringe be visible the location of the maximum of the signal be govern by 1 where 𝑡 be the separation of m1 and m2 𝜃 be the angle of incidence of the ray at the mirror and 𝑚 be the order of the maximum see vii appendix for derivation a filter have an associate bandwidth which be transmit when a light source be project through it ideally this would have a square form where each wavelength within the bandwidth be completely transmit however this be unrealistic and the filter we use have a gaussian transmission form the green filter transmits a mean wavelength of 543.5 ± 2 𝑛𝑚 with s 4.2 ± 0.8 𝑛𝑚 the yellow filter transmits a mean wavelength of 580 ± 2 𝑛𝑚 coherence length be a of the distance over which one arm of a michelson interferometer can be scan before the interferogram contrast becomes poor 2 theoretically speak for path difference great than the coherence length the phase difference become random 3 the coherence length be related to the spectral width by where ∆𝑣 be the spectral width -a measure of the range of frequency emit by the source since we fourier investigate the characteristic of different light source and filter transform the interferogram into wavelength space we must convert the wavelength width to spectral width use the follow relation where δ𝜆 be the wavelength width and 𝜆 be the mean wavelength prior to construct the interferometer we simulated the interferogram and wavelength spectrum that we would expect for a white light source and a blue lead these be displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively the wavelength spectrum of the white light source be a gaussian encompass all wavelength in the visible spectrum the relatively wide spectral width give rise to the narrow interferogram on the other hand the blue lead have a very narrow spectral width and so have a much wider interferogram this follow directly from 2 during the construction of the interferometer we make sure that the mirror be roughly equidistant from beam splitter so that the null point laid within the movable range of m2 we connect a green lead source and the beam splitter via a convex lens with a focal length of 25.4 𝑚𝑚 to widen the light from the lead and a matte black lens tube of length 54.6 𝑚𝑚 to reduce interference from the reflect light precaution to avoid interference from reflect ray with the ray directly leave the source be take by place dark card diagonally between the component the detector be temporarily substitute for a screen on which the interference fringe be align by tile m1 the narrow spectral width of an lead mean that the interference fringe can be observe over the entire moveable range of the green lead when haidinger fringe be visible throughout the entire range of movement the mirror be sufficiently well align to locate the null point we low the mirror speed sufficiently so that we could observe the movement of the fringe if the detector be move in the direction of the null point the fringe appear to converge into the central maximum a govern by 1 when move towards the null point 𝑡 → 0 and so co 𝜃 get large and so 𝜃 → 0 result in the ray appear to come from infinity by observe the motion of the fringe in a give direction about particular point along the range of m2 we be able to locate the null point within a range of ~0.25 𝑚𝑚 then use the interferogram and white lead we be able to locate the null point at 2.990 ± 0.01 𝑚𝑚 due to the relatively large spectral width of a white lead the interference fringe only appear very close the null point use the method described in iii method we measure the interferogram and wavelength spectrum of the white lead see in the fig 4. an rgb lead that generates white light have contribution from three component of light red green and blue thus correspond to a sum of three gaussians since the red and green curve be not distinguishable we have only fit two gaussian curve the blue gaussian with low amplitude have an average wavelength of 462.7 ± 0.3 nm and the red/green have an average wavelength of 622.5 ± 0.4 nm where the unce1tainty be obtain through evaluate the covariance matrix by weigh the wavelength of the spectrum by the standard deviation and amplitude of the gaussians we can measure the average wavelength a 608.5 ± 0.5 nm the spectral width be equal to the full width at half-maximum fwhm and be calculate use the standard deviation of the wavelength we obtain a value for .1il of 46.9 ± 0.9 nm and 234 ± 1 nm respectively thus give u a total of 281 ± 2 nm fmthe1more use 3 we obtain a .1v measurement of227 ± 1 thz and by 2 a measurement for l of 1.32 ± 0.01 µm the fonn of the interferogram and simulation differ slightly a a result of the difference in the number of gaussian te1ms sum to create the signal they do however both exhibit a spectral width and coherence length the interferogram and wavelength spectrum for the blue lead be show in fig 5. the average wavelength of the blue lead be 457.8 ± 0.1 nm and the standard deviation be 11.7 ± 0.1 nm from this we can obtain a .1v measurement for the blue lead of 39.4 ± 0.3 thz use 2 we measure la 7.61 ± 0.07 µm finally we measm•ed the inteiferograms and wavelength spectrum of the white light tungsten source with green and yellow filter and without a filter these be displayed in fig 6. total word count 2484 -3 first we will discus the result for the filter tungsten light source for the green filter we fit a gaussian to the wavelength spectrum since the expect transmission spectrum of the filter be a gaussian the mean wavelength be 555.2nm ± 0.1 nm and the standard deviation be 18.2 nm ± 0.1 nm we obtain a .1v measurement of 41.7 ± 0.2 thz and use 2 we show l be 7.17 ± 0.06 µm for the yellow filter tungsten light we conduct a similar analysis and measure the mean wavelength of the source a 590.5 nm ± 0.1 nm and the standard deviation a 25.4 nm ± 0.1 nm we measure .1v a 51.4 ± 0.2 thz and use 2 show that l be 5.84 ± 0.19µm for the white light tungsten source we do not fit a gaussian since tungsten source such a incandescent lamp emit a continuous spectmm so we would expect a black body spectrum we can estimate the average temperature of the tungsten filament by apply wien 's displacement law for black body where t be the temperature of the filament a.peak be the wavelength at which the peak of the curve be locate and b be wien 's displacement constant from fig 6 aii we can show that ii.peak be 874.1 nm which corresponds to a temperature of 3320 k. however the curve do not exactly replicate the black body spectrum this be because the curve be the product of a combination of two curve a black body spectium and figure 6 ai show the interferogramfor the white light tungsten source with no filter figure 6 aii show the wavelength spectrum for the white light tungsten source with no filter figure 6 bi show the interferogramfor the white light tungsten source with a green filter figure 6 bii show the wavelength spectrum for the white light tungsten source with a green filter with a gaussian fit the mean be 555 2nm ± 0.1 nm and the standard deviation be 18.2 nm ± 0.1 nm figure 6 ci show the interferogramfor the white light tungsten source with no filter figure 6 cii show the wavelength spectrum/or the white light tungsten source with a yellow filter with a gaussian fit the mean be 590 5 nm ± 0.1 nm and the standard deviation be 25.4 nm ± 0.1 nm the detector 's detectable spectnun which lie only around the white lead since white light be sum of all of all wavelength visible wave spectmm therefore it would not be sufficient in the visible spectnun this result in the blue lead have to fit a black body spectmm to fig 6 aii without know a significantly large coherence length than the white lead the fo1m of the detection spectmm of the detector which be a direct consequence of 2 both source also have the aim of this experiment be to use a michelson interferometer to investigate the characteristic spectrum of a blue and white lead and a white light tungsten source with a green filter a yellow filter and with no filter we simulated the interferogram and wavelength spectmm for the lead source prior to conduct the experiment we measure the signal for each source sunounding the null point and use a fast fomier transfonn to deduce the wavelength spectmm that produce the signal through the analysis of the wavelength spectnun we measure the spectral width and coherence length of each source a expect the spectral width of the blue lead be significantly small than that of the total word count 2484 similar wavefo1ms to their simulation the wavelength spectmm of the tungsten source do not replicate the expect black body curve due to the limited range of wavelength that the detector be able to register the green and yellow filter source do take their expect gaussian fonn under an envelope gaussian since the filter be clean before use and we observe similar fonns in both the green and yellow spectrum i assume that the oscillate shape arises due to a defect in the source the e1rnrs in the measure value can be attribute to a va1iety of source m2 be move sufficiently slowly that the vibration of the

116,2ndINT_KGL587_Redacted,"the michelson interferometer be a simple set up of apparatus that can produce precise measurement the device consists of two plain mirror a beam splitter and a detector figure 1 light be direct into the beam splitter a the detector measure the intensity of the light reach it the device be famously use 1 by michelson morley in 1887 2 to measure the speed of the earth through the hypothesise 'aether the interferometer detects interference that arises due to different propagation path length after a light beam be split figure 1 3 -a basic schematic diagram of the

source will appear monochromatic to human this dominant colour be make from a superposition of different frequency this experiment will use the interferometer a a spectrometer 4 to decompose different light source into their component frequency we want to gain an understand of the relevant physic and mathematics underpin this experiment we want to reason why the fourier transforms of our interferograms be relevant and we will make prediction of the type of fringe we expect and the mathematics behind why we aim to find the 'null point of the interferometer to a high precision ±0.001𝑚𝑚 the null point be define where t=0 in figure 1. this will tell u when the interferometer be in it 'base formation we will be scan over this point for the various light source we will take detailed interferograms of three light source a white lead a blue lead and an incandescent tungsten lamp the interferograms will be centre on the null point and will show the intensity of the light signal detect at incremental distance from this point we will perform fast fourier transforms fft with a computer on our data to study the amplitude of the light source in wavelength space this will give u a spectrum of the light within the source we will approximate gaussian function to the envelope of the interferograms where appropriate and perform mathematical fourier transforms on these function use figure 1 we derive various equation that produce prediction for our observation and measurement the light beam that travel an extra distance 2t will have developed a phase shift relative to the other beam on arrive at the beam splitter this phase shift for monochromatic light will only produce maximum and minimum when we will observe maximum minimum in the intensity a when 't be equal to a quarter integer number of wavelength 𝑛=1,3,5… 1 from this we can deduce that the intensity oscillates between maximum and minimum with a periodicity of 𝑡 𝑛 𝜆/4 there be two type of fringe that we can expect haidinger or fizeau haidinger fringe be observe when the tilt label in figure 1 be negligible this setup produce circular concentric fringe when the tilt be non-zero straight-line fizeau fringe be

tight gaussian in frequency space small 𝜎 𝑔 the spectral width δ𝜈 can be found from a measurement of the coherence length the coherence length can be measure from the interferogram directly it be the

where l 𝐴𝜎 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 we can convert δ𝜈 to a width in wavelength space by the relation combine equation 7 and 8 we obtain where 𝜎 𝜆 be the spread in wavelength and be equal to δ𝜆 this 𝜎 𝜆 can also be found from the fft of the interferogram use the proportionality relation the equipment be set up such that the path difference t be approximately 0 measure with a ruler the interferometer be align use a green laser of small cross section the detector be remove we shone the laser at a wall around 3m from the beam splitter make sure no people be in it path a this laser could damage a human 's eye two separate dot be observe on the wall a non-zero tilt in both plane of the mirror be apparent we use the fine adjustment knob on mirror b to bring the two dot together until total superposition the equipment be then securely screw down to the optical table to minimise movement we insert a beam expander lens in front of the laser and haidinger fringe be observe we be now in a position to find the null point for this we start with the same green laser the green laser have a small spectral width and thus a broad interferogram so we can scan over a large range of t value and be observe fluctuation in amplitude once we have narrow down the location of the null point to an uncertainty of 2mm we remove the green laser and mount the white lead white light have a broad frequency spectrum fourier analysis tell u that this will yield a localise interferogram and so can refine our value of the null point to a high precision we scan over an increasingly small range around the null point until we see oscillation in amplitude of the interferogram nearer the null point the fringe become large at the null point no fringe be observe have reduce our uncertainty in the null point to ±0.001𝑚𝑚 we begin to take data this involve position the stage that support mirror c to a point behind the null point and then slowly translate the stage forward through the null point whilst take data our data logger take a pre-set 50 reading per second the slow we move the stage the more data we obtain the interferograms plot have oscillatory property with an overall gaussian-like envelope we plot the data use a linux terminal and perform an fft from the wavelength spectrum plot we can learn about the composition of the various light source and deduce value for the coherence length and spectral width the initial scan over the null point with green light be make from negative 5mm to +5mm this take around 16 minute whilst the stage move we observe the fringe change the circular fringe propagate outwards like water ripple after a stone be drop the fringe become wider nearer the null point once the mirror have move past the null point the direction of their movement be reverse the circular fringe then move inwards we watch the hypnotise fringe and make note of the approximate location at which this inversion occur from this we perform a scan with the green laser from 2.6mm to 3.5mm -figure 8. after narrow down the location of the null point to ±1mm we exchange the green laser for the white lead we complete a scan from 2mm to 4mm and plot the data -figure 9. figure 9 -lnterferogram scan.from 2mm to 4mm we measure a large spike at around 3.27mm the peak of this spike occurs at the null point we see the plot tail upwards on the right this implies misalignment of the interferometer and will be discus later we observe a large 'spike in amplitude at around 3.27mm we therefore do a slow scan 0.000 l mm/s from 3.265mm to 3.275 a range of0.0 l mm this yield the interferogram show below figure 10 -interferogram of white light over a total range ofo.olmm over the null point we see a semi-gaussian profile peak at 3.27lmm±0.001mm the null point ofour apparatus occurs at 3 27 i mm 0 001 mm this will be the centre of our scan from here onwards we must be careful not to knock the apparatus a the null point be extremely sensitive to the alignment we take an fft of our data in compare this to the theoretical gjaph from literature of a white lead spectrum figure 12 we can draw strong comparison of the shape over the visible spectrum range spectral width in figure jo we have overlaid a gaussian function for the envelope of the spectrum plot in red the sigma of this gaussian be 0.0006mm for white we assume a 1. therefore sigma be the coherence length from equation 7 we find that .dv 7.96 x 10 13 hz substitute this value into equation 8 with a value for il.av of 560nm ± 10nm we get that .da.whit• the approximate fwhm of our fft be measure to be 185nm±snm use equation 10 we obtain a sigma of79nm+ 4nm these value agree with each other to a 4.8 accuracy after complete a successful scan with the white lead we insert a blue lead we do some preliminary scan to get a feel for the coherence length of this new source our final scan be take from 3.262mm to 3.274mm with the null point now at 3 2685mm have move due to distribution of the apparatus a plot of our interferogram be show in figure 13. figure 13 show a neat gaussian distribution of amplitude for the interferogram section ii c tell u to expect the fft to also be gaussian so

this be likely due to a poor approximation of the red gaussian to the envelope function it be possibly too wide the aim of this experiment be to obtain value for the spectral width of three different light source by take detailed interferograms around the null point with an interferometer we want to gain an understand of the physical theory behind the experiment a well a the mathematics support this theory our intention be to compare these width with our expectation and value from literature the white lead and tungsten lamp be perhaps the two most important source that we take data from we expect the tungsten lamp to have a somewhat black-body spectrum which we do obtain we found that the fft of the tungsten interferogram have a large proportion of wavelength within infra-red this suggests that our detector can make measurement of electromagnetic radiation beyond the visible spectrum we found that the blue lead have the short spectral width of the three source measure a expect from it monochromatic appearance this come from the long interferogram with a wide coherence length we could observe interference beyond the first sigma of the gaussian in figure 9 we observe the consequence of a misalignment in the apparatus the general upwards trend of the spectrum indicates that the null point shift with respect to 't for the short range of 't that we take this do not seem to disrupt the result however give more time we would have like to realign the apparatus for more reliable data our fft gaussian plot e.g figure 14 be not smooth this be likely due to insufficient data in the interferogram or anomalous spike in the interferogram due to knock the apparatus 'mid-scan give more time we would take slow scan give more data give the environment of the lab in which we do the experiment it would be difficult to reduce 'knocks of the apparatus and thus anomalous point in the interferogram vi",superficial,the
117,2ndINT_FVA673_Redacted,the interferograms and wavelength distribution of various light source be study use a michelson interferometer and fourier analysis we first set up and tune the interferometer to find the null point use a white lead use the sensitivity-wavelength plot of the detector we be able to approximate the measure curve to a 10th degree polynomial and correct the wavelength distribution of various light source although this curve be only specify between 400-1100 nm the white lead be deduce to be a blue lead with a phosphor coat base on it wavelength distribution but disagreement between the nature of the lead measure and that specify by the manafacturer suggests the sensitivity curve be erroneous the temperature of a tungsten lamp be study by extract the wavelength with maximum spectral radiance and use wien 's law to find the correspond temperature the best available temperature that could be calculate be found to be 2701k attribute the error to the erroneous sensitivity curve and also possibly to impurity in the lamp absorb high wavelength i nterference be a phenomenon in which two wave superimpose to give an interference pattern wherein the result amplitude can be great lesser or equal to the amplitude of the original light wave the image produce be call interferograms the fact that light show an interference pattern be direct proof of the wave nature of light interferometer be device in which one can form interferograms of light source to study the property of the light source the michelson interferometer be one such interferometer wherein a light beam be split into two different perpendicular ray and their path difference can be varied before interference to produce interferograms the michelson interferometer become famous when it be use in the michelson-morley experiment to prove that space be not fill with an aether but rather spaace be empty and light could propagate in vacuum fourier transform spectroscopy be use to analyse the interferograms of various light source this experiment involves the set up of a michelson interferometer search for the null point use a light source that have a narrow enough spatial coherence and analyse the interferograms of various light source to study their wavelength distribution the interferogram be convert to a wavelength distribution use the fast fourier transform package in python issue with circular symmetry have be discus interferometry theory and various result have be discus in far section the mathematical formalism of fourier theory can be apply to investigate the wavelength distribution of the light source base on the intensity spectrum measure use the michelson interferometer it can be show that the fourier transform of a gaussian function be another gaussian function with the spread in their respective space be inversely proportional 1 planck 's law describes the spectral radiance per unit wavelength of a black body a a function of it wavelength and temperature the expression be give by 2 use planck 's law one can relate the wavelength with the maximum spectral radiance to the temperature of the blackbody this relation be approximately give by 2 a tungsten lamp can very accurately model to be a blackbody because it luminescence come from a tungsten coil be heat to a very high temperature and emit visible light hence the temperature of the tungsten lamp can be deduce by inspection of it wavelength distribution there be two type of fringe in an interference pattern haidinger fringe and fizeau fringe haidinger fringe be circular fringe that occur when the mirror be not at equal distance from the beam splitter they be circular because the mirror be exactly perpendicular and the interference have circular symmetry fizeau fringe be slightly more distort fringe that occur because the mirror be not quite perpendicular lead to a loss in circular symmetry typically the interference pattern be a combination of the two type of fringe in the case of haidinger fringe wee can relate the mth bright fringe to it angular distance by the equation 3 where t be be the relative difference of the distance of the mirror from the beam splitter and theta be the angular distance of the mth bright fringe from the center hence we see that for t=0 null point the only solution for m be m=0 hence at the null point we should observe a continuous bright spot and no fringe because the path difference be 0 at all point detail on set up to locate the null point have be discus in the next section haidinger fringe fizeau fringe and a continuous distribution have be displayed below 4 in this experiment we have make the use of a michelson interferometer because it be relatively easy to setup and it be very convenient in it ability to introduce phase difference between wave simply by move one of the mirror a michelson interferometer consists of two mirror m1 and m2 place perpendicular to each other face a beam splitter at an of angle 45°to both the mirror the beam splitter be glass that be partially silver on one side which cause some part of the light to reflect and some part of it to pa through unimpeded the mirror m2 can have it angle tilt to ensure that the mirror be perpendicular and the mirror m1 be fix on a stage with a motor that can alter it distance from the beam splitter and this distance can be change until the ideal fringe pattern be observe the null point corresponds to the point at which m1 and m2 be exactly the same distance from the mirror m1 be then move by various distance to get a distance v intensity plot for our interferogram the detector be a fix photodiode and can detect wavelength between 400 to 1100 nm 5 the setup be illustrate in fig 4. the goal of set up the interferometer be to get haidinger fringe a close to the detector a possible if the mirror be exactly perpendicular to each other we would expect circular symmetry in our fringe but it be not realistically possible to get them exactly perpendicular to each other so will observe fizeau fringe a well the mirror be first place perpendicular to each other and then the beam splitter be place at an appropriate location such that we get circular fringe on a screen use a green laser to do this we rotate the beamsplitter and tilt m2 to get the best possible position the detector be then place a close to the center of the circular fringe a possible the maximum intensity be locate at the null point due to the fact that the green laser have a low wavelength distribution the interference pattern will have a high spatial distribution hence it be difficult to deduce the null point we simply use the green laser to get a range in which the null point could be locate we use a white lead which have a large wavelength distribution to find the exact null point from equation 4 we know the haidinger fringe will move inward a we move toward the null point and outward a we move away if t decrease θ decrease ie the same fringe will be at a small angular distance and appear to move inward a you reduce t. equivalently it will appear to move outward if t increase if the fringe switch from move inward to outward we know that we have cross the null point we can then scan over that small range with the white light to find the exact null point due to very high spatial coherence of white light it be use to find the null point the michelson interferometer be now a very accurate device to study the wavelength distribution of various source although it should be note that the white light be not a collimate beam hence cause difference in intensity a you move the mirror this problem be somewhat well by passing the white light through a lens to collimate it the mirror be then move and the correspond intensity be measure to get the require interferograms the detector in use detects wavelength only between 400-1100 nm with a great than 10 sensitivity it be more sensitive to some wavelength than others the sensitivity against wavelength curve have be displayed below 5 fig 5 sensitivity of the detector a a function of wavelength 5 use an online digitiser several hundred point be extract from the curve a 10th order polynomial be then fit to those data point use the polyfit function in python to define a sensitivity funciton in term of wavelength the amplitude value in the measure data be then divide by their correspond sensitivity value to give the true wavelength distribution note that the sensitivity data be only define between 400-1100 nm so we have not study wavelength outside that range the 10th order polynomial function have be plot below i chose order 10 because the accuracy reduce if an order great or lesser than 10 be chosen the polynomial be give by s − 7.84 × 10 − 24 λ 10 6.13×10 −20 λ 9 − 2.12×10 −16 λ 8 4.25×10 −13 λ 7 − 5.51×10 −10 λ 6 4.81×10 −7 λ 5 − 2.86×10 −4 λ 4 1.15 × 10 −1 λ 3 − 2.98 × 10 1 λ 2 4.51 × 10 3 λ − 3.02 × 10 5 fig 6 10th order polynomial that be model to be the measure sensitivity curve the white lead be use to find the null point because of it high spatial coherence the interference pattern where the null point be clearly visible have be displayed below one way to produce a white lead be to have a blue lead with a phosphor coat some of the blue photon be convert to yellow photon by the phosphor coat this combination of blue and yellow light appear white to our eye 6 we know that this be a blue lead coat with phosphor because upon inspection of fig 8 we see two peak at approximately 450 nm and 590 nm these correspond to blue-violet and yellow light respectively it be obvious that the spread in distribution come from a yellow phosphor coat because of the large spectral width around 590 nm the lead be a warm white lead for it relatively large peak at yellow than blue however information from the manafacturer say that the lead be meant to be a cold white lead rather than a warm white lead 7 which mean that we 'd expect a high peak at blue this suggests that the sensitivity curve be possibly erroneous and do not correctly account for the detector 's sensitivity to various wavelength this hypothesis be far support in the study of the tungsten lamp in the next subsection the interferogram of the tungsten source have be plot it be also a white light hence we expect large spatial coherence the tungsten source be investigate due to the fact that it behaves like a blackbody the amplitude measure rise very sharply at value close to 1100 nm this be possibly erroneous because it lead to a very strong deviation from planck 's law so for the scope of tungsten we will deduce it temperature use the uncorrected data the wavelength correspond to the high spectral density from the uncorrected data be found to be 897.71 nm then use equation 3 the temperature of the tungsten lamp be calculate to be 3228k this be well below tungsten 's melt point of 3695k but we know that that tungsten lamp have a more typical temperature in the range of 2000-3000k 8 to get to the bottom of the source of error we will investigate the temperature correspond to the correct wavelength distribution the wavelength with the large spectral radiance in the correct distribution be measure to be 1073.1 nm from equation 3 this corresponds to a temperature of 2701k this be a more likely temperature of the tungsten lamp hence we can deduce that the odd behaviour of the wavelength distribution might not be due to the sensitivity-wavelength curve of the detector be erroneous but rather the error be intrinsic to the tungsten lamp itself this could possibly be because of impurity or the gas that fill the lamp that be absorb high wavelength give the fickle nature of the source of error the calculate temperature 2701k be likely not a good representation of the behaviour of the tungsten lamp we also see that a large part of the energy produce by the tungsten lamp be emit in the infrared region which be not visible which mean that the usage of tungsten lamp lead to a large wastage of energy we have successfully use fourier transform spectroscopy to analyse the interferograms of a white lead and a tungsten lamp which be nearly continuous white light source a michelson interferometer be setup to generate these interferograms follow which the fast fourier transform package in python be use to generate the wavelength distribution from the interferograms the white lead have a nearly continuous distribution with two local wavelength peak correspond to 450 nm and 590 nm this implies that the white lead be indeed a blue lead with a phosphor coat to generate blue and yellow photon which when combine appear white to the human eye the tungsten lamp be approximate to a black body but due to issue that be likely intrinsic to the lamp or because of the abrupt decrease in sensitivity near 1100 nm the temperature of the lamp could not be deduce for sure but base on prior knowledge of likely temperature of a tungsten lamp the peak wavelength of 1073.1 nm be the best possible value we have obtain from the correct wavelength distribution which corresponds to a temperature of 2701 k. the inaccuracy of the wavelength distribution around the infrared region make it impossible to accurately quantify property of the lamp like it efficiency although we see that most of it energy be in the infrared this experiment could be improve if fourier spectroscopy could be conduct in the infrared region also it be likely that the sensitivity curve be incorrect so an update and correct sensitivity curve would be helpful in obtain well and more trustworthy result some detector also give relatively noisy data for equivalent data set this could possibly have lead to some imperfect deduction of peak wavelenghts and hence offset result,superficial,bal
118,2ndINT_QMC249_Redacted,in this report we investigate the physic behind two different light source namely light emit diode lead and a white light tungsten source this be do by utilise a michelson interferometer we then examine the interferograms of each light source from which the mean wavelength and the spectral width for each light source be found by take a fast fourier transform t here exists many different type of light source and not surprisingly many of them operate differently and be govern by different physical law or process one of the light source most commonly use today be light emit diode lead lead be know for it high energy efficiency compact size and improve lifetime amongst other advantage it be therefore not a surprise that lead have widespread application range from traffic light to electronic display another type of light source be incandescent lamp which have be around for much longer compare to lead and be have a comparatively high energy consumption in this experiment lead and an incandescent lamp with a tungsten filament be use a the source for a michelson interferometer the position of one of the mirror be varied to obtain an interferogram by take a fast fourier transform fft of the interferograms the spectral distribution of the light come from each source be able to be obtain with the spectral distribution we be able to characterise each light source by find their mean wavelength peak wavelength and spectral width very simply an lead work by electron in a semiconductor move from a high energy 'conduction band into electron hole an empty state where an electron can exist within a low energy 'valence band in response to a current passing through the lead this result in the emission of a photon with an energy correspond to band gap of the semiconductor which be the energy difference between the maximum of the valence band and the minimum of the conduction band the wavelength of the photon emit follow the simple relation where ∆e be the band gap of the semiconductor h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light in a vacuum and λ be the wavelength of the photon emit on the other hand an incandescent lamp work by heating a filament to a temperature high enough such that the filament begin to emit visible light a such they can be model a a blackbody which be an idealise surface that can theoretically absorb all incoming radiation a blackbody emits blackbody radiation a continuous spectrum of light mathematically described by planck 's radiation law where i λ t be the spectral emittance of the blackbody unit w m −3 which be the intensity per unit wavelength λ be wavelength t be the absolute temperature of the blackbody h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light in a vacuum and k b be the boltzmann constant fig 1 show illustrates the general shape of a blackbody emit blackbody radiation we can integrate across all possible wavelength to find the total radiate intensity to obtain the stefan-boltzmann law which state that the total intensity i radiate by a blackbody be proportional to the fourth power of the blackbody 's absolute temperature where σ another law govern blackbody radiation be wien 's displacement law which relates the peak wavelength λ peak emit by a blackbody with it absolute temperature and be give by where b be a constant know a wien 's wavelength displacement law constant and have a value of the michelson interferometer setup be show in fig 2. if an observer view the mirror at an angle θ a show in fig 3 then the angle θ at which constructive interference occurs can be related to t the distance by which a moveable mirror move by the equation where m be an integer know a the order of interference a proof of this be give in appendix a. if t 0 then the left hand side of equation 8 be zero but this mean that co θ can take any value and so constructive interference should occur at all value of θ therefore the intensity a measure by the detector should be at a maximum this be know a the 'null point i.e the point at which t 0. a fourier transform decomposes a superposition into it constituent part whilst give the relative contribution of each part this be illustrate in fig 4. in this experiment the interferogram be the superposition so the fourier transform allows u to obtain the spectral distribution of the light source and find out which individual wavelength contribute the most to the light emit by the source one convention for write the fourier transform be a follow where f f x represent a fourier transform operate on f x whereas g ω be the fourier transform of f x note that this be the continuous fourier transform the interferogram be make up of discrete point so in reality a discrete fourier transform be take the interferometer be first setup a show in fig 2 and then place such that mirror 1 and 2 m1 and m2 be a close a possible to equidistant from the beam splitter mirror 2 be fix onto a moveable linear stage and so be use to vary t. alignment of the interferometer be do use a green laser and lens while the mirror would be carefully adjust this would make sure the mirror be parallel and perpendicular with the source and detector when the interferometer be properly align circular fringe know a haidinger fringe would appear and be make to be centre at the detector the green laser be then switch for a white lead and the lens would be remove the next step be to find the null point of the interferometer which be do by move m2 slowly over a certain range until a spike in the interferogram be found four interferograms be then take about the null point at a speed of 0.001 mm s −1 this be repeat for a blue lead a tungsten white light source a well a the same tungsten light source with a green filter add although the gain on the detector have to be increase for the tungsten source since the emit light have less intensity compare to the lead a fast fourier transform fft be take of each of these interferograms use the interferograms and their ffts the mean wavelength and spectral width be found for each source mean wavelength be calculate use three different method the first be to assume that the interferogram and it fft would be approximately gaussian so the mean wavelength would be equal to the peak wavelength the second be to take a weight mean base on the spectral distribution produce by the fft this be do use the formula where i λ be the spectral emittance for a give wavelength λ. the third and last method be to look at the interferogram about the null point and measure the distance between adjacent peak due to the factor of 2 in 8 the mean wavelength would be twice that distance for purpose of reduce random error the mean wavelength be calculate by take the two peak which be five peak away from the null point measure the distance between them and divide by 10. specifically if p i be the ith peak from the null point where in this notation the null point would be p 0 and λ pi be the wavelength correspond to peak p i then the mean wavelength would be give by the spectral width of each source be found by simply find the full width at half maximum fwhm of the spectral distribution produce by the fft a. result and error 1 mean wavelength table 1 show the value for the mean wavelength for each light source calculate use the three method outline in the method section blue lead 32±1 tungsten source with green filter 40±4 2 spectral width table 2 show the value for the spectral width for the lead and the tungsten source whereas for the tungsten source with a green filter it show it value for the spectral width of the green filter 3 tungsten filament temperature by plug the peak wavelength for the tungsten source in table 1 into 6 we can now estimate the temperature of the tungsten filament and so have an estimate value of t 3560 ± 9 k. appendix b and c contains sample interferograms and spectral distribution obtain by the fourier transform respectively from each of the light source the white lead have value for the mean wavelength in generally the 500-600 nm range which be to be expect consider the visible light spectrum range from about 380 to 750 nm which implies a mean wavelength of about 565 nm on the other hand the blue lead have value at around 450 nm a well a a low 414 nm use a wavelength to colour calculator we can see that 414 nm corresponds to violet whereas 450 nm be dark blue this be contrary to the lead which be a light blue colour and should correspond to about 480 nm the tungsten white light source show a mean wavelength of about 810 nm which be actually outside of the visible light spectrum but this be not too surprising if we recall that the tungsten source can be model a a blackbody and so would radiate wavelength outside of the visible spectrum moreover since the distribution in planck 's law be positively skewed we would expect that the mean wavelength would become big which be what we obtain the tungsten white light source with the green filter have a peak wavelength of about 530-540 nm which be just about what be expect since the wavelength range corresponds to a light green but it have a mean wavelength of 2200 nm which be outside the visible spectrum if we look at fig 14 in appendix b which show the spectral distribution we see that there be a significant contribution from high wavelength besides the peak wavelength which positively skews the mean wavelength result in the high result for the mean wavelength in regard to the spectral width we have found that the blue lead and the tungsten source with the green filter have the small spectral width follow by the white lead and then the tungsten source this be not unexpected since the blue lead and filter tungsten source would emit mostly light of a narrow range of wavelength whereas the others would emit white light which span a great range of wavelength and so they would have a large spectral width moreover the tungsten source have a large spectral width compare to the white lead because once again the tungsten source can be model a a blackbody and so it emits a great range of wavelength compare to the white lead which be constrain by the band gap of the semiconductor we estimate the temperature of the tungsten filament of the tungsten source to be about 3560 k. note that this be below tungsten 's melt point of about 3687 k so this obtain temperature be plausible other estimate place the temperature at around 3000 k it should be note that the interferograms obtain with the white lead be consistently asymmetric see fig 6 in appendix b this may be an indicator of an imperfect alignment of the michelson interferometer imperfection such a dirt on the laser or faulty electronics but another thing to not be that the spectral distribution show in fig 10 in appendix c show a double peak this may mean that it be likely a fault in the lead 's electronics perhaps brought about by a fault in the manufacturing process or the lead sustain some damage in response to a physical shock or a high current passing through it we have see that the result of the interferometry experiment largely conform to what be expect base on the theory behind these light source for instance the tungsten source spectral distribution show in fig 12 resembles the planck 's law distribution show in fig 1. in addition the mean wavelength largely conform to what be expect base on the colour of the light emit we also show that a tungsten source have a large spectral width compare to an lead which implies that more energy be waste in the tungsten source through production of wavelength outside the visible spectrum moreover the obtain estimate for the temperature of the tungsten filament be also within the range of plausibility it can be conclude that incandescent lamp be inferior to lead since the former waste comparatively more energy through the emission of wavelength in the infrared spectrum a well a have a less well define spectral distribution compare to lead in fig 5 it can be see that the extra distance the low ray travel compare to the upper ray be 2α − β. use some trigonometry α and β can be show to be consider the path difference be an integer number m of wavelength for constructive interference we obtain mλ 2t co θ a require many thanks to andrew lee for his assistance in carry out the experiment,extended,bal
119,2ndINT_UGX035_Redacted,the wavelength spectrum of white lead blue lead and tungsten source be found use the michelson interferometer setup a a fourier transform spectrometer the aim of the experiment be to explore the characteristic of light source whilst investigate the effectiveness of the apparatus the white lead blue lead and tungsten source with a yellow filter have wavelength of 522.0 nm 490.4 nm and 574.0 nm with negligible error these result agree with the accepted range despite their complex distribution the result be not quite precise which highlight how appropriate a gaussian fit might have be the main reason for inaccuracy be the background disturbance and misalignment t he michelson interferometer be an important device in spectroscopy it provide a path way for light along which it split into two beam with different path the beam then recombine to produce interference pattern the variation in path length be due to a movable stage which process on a scale low than millimetre combine this with the fact that light in the visible region be on the nanometre scale this mean the michelson interferometer be an incredibly precise instrument that be delicate because calibration be key to it functionality exploit the property of this setup allows wavelength spectrum of different light source to be explore by combine it with fourier transform theory in addition to these the michelson interferometer have real world application particularly in astrophysics in which the refractive index of gas and the spectrum of star can be determine 1 fringe occur in interferometry due to repeat constructive and destructive interference which produce alternate dark and bright line the michelson interferometer which be displayed in fig 2 undergoes interference through the variation in the distance from the null point this result in a path difference between the two arm of the interferometer a one beam of light travel far than the other if the mirror be parallel the two wave will appear to be come from a source at infinity because the beam be always parallel this result in circular haidinger fringe a the symmettry be cylindrical if the mirror be n't parallel the source be effectively at a finite position close to the mirror so straight fizeau fringe occur these be drawn in fig 1. constructive interference occurs when the path difference be an integer number of wavelength a the two wave be in phase and this rule give rise to equation s1 where ∆r be the path difference θ be the angle to the horizontal and λ. light can be model a a sinusoidal plane wave in this case the angle θ be 0 o meaning the path difference be twice the distance move by the stage a the beam move through that distance twice upon reflection the variation of path difference give an interference pattern which will be characteristic for different wavelength spectrum change the arm length of the interferometer allows an arbitrary spectrum to be plot in which intensity varies with distance from the null point the space in which the intensity be plot can have it dependence change through the use of a fourier transform a show by equation 2 the reversal of this can be perform use the inverse fourier transform in equation 3 the fringe present on the interferogram follow the shape of a gaussian or similar to it which when transform by definition will give a gaussian shape too a equation 4 show transform the fringe into an electromagnetic spectrum will change the shape of gaussian inversely a demonstrate by equation 5. this be because a narrower gaussian will give a wider one and vice vers a the standard deviation be change 2 where the standard deviation of the transform gaussian be the spectral line can be express in frequency and wavelength space in both they be position at a mean value these line have a spectral width which be a measure of the range of value correspond to that line the interferogram which be a plot of intensity against distance or time be in the time domain so can be express a f t a fourier transform yield the spectral line which be in the frequency domain express a f ω the mathematical process can be carry out in python which involves a fast fourier transform algorithm in which the interferogram be transform into intensity against oscillation per step this can then be reconstruct into a wavelength spectrum the coherence length be the range over which the contrast be readable on the interferogram therefore it be the distance over which the sinusoidal wave be distinct the spectral width ∆ν be related to this length by equation 6 where c be the speed of light equation 7 show how the guassian envelop of an interferogram have a fwhm that relates to the coherence length a this be the standard deviation the spectral width be related to the wavelength spectrum through equation 9 where λ be the wavelength 3 the whole interferometer be set up in a black optical enclosure with cover prevent unwanted light from enter the experiment therefore reduce the background intensity during the setup and the experiment care be take with the optical equipment to ensure that it be not scratch or have no fingerprint a these would affect the path of the light and their intensity it be also clean with a fluid before use to far ensure this furthemore additional care be take not to knock any apparatus a any slight movement would affect the alingments a well a strict precaution to avoid look directly at light source .. the michelson interferometer be construct on a stage a illustrate in fig 2. the system be kept a compact a possible with short distance to increase the accuracy a ruler be use to keep everything at the same height one mirror be place on a fix stage that could move adjacent to this be a beam splitter that be position at the middle of the interferometer another fix mirror be clamped onto the platform adjacent to the beam splitter it be tilt to ensure the alignment give clear fringe the source be also position directly opposite the mirror the detector be place close to the beam splitter the beam splitter consists of a partially-silvered mirror which split the source into two beam at right angle to one another a well a a dielectric plate which applies a phase change to a beam and recombines it with the other lens be use to broaden and sharpen the source upon enter the beam splitter and the detector the light source be cast on a distant screen with a dark background for the alignment procedure to ensure the overlap be accurate and the circle be large this be do by tilt the mirror it be also ensure the beam be focus centrally on the beam splitter the null point be the point at which maximum constructive interference occurs a the arm of the interferometer be the same length the null point be significant a it be around this point that the information of the source be best found a interference and coherence be great the stage and detector be operate use linux and three command be give to them these include the position in millitres to where the stage be to be move the speed in millimetre per second at which it would move and the number of reading for the detector to take thorlab be also use in conjuction with the detector so that the plot could be view in a live plot a quick scan be take of the whole range with a green laser to view the overall profile of the interferogram and highlight potential region of where the null point might be the variation of the distance from the null point cause the fringe to move a the interference be different move towards the null point will cause fringe to move inwards and outwards if move away from it the stage be scan in one direction in interval of a millimetre until it be found that the direction of fringe movement change between -4mm and -3mm the region be scan more slowly with the same green laser and the region be narrow down to a 0.2 mm range from -3.2 to -3.0 mm the laser 's interferogram also spike around this region measurement be take by move the stage quickly back to the position of -3.2mm the region be then scan with the command of -3.08 mm at 0.002 mm/s and 50000 reading to ensure enough be take the gain be reduce on the detector for these source a they have low intensity so this would allow more distinct reading to be take with less background error additional card be also place around the apparatus inside the box to reduce background source the experiment be carry out in a dark laboratory with minimal light to far ensure this caution be take to prevent additional vibration that might have affected reading initially the interferograms be found to be slant upwards this would have be do misalignment a the mirror stage could have not be be perfectly horizontal and cause be get closer therefore reduce ... a ground lens be use with the white lead so that it could be diffuse and appear more uniform a yellow filter be use with the tungsten light 4 the measurement of the spectrum be record by the detector which have a sample rate of 50hz and be move at a speed of 0.002mm/s this meant that the distance between sample be 0.08µm this be input into the fast fourier transform and reconstruct to give the wavelength spectrum a gaussian be plot a an envelop on the interferogram and fit to the wavelength spectrum the fwhm could be found manually from these gaussians to find the coherence length use equation 7. the use of equation 6 then allow the spectral width to be found the mean wavelength be found by zoom in for example a in fig 3 and take an average of the sinusoidal wave produce within the interferogram the combination of all these result then allow the wavelength spread to be found use equation 8. the result obtain via this manual method be all summarise in table i. the error be found to be negligible due to the calcualtions be on the millimetre scale the plot of a gaussian to the wavelength spectrum in fig 5 give a wavelength and standard deviation of 571.9nm and 71.6nm respectively this be not concordant with the manual result found of 522.0nm but it be much closer to the mean value of the visible spectrum which be 560nm so it be accurate both the interferogram and the spectrum do n't appear to exhibit a gaussian distribution exactly this be found mainly to do with how white lead be construct they be often construct with a mix of blue and yellow light which give a white colour that have a distribution across many colour despite this the blue peak be still distinct this mean that the wavelength spectrum appear to have a double peak with one in the blue region and the other in the yellow region the second peak be high than the first which suggests that the lead be quite hot at different temperature the peak shift 5 fig 5. the white lead wavelength spectrum which exhibit a gaussian like shape but not a perfect one a there be an additional peak in the blue region furthermore for a black-body spectrum wien 's displacement law can be apply in which the wavelength when peak intensity occurs varies inversely with temperature spectral radiance be proportional to intensity so this seem appropriate to apply to the wavelength spectrum t λ peak 2.898 × 10 −3 mk this mean that this lead be at a temperature of 5084 k. this seem extremely high and resembles that of a star so the blackbody spectrum be not match by this lead the blue lead give the best fit to a gaussian distribution a show in fig 6 both the interferogram and the wavelength spectrum be gaussian in nature this be because the blue lead can be compose such that it contains only blue light unlike the white light the blue lead fit give a mean wavelength and standard deviation of 462.7nm and 12.0nm respectively this do not agree with the manual method value of 490.4nm however both lie in the accepted value range of 435-500nm an attempt be also make to model this like a black-body this meany the blue lead be at an effective temperature of 6272k which be high compare to the white lead this be justifiable consider the lead get warm the tungsten source have a yellow filter therefore only certain frequency could be obtain in the spectrum and the wavelength spectrum have many spike a fig 9 show a blue lead wavelength spectrum which exhibit a narrower gaussian shape to it interferogram traditionally a filter can be model a a top-hat function which would then be fourier transform into a sinc function which the envelop on fig 8 display 6 fitting a gaussian to the wavelength spectrum give a wavelength and standard deviation of 563.3nm and 15.2nm respectively this only differs from the manual result of 574.0nm found by 2.0 so it be fairly precise it be also accurate a yellow light have an accepted range of 565-590nm the source also all peaked at the same null point highlight the importance of it the gaussian envelop could be fit on all the interferograms allow the parameter in table i to be found despite this it be n't necessarily appropriate for the white lead a the shape have some distortion due to the additional spike at the blue region it be almost a if subtract fig 9. the tungsten with a yellow filter have a wavelegnth spectrum with many spike this be due to the filter cut off certain wavlengths it bares some resemblance to a square top-hat function but it be not perfect a the filter be n't ideal the lead both have accuracy with the method use to calculate their parameter however they lack precision which suggests they may both not necessarily be gaussian there be also limitation to the use of a blackbody spectrum a it may not be directly in thermodynamic equilibrium with it surroundings so the approximation would break down hence why the temperature found be not realistic they be however useful for the comparison of the peak in the white lead spectrum the tungsten filter exhibit the correct shape of a sinc function which result from the filter 7 in conclusion the michelson interferometer prove to be a useful device in study the spectrum of light it allow the wavelength of distribution to be found without deviation from the range of accepted value despite this there be source of error in this which include how truly uniform the sample rate be a there be no guarantee that the reading be take with even distance apart the background intensity be still present despite the effort make to darken the area this would have be due to dark source such a stray electron therefore the experiment could be carry out in a vacuum or gas chamber furthermore the spectrum be found in general to be more conplicated that a guassian so fourier transfroms of other more complex function such a the boltzmann-distribution could have be explore a potential curve fit overall the michelson interferometer be important for explore many physical phenomenon on an atomic scale meaning that this fourier transform spectrometer be vital to study light spectrum,extended,exp
120,2ndINT_MJV182_Redacted,this investigation explores the use of a michelson interferometer to perform spectroscopy on various light source to deduce their characteristic after construct the michelson interferometer interferograms be record for each light source then the fourier transform take for each signal to produce their wavelength spectrum from these coherence length spectral width and peak wavelength value be obtain to characterise each source the white light sources-the tungsten lamp and the white led-had the large spectral width correspond to these contain wavelength across the entire visible light spectrum the tungsten lamp through assumption a a black body be found to operate at a temperature of 3430±20 k and the spectral sensitivity of the detector be found to have a considerable but correctable convolution effect on the spectrum for source with filter apply the spectral data could not be accurately evaluate a the signal intensity be too low in relation to the background light present far extension to this experiment could investigate an experimental modification to increase signal intensity for the filter source an investigation into the dispersion effect of the medium in the interferometer and fitting different type of curve to the interferogram and spectral data to find the most accurate fit to these shape t he michelson interferometer be devise in 1887 by the physicist albert a. michelson and edward w. morley to attempt to prove the existence of a lumniferous aether through which light wave travel 1 despite unanimously disprove this theory their interferometer have ultimately have a much wider impact on experimental physic prevail right through to modern physic with the 2015 observation of gravitational wave make use an advanced michelson interferometer ligo 2 since the output of interferometry an interferogram be dependent on the frequency of the input wave these can be analyse use fourier theory to discover the incident frequency hence perform spectroscopy on the input this experiment aim to construct a work michelson interferometer and use it to analyse the spectral composition of various electromagnetic source by take the fourier transform of their interferograms hence deduce the wavelength spectrum compose each source a show by the ray diagram in figure 1 the michelson interferometer u a beam-splitter-in the form of a partiallysilvered mirror-to split an incident beam into two perpendicular beam of equal intensity these beam be each reflect back towards the beam-splitter where they partially reflect and recombine again to produce a superposition beam of the two split beam propagate away at 90 • to the incidence angle of the source it be evident that the two beam interfere when recombine with the interference pattern dependent on the difference in optical path length of the two interferometer arm this be easy to visualise for a plane-wave monochromatic light source-if the path length be the same or differ by integer multiple of the source 's wavelength λ the recombine beam will be in phase with each other and constructively interfere if the path length differ by λ 2 the recombine beam will be exactly out of phase and deconstructively interfere the beamsplitter use in this experiment have a dielectric coat on one side cause one of the beam to undergo a phase change this be such that instead destructive interference occurs when the arm be of equal length the position of the movable mirror for equal optical path length know a the 'null point hence by vary the position of the movable mirror the wavelength-or more generally the wavelength spectrum-of the source can be precisely measure the type of interference fringe see at the output depends on the collimation of the source and the alignment of the interferometer for a perfectly collimate plane-wave light source and assume perfect alignment of the interferometer the interfere beam will be align with each other and their interference will be uniform throughout the output however since perfect collimation be difficult and not particularly useful it be necessary to consider an extend source where the incidence angle θ of the ray will vary assume perfect right-angled alignment of the interferometer and placement of the source in respect to it optical axis there will be a cylindrical symmetry of the beam along the optical ax hence the fringe in the interference pattern will arise only at certain value of θ where t be the position of the mirror from the null point and m be any integer this effectuates circular 'haidinger fringe around the optical axis center if the interferometer be not perfectly align the symmetry around the optical axis be broken result in linear parallel equal-thickness 'fizeau fringe fourier theory be the principle that any function or signal can be represent a a superposition of sinusoidal function by calculate this sum of sinusoid an original signal can be transform into a domain define by the frequency of these sinusoid this be the 'fourier transform where f be the mathematical operator for the fourier transform if f x be a function in the spatial domain f k be a function in the spatial frequency domain conversely a function in the spatial domain can be retrieve by take the inverse fourier transform denote by f −1 of a function in the spatial frequency domain without any information lose consequently if information about a signal be store in the form of it fourier transform the inverse fourier transform can be apply to return the original signal 3 such pair function be term fourier transform pair notable example include a sinusoid and a dirac delta function centre at the sinusoidal frequency or two gaussian function with interrelate width again consider a monochromatic source in the michelson interferometer the overall intensity of the output signal f varies with path length x where k be the wavenumber 2π λ of the monochromatic source and i 0 be the average intensity of each split beam extend this for a source emit a continuous spectrum of wavelength e k the interference signal from an infinitesimal spectral element dk will be integrate over the entire spectrum of frequency and subtract out the constant term 2 define e −k e k for mathematical simplicity where i x and e k be a fourier transform pair hence by record a source 's interferogram the fourier transform of this return the spectral composition of the source 4 a the range of wavelength in a source increase it be define to have a large spectral width ∆ν correspond to a narrower coherence length l by where c be the speed of light this width enumerates the range of frequency present in light source common light source include filament lamp lead laser and gas discharge lamp each have a different method of generate light and consequently a different spectral composition a peak in a wavelength spectrum of light be conventionally call a 'spectral line 1 filament lamp filament lamp emit light by passing an electric current through a metal filament usually tungsten heating it to high temperature since these metal generally act a black body radiator the thermal energy be emit a black body radiation 5 the majority of this electromagnetic radiation be in the infrared region of the spectrum however the light produce in the visible range be relatively continuous and appear a white light wien 's displacement law relates the peak wavelength in the spectrum λ peak to the temperature t of the filament 2 lead since there be no such thing a an single lead which emits purely white light there be two conventional method to simulate white light the first method the 'rgb configuration u a red blue and green lead close together simulate a continuous spectrum over the visible light range it spectrum have three clear peak at the wavelength of red blue and green light the other type u a single shortwavelength led-usually blue-along with a phosphorous coat the coat absorbs some of the shorter wavelength light and emits it at longer wavelength thus white light be simulated from the combination of the narrower shortwavelength spectral line from the blue lead and the wider longer-wavelength phosphorescence line 6 3 gas discharge lamp gas discharge lamp emit light by passing an electric field through an ionise gas cause electron in the gas to be excite to high energy state when the electron return to their pre-excited energy level they emit this energy difference in the form of electromagnetic light of a wavelength λ inversely-proportional to the energy gap ∆e between the excite and unexcited state where h be planck 's constant hence the spectrum of such a light source depends on the atomic structure of the specific gas 7 for a mercury gas discharge lamp this result in spectral line at wavelength of 405 436 546 and 579 nm 11 on an optical table the interferometer be construct a in figure 1 where a non-adjustable mirror be place on a motorise stage to effectuate the movable mirror and a photo-diode detector use to measure the output signal the other mirror be kinematic allow for adjustment to align the apparatus and a clamp be use to secure the source in position the component be place relatively close together to ease the alignment process and ensure the signal incident on the detector have a great enough intensity to align the interferometer a green laser be use due to it large coherence length and be monochromatic meaning the interference fringe be easily visible to the human eye first the beam be roughly align by overlap the path of the beam at various point in the optical path then the kinematic mirror use to fine-tune the alignment until haidinger fringe be visible on a screen place in front of the detector-indicating perfect alignment with the motorise stage and the detector control by command from the linux terminal the interferogram of a source could be digitally record a linear gradient in the background intensity value of this interferogram indicate an alignment imperfection in which case the alignment procedure be repeat until this gradient be minimise since the coherence length be much small for other source than the green laser the interferogram be only detectable over a very short range of mirror position around the null point this require the mirror position for the null point to be accurately know around the null point the number of fringe present in the interference pattern reduces to a minimum thus use the green laser to produce visible fringe the mount mirror be position at 1mm interval across it range from -10mm to 10mm and the number of fringe count at each point this narrow down the search range to within a millimetre replace the green laser with a white lead with a rough coherence length of 10μm the interferogram be scan over this range detect the mirror position of the interference pattern centre to a precision of around 5 micron the source analyse with the interferometer be a white and a blue lead a tungsten lamp with and without a yellow filter and a mercury gas discharge lamp with a green then a yellow filter the interferograms be scan for each source across the null point over a mirror position range of 50μm at a stage speed of 0.5μm/s this speed be kept low to increase the spatial sample frequency hence prevent any beating effect in the interferogram for the tungsten lamp with the filter and the mercury lamp in general the signal be too weakly diffuse after propagate through the interferometer to detect a notable signal at the detector to recify this a plano-convex lens be use between the beam-splitter and the detector to increase the intensity of the signal on the detector for these source analyse the interferograms of the source a gaussian curve be plot onto the amplitude of each interferogram from which the coherence length and subsequently the spectral width of each source could be calculate the fourier transform of each interferogram be then take to produce their wavelength spectrum since the sensitivity of the photodiode detector varies with wavelength the spectrum obtain from the source will be convolute with this function a function be fit to approximate this spectral sensitivity which be use to deconvolute the signal and return correct spectrum for the lead and the mercury lamp the peak wavelength of the spectrum be deduce by assume the spectral line to be gaussian curve for the tungsten lamp the spectrum be analyse a black body radiation curve by approximate the peak wavelength of the spectrum the temperature of the tungsten lamp be estimate by apply wien 's law the interferograms for the white lead figure 2 blue lead figure 3 and unfiltered tungsten figure 4 be show below with gaussian curve fit to their amplitude where σ be the width of each gaussian the interferograms record for the filter tungsten lamp and mercury lamp do not show a clear increase in amplitude to which a curve could be plot to find the coherence length take the fourier transform of the interferograms give wavelength spectrum for the blue lead figure 5 white lead figure 7 unfiltered tungsten lamp figure 8 tungsten lamp with the yellow filter figure 9 and the mercury lamp with yellow and green filter figure 10 these spectrum be correct to account for the spectral sensitivity of the detector by devise a function show in figure 6 to approximate the photodiode sensitivity provide in it function sheet 8 this be use to deconvolute the signal and return correct wavelength spectrum note that the white lead spectrum have a sharper peak in the blue wavelength range and a wider peak within the longer wavelength it appear to be configure in the form of a blue lead with a phosphor coat compare this white lead spectrum before and after correction figure 7 show the blue peak 's amplitude become large than that of the phosphor peak be similar to other find 9 this show the deconvoluted spectrum be more accurate to the real source spectrum the key characteristic of each light source be show in table i with the spectral width value calculate use equation 9. the lack of coherence length and spectral width data for the yellow-filtered tungsten lamp and mercury lamp be due to the lack of a pattern in their interferograms this meant a curve could n't be fit to derive coherence length value and hence spectral width value the value could have instead be calculate from the source spectrum however these show only approximate spectral peak a reason for this low-quality data could be an issue with the alignment of the interferometer however consider this alignment work for the other three source the issue be more likely due to the low intensity of these source configuration on the detector-these source be those with a weaker signal a mention in 'method the spectrum for the unfiltered tungsten lamp figure 8 after correction for the detector 's spectral sensitivity resembles that of a black body radiator with a peak in the visible spectrum at 845±5 nm apply wien 's law this corresponds to a temperature of 3430±20 k. this be a typical value for the operating temperature of a tungsten lamp affirm that the black body assumption be valid 10 the spectrum for the tungsten lamp with a yellow filter figure 9 show a wide noisy spectral line centre approximately around 580nm a expect this wavelength correlate to yellow light this spectrum be likely to be a convolution of the overall tungsten spectrum figure 8 with a filter function limited to the yellow spectral range the derive mercury lamp spectrum with the respective filter show peak in the mercury spectrum at approximately 550nm and 580nm this be roughly consistent with the know emission spectrum of mercury which contains spectral line at 546nm and 578nm 11 however the high level of noise and the fact the two spectrum overlap considerably mean the determination of these value be ambiguous at the least a with the tungsten lamp the derive mercury spectrum be likely to be convolution of the general mercury spectrum with the respective spectral filter of the green and yellow filter a see in table i the tungsten lamp and white lead have large spectral width small coherence length than the blue lead this figure a these be white light source contain a wide range of light frequency in the visible spectrum whereas the blue lead only contains frequency in the blue spectral range this be back up by the derive spectrum which show tungsten and the white lead a span the entire visible light range whereas the blue lead spectrum only span a range of 100nm from their spectrum the filter tungsten and mercury data appear to span a narrower electromagnetic range i.e small spectral width which be logical a these be only filter region of the source spectrum the error in the coherence length value and the peak wavelength of the blue lead white lead and tungsten lamp be found from the covariance matrix of the gaussians fit to the spectral line and the amplitude of the interferograms these error reflect that a gaussian fit be only an approximation of the shape to far investigate the shape other curve such a a lorentzian could be fit for comparison the error in the spectral width and the temperature of the tungsten lamp be found through error propagation from the error in the coherence length and peak temperature of the unfiltered tungsten lamp the dispersion of light within the various medium of the interferometer be n't account for in the data analysis of this experiment spread out different wavelength and hence affect the detect signal any dispersion would need to be fully investigate to ensure accuracy of the derive spectral data a michelson interferometer be succesfully built and implement to charcterise various light source the white light sources-the tungsten lamp and the white led-were found to have the large spectral width correspond to these contain wavelength across the entire visible light spectrum the tungsten lamp be found to operate at a temperature of 3430±20 k and the spectral sensitivity of the detector be found to have a considerable but correctable convolution effect on the spectrum for source with filter apply the spectral data could not be accurately evaluate a the signal intensity be too low in relation to the background light present far extension to this experiment could investigate an experimental modification to increase signal intensity for the filter source an investigation into the dispersion effect of the medium in the interferometer or fitting different type of curve to the interferogram and spectral data to find the most accurate fit to these shape,extended,exp
121,2ndINT_AAN562_Redacted,michelson interferometer be construct and use to obtain the interferograms of various light source namely a white lead a tungsten source and a mercury vapor lamp a fast fourier transform be later perform on these interferograms to obtain the spectrum of these light source use this spectroscopy method we determine the characteristic a well a composition of the light source which we investigate the white lead and tungsten source be observe to be light source with continuous wavelength spectrum while the mercury lamp source emit light at discrete wavelength these observation be consistent with the physic behind the emission of light from the source lead 's have energy band within them while a tungsten source behaves a a black body radiation emitter and the mercury lamp emits light through atomic transition the michelson interferometer prove to be precise in examine the light source although there be a few limitation and source of error due to the restriction of equipment and compute power with improvement to the equipment and more compute power the michelson interferometer could be use for more advanced application such a high resolution spectroscopy i nterferometry be a method of superimpose wave upon one another to create an interference pattern from which information can be obtain a famous experiment in which interferometry be use be the 'failed michelson-morley experiment from which light be proven to have a constant speed in all frame and from which the foundation of einstein 's postulate of special relativity could be laid the interferometer when combine with fourier transforms essentially becomes a spectrometer this be a very powerful technique that allows u to obtain and study the spectrum of light source with this method we could for example analyse the spectrum of astronomical body and predict their composition 2 in this experiment a michelson interferometer be construct and use to obtain the interference pattern or interferograms of several light source fast fourier transforms be then apply to the interferograms to obtain the spectrum of the light source which we then use to study the characteristic of the light source the layout of the michelson interferometer be show in fig 1. a light source emits light which be split into two beam when incident upon the beam splitter the two beam be then reflect by mirror m1 and m2 back into the beam splitter where they recombine and be direct towards a photodetector which measure the intensity of the recombine light beam in the michelson interferometer the beam splitter consists of a dielectric plate which induces a phase change of π 2 on one of the beam assume a monochromatic light source of wavelength λ there be destructive interference between the two recombine beam when the path difference between the beam be zero or an integer multiple of λ and constructive interference occurs when the path difference be an odd integer multiple of λ 2 the two type of interference be record by the photodetector a dark low intensity and bright high intensity fringe respectively hence if we be to vary the position of either mirror m1 or m2 we could produce an interference pattern about a null point the point at which the path difference be zero and the light wave interfere destructively 1 nyquist 's theorem nyquist 's theorem state that in order to retain sufficient information from an original waveform the sample rate of a detector should be at least twice the frequency of the incident wave in term of the distance the sample distance can be at most half the wavelength of the incident wave therefore the rate at which the position of the mirror be varied should be such that we fulfil the condition of the nyquist theorem so we can obtain accurate interferograms and spectrum of the light source 2 b. fourier transform spectroscopy perform a fourier transform on an interferogram of a wave give u the spectrum of frequency or wavelength for the wave depend on the measurement take the obtain interferogram and spectrum of a wave allows u to analyse the characteristic of the wave a well a the characteristic of the wave source one significant characteristic we can observe from the interferogram and the spectrum of a light wave be the width a explain in fig 2. fig 2. the fourier transform of a narrow gaussian spectrum result in a broad interferogram and vice versa an inverse fourier transform can instead be perform on the interferogram a well follow the same forementioned principle adapt from 1 we can determine from the width of the interferogram and the spectrum of a light wave the composition of the light wave for example a light wave of a very discrete wavelength such a a laser beam would have an interferogram with a large width and a narrow spectrum while a light wave comprise light of multiple wavelength would have a narrow interferogram and a broad spectrum the interferometer be set up a show in 3. all component be secure into the metal table with placeholder a monochromatic green laser be then use for the initial alignment of the interferometer by ensure the laser beam reflect off the 2 mirror be superimpose on each other this be make easy use the 10.0 mm and 2.5 mm lens a white lead be later use a well a move the mirror at a constant speed to determine the null point of the interferometer a fringe pattern for white light could only be observe around the null point a ground glass diffuser be use to increase the dispersion of the white light once the null point be determine up to an accuracy of ±0.001mm we then measure and obtain interferograms from light source about the null point give that the photodetector have a sample rate of 50 hz and that the light source in our investigation have a range of wavelength from 400 to 800 nanometre the speed of the motor be set at a default of 0.001 mm s −1 give a sample distance of 20 nanometre which be well below half the minimum wavelength of the light source under investigation satisfy the condition of the nyquist theorem we then proceed to obtain and investigate the interferograms of the white lead tungsten source and mercury lamp source a significant source of error be the inconsistency of the motor on which the translatable mirror be instal possible imperfection in the motor cause the mirror to move at a speed which be not constant which lead to error when perform fast fourier transforms on the obtain interferograms to determine the spectrum of the investigate light wave another significant source of error be the limitation of the fft perform by the computer a it be a very basic program which simply allow u to extract the spectrum of a light source from it interferogram.further possible source of error include misalignment of equipment due to knock on the metal platform for the interferometer a well a filth on the mirror or lens these error be dealt with by cleaning the lens a well a handle the equipment with great care throughout the experiment the position of the null point be also measure again whenever there be a misalignment in the interferometer setup the obtain interferogram for the white lead be show in fig 4. we observe a narrow interferogram a expect since white light be a combination of light of different wavelength over a broad spectrum however the interferogram appear to be asymmetric which be uncharacteristic of white light a it should be approximate a a dirac delta function upon perform an fft on the interferogram we find that the spectrum of the white lead a show in fig 5 deviate significantly from the expect trend we observe from this deviation that the white lead emits light comprise the spectrum of blue and yellow light the combination of which the human eye perceives a white light the obtain result agree with the band theory of lead a hole and electron from the `` p-side `` and `` n-side `` recombine energy be release in the form of photon which have a continuous range of energy due to the energy band within the semiconductor diode this continuous range of photon energy translates into the continuous wavelength spectrum we observe from the white lead 3 the interferogram of the tungsten source be show in fig 6. the tungsten source be turn on and left until it heat up to a constant temperature before measurement be take the interferogram of the tungsten source be almost a narrow line give rise to the explanation that the tungsten source emits a continuous spectrum of light a show in it fft fig 7. we observe that the spectrum of tungsten can almost be approximate a a smooth gaussian curve this be consistent with the physical explanation that tungsten emits blackbody radiation when heat up lead to the observe continuous spectrum the measure spectrum of mercury be show in fig 8 with the spectrum for the green and yellow filter plot on the same graph we find that the spectrum of mercury have many discrete peak with significant peak around the green 530-560 nm and yellow 560-590 region in contrast to the previous investigate light source we find that the mercury vapor lamp emits light of discrete wavelength which be consistent with the physical model of mercury emit light through it electronic transition between different state a each electron in an atom can only occupy discrete energy level a a current be pas through a body of mercury vapor the atomic electron become excite and move into a high energy level before be de-excited and move back to it original energy level a they fall back to it original state the excitation energy be release in the form of photon which now have a discrete wavelength due to the discrete electronic energy level 4 although not reflect clearly in the compute fft spectrum due to the limitation of the fft program the visible green and yellow light wave emit by the mercury vapor lamp have very specific wavelength 546.075 nm green 576.961 nm yellow and 579.067 nm yellow 5 upon far investigation we be able to observe consistent beating in the interferogram of the mercury vapor lamp when the yellow filter be fix on fig 9 this prof the existence of the yellow doublet in mercury 's atomic spectrum we construct and configure a michelson interferometer to obtain the interferograms of a white lead a tungsten source and a mercury vapor lamp a fast fourier transform be then perform on these interferograms to obtain the spectrum of the light source we be then able to investigate the characteristic a well a composition of the light source the white lead and tungsten source be observe to be light source with continuous wavelength spectrum while the mercury lamp source emit light at discrete wavelength these observation be consistent with the physic behind the emission of light from the source lead 's have energy band within them while a tungsten source behaves a a black body radiation emitter and the mercury lamp emits light thorugh atomic transition the michelson interferometer prove to be precise in examine the light source obtain very accurate interferograms of each light source however there be significant limitation and source of error the main one be the inconsistent speed of the motor and the fft program which restrict a more thorough investigation of the light sources.despite these shortcoming we be still able to perform a good investigation and obtain huge insight on the light source we use with improvement to the equipment and more compute power the michelson interferometer could be use for wider and more

to examine if the optical path length of the two beam do not differ to much l the michelson interlerometer gain attention during the famous experiment on july 12 1887 conduct by albert a. michelson and edward w morley in which they tiy to prove the existence of the ether -an invisible medium thought to pem1eate the universe that allows light wave to travel in just like air act a a medium allow sound wave to propagate through in the experiment one pa1t of the device be position parallel to the motion of the eaiih while the other pa1t be pe1pendicular 2 the result hop to see in the recombine beam that one pait of the beam be slow down by the ether but there be no path difference observe although the experiment fail in prove the existence of ether it be the first attempt in use interlerometiy experimentally and lead to many more well-known interferometiy technique fourier ti•ansfo1m specti•ometer ft be one of them it be just a michelson interlerometer but with one miitor be adjustable with the scan of the move miitor over va1y distance an interferogram be produce which can be use to construct the spectnun of the light source use a fourier transform 3 2.theory the schematic diagram for the ft be show in figure 1. there be three main possible outcome at the detector at determine the interlerogram of the light source ai•ound a small range of distance case 1 when the split light travel the same distance the detector will receive constructive interference pattem it be these 3 case contribute to the construction of the fringe show in front of the detector for the actual direct observation of the interlerence pattem in front of the detector possibly a screen place in front of the detector the orientation of the two mi1rnr dete1mines what fringe be produce which be haidinger fringe and fizeau fringe by refening to figure 2 the cause of the two different type of ftinges be due to whether the two miitors be place parallel to each other or not by consider an extend source place behind the observer and look into one mi1rnr where the other miitor appear to be inside a show in figure 3. the two miitors represent two dark vertical line separate by a distance tthe difference in the travel distance of the two split light and 0 which be the angle of reflection of the incoming ray by change the orientation of one miitor from it original perpendicular state will introduce a path difference between ray of reflect light that destroys the cylindrical symmetry cause the formation of fizeau fringe that be n't circular but rather straight-linefringes 7 the equation that describes the angle 0 assume the refractive index of the medium be 1 be described by 2tcos0 mil 1 where m be the order of interference the spectrum of a light source be typically a gaussian distribution described in figure 5. so there be different frequency of light and when they interfere with each other a null point exist where all of the wavelength constructive interfere with each other show in figure 6 in which only 3 different type of wave be include this null-point exist at x =o that creates the large constructive interference throughout the graph although the actual set-up of the ft be show in figure 7 which be orientate in the same way a with figure 1. mirror a be place on a motor control through the computer make it the movable mirror of the set-up mirror b be fix to the stage and remains stationary for the entire experiment a screen be place instead of a detector to show the recombine beam of light to increase visibility in the fringe a piano-convex lens f=25.4mm lens be add at the begin of the source before the laser reach the beam splitter hence an enlarge image show on the white screen to make sure the two mittors be perfectly align pe1pendicularly tlte resultant fringe pattem should appear to be haidinger fringe by fix the move 1nittor a and adjust tlte stationary mirror b until haidinger fringe appear on the white sere en in order for more accurate measurement of the fringe afte1w ards the concentric circle of the fringe be set that the center of the circle be locate at the center of the broaden image on screen in detennining the

the result be show in figure 8. the resultant graph be very noisy and the increase signal strength towai•ds the peak be n't smooth this be due to set the speed of the stage too high 0.02 mm/s that creates aliasing to the sinusoidal wave instead of produce a sine wave result triangular wave ai•e instead produce to improve decrease the speed and increase the number of sample with the improvement a reading be take for x y z 5 0.01 15000 sta1ting from -5mm the result be show in figure 9. the intensity of the light seem to increase over the whole range a show in the graph there be an upwards

and x y z 10 0.01 50000 start from -10mm a combine image of -10mm to 0mm 0mm to 10mm be show in figure 10. there be an increase trend in the intensity signal and all the constmctive and destmctive

a null point after make sure the alignment be con-ect and the null point be found by use the monochromatic laser a a light source interferograms of a white lead blue lead tungsten light and tungsten light with yellow filter can be obtain the result be described in figure 11-14. the ultimate goal be to determine the mean wavelength of these light source by do a fourier transfo1m of the interferogram to obtain the spectnun this allows identification of the light source include the wavelength of light include in the spectmm the fourier transform of all of the light source be show in figure 15-18. it contains all the visible spectrum and be more into the infra red this be expect a tungsten light bulb have ve1y low efficiency and radiates a lot of heat through infra red radiation a

wavelength overall the ft give both good result in the interferogram and determine the spectrum of the light source it have determine the wavelength of the yellow filter tungsten light closest to the theoretical value compare to the others in which others all shift slightly more towards a high wavelength then the theoretical value this be due to the limitation of the move stage except the yellow filter tungsten light source with other light source the speed set to move be all 0.0001mm/s which be found to be too slow when processing the data go far into the graph of these interferograms it can be see that the stage seem move backwards slightly every time it want to move forward a illustrate in figure 19. the fourier transform relies on equal interval between each data point the record data be n't equal cause some failure in the fourier transform contribute to the shift of the spectrum figure 19. enlarge of the interferogram to a very small scare 20µm it can be see that the stage do n't move in equal interval and sometimes even move backwards this be n't visible in the overall graph but be reflect on the shift of the fourier transform by give the stage a slow speed 1/10 of the speed use for others for the yellow filter tungsten light source the method be efficient and successful in determine the spectrum but might introduce aliasing and noise which will affect the final result other factor include alignment issue i.e mirror be n't perfectly perpendicular to each will also affect the result to avoid this a green laser for the set up the ft will always be useful and quick to

temperature 𝑇 in the case of a thin tungsten filament be the operational temperature a it be assume that the temperature investigate tungsten a a black-body radiator opaque tube be the same throughout the filament the filament be also assume to be at thennal equilibrium wien 's displacement law state that the peak wavelength for a black body be inversely proportional to it temperature 3 where bi the wein 's displacement constant and amax be the peak wavelength of the spectium by examine the spectium use planck s law and wien 's law one can calculate the operational temperature for a tungsten filament typical temperature for tungsten filament be approximately 2800 k during usage 2 a. detail on the set-up fig 1 show the set up for the michelson interferometer that be use to conduct the experiment the arm of the interferometer be initially set such that they be approximately the same length and perpendicular this be do by use a magnetic ruler everything be align in the plane of the incident light the sensitivity of the set up mean that poor alignment can lead to a non-horizontal interferogram and large error in the spectium for high wavelength the distance of the light sow-ce and the detector from the beam splitter be not important for a bright focus sow-ce of light like a laser however with ow-tungsten sow-ce which be relatively dim we chose to reduce the beam-splitter to detector distance and put an opaque tube on the path from light sow-ce to beam splitter this be to reduce sti•ay light and increase the intensity on the detector 2.5cm and 10cm convex lens be also use to initially refract and then focus light at the detector dense black foam-cards and a large black box be also use to isolate the detector from any extemal and stray light the automate mittor can ti•avel unidirectionally along the path by command sent from a computer also the detector gain be adjust to a reasonable level such that the detector be not fully satw-ated at maximum light intensity the null point be observe when t 0 m. to detennine the prelimina1y range for the automate mittor in which the null point be locate a green laser be use and an interference pattem be observe by eye green laser because of it more limited number of wavelength have a much large coherence length compare to white light therefore an interference pattem can be observe throughout the maximum range of motion for the automate 1niitor by staiting at one of the end of the maximum range for the mi11'0r and move it towards the other end at 0.001 mm/s we note weather the fringe be travel into or out of the central maximum of the haidinger fringe haidinger fringe be circular to make determine this motion more obvious we adjust the tilt of the fix mit-ror until the centi•al maximum be visible next we move 1mm in the original direction and repeat eventually within a 1 mm range the fringe will move in the opposite direction we continued to nanow down the range until it be unclear to tell which direction the fringe be travel use this method we be able to detennine a 0.5 mm range in which the null point be position next we carefully switch the green laser to a white tungsten source the white light have a significantly small coherence length approximately 2 .23 µm 3 than the green light there be many more wavelength present meaning they can correctly superpose to produce an interference pattem for a very limited distance by move the automate miitor through the narrow range at 0.001 mm/s we can observe an interferogram within a 0.07 mm range a computer be use to collect the reading from the detector for a give position of the automate rnittor the interferograms and the spectmms for white tungsten light be shov 'il in fig 3. there be a noticeable yet abnonnal peak in the spectrum which be on average at 667.09 ± 0.01 nm the average be found by find the peak wavelength of multiple tungsten white light spectmms use eqn 3 the operational temperature of the tungsten filament be found to be 4343.3 ± 312.5 k. the uncertainty in the temperature be determine by consider the propagation of e1rnr from the average peak wavelength the datasheet for the detector sfh 2200 claim the spectral range of sensitivity to be from 300 nm to 1100 nm from our test a more accurate range be from 450 nm to 730 nm this show that the peak a see in the spectrum be false and likely due to the detector 's inability to detect em radiation in the infrared a more computational approach be take to determine the operational temperature of the tungsten filament the valid data from within the correct sensitivity range for the detector be use to cwve fit to planck 's law eqn 2 in python do so allow u to project an approximate spectrum for tungsten and obtain the operational temperatw•e a a parameter the fit and project spectrwn can be see in fig 4. the calculate operational temperature of tungsten be 3550 ± 1100 x 10 5 k. even though the value of the temperature be closer to the expect value the uncertainty be large enough to invalidate this result this tr•eatrnent on other tungsten white light spectrum result in similar result consider fig 4b the uncertainty be quite large due to the natw•e of the cwve fitting and projection the data use for the cwve fit be only a very small section of the potential spectmm which make the behavior of the rest of the spectrwn unclear additionally ow• initial assumption be incorrect could also lead to such a large uncertainty we assume that the tungsten filament emits light a a black body at thermal equilibrium potentially enough time be not give for the tungsten source to reach equilibrium temperatw•e or tungsten may not behave a a black body if the latter be true then the treatment of cwve fitting to planck 's law be invalid however this be unlikely due to the overwhelm amount of research show tungsten filament be a black body radiator other source of en-or we face be minor the stability of the automate mitrnr can be determine by look at the separation in distance between consecutive measurement the standard e1rnr of these separation be ± 1.4044 x 10-s 1lllll at 1 µm/s speed this be relatively ve1y small and such show the motion of the automate miitor to be stable the noise level of the detector be determine to be negligible the reading from the detector when the light source be off be compare to when the light sow•ce be on at a give gain the comparison show the noise level to be insignificant especially when reading be do near the null point give the negligible errnrs in the measw•ements of the detector and motion of the automate mirror the interferogram for light with wavelength in the correct sensitivity range be accw•ate therefore in the correct sensitivity range the spectmm data be valid unfortunately due to the large errnr in the value for the operational temperatw•e the experiment must be deem inconclusive the large errnr be primarily due to the detector s inability to measure significantly outside the visible range for em radiation far experiment need to be conduct with a photodetector with a sensitivity range extend much far into the infrared this will allow for a much more accurate curve fit and low uncertainty in the parameter of the fit ideally a sensitive infrared the1mometer will also be use to verify the temperature of the filament t the path difference for the reflect light ray to produce constmctive interference be where additionally substitute eqn 5 and 6 into eqn 4 and simplify produce eqn 1,prediction,the
124,2ndINT_XUL605_Redacted,a mirror in the michelson interferometer be move over a range and the signal picked up by the photodiode detector be use to plot interferograms of different light source a fast fourier transform be then take to identify wavelength correspond to the peak in the amplitude record by the detector this be perform for a white light source and a tungsten lamp with no filter and also for the tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter experimental value for the mean wavelength be found to be in close agreement with theoretical result provide by the manufacturer of the source and filter interference occurs when two or more wave meet and the resultant wave be the vector sum of the displacement of the individual wave depend on the phase difference between the wave either constructive or destructive interference occurs this fundamental concept underpins optical physic and be the basis for the michelson interferometer the michelson interferometer be design towards the end of the 19 th century a part of the michelson-morley experiment which be set up to test the relative motion of matter through ether contrary to what the then-prevalent ether theory predict albert michelson and edward morley discover no difference in the speed of light in different direction albert einstein credit this experiment for lay the groundwork for research into alternate theory which soon lead to his theory of special relativity today the michelson interferometer can be refine use computer to facilitate very precise measurement of length and be use in the famous recent direct observation of gravitational wave in 2015. in this experiment one of the mirror in the michelson interferometer be move through a range produce a pattern of constructive and destructive interference pattern picked up by the photodiode detector and use to plot an interferogram this interferogram can then be use to obtain the wavelength of the source by take a fast fourier transform fft light be emit from a source and arrives at the beam splitter which separate the light into two different beam a and b travel at right angle to each other these beam both reflect off mirror m1 and m2 respectively and recombine to form beam c at the beam splitter before travel to the detector by the principle the condition for constructive or destructive interference between two monochromatic plane wave of path difference ∆𝑑 be where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the wave and 𝑛 ∈ ℕ. when n be even there will be constructive interference and when n be odd there will be destructive interference in this experiment the path difference between the two wave can be see to be t in figure 1. the null point be the point at which the two beam of light have no path difference and corresponds to t 0 meaning that both beam travel exactly the same distance between be split by and then return to the beam splitter normally at this point there be constructive interference between the two wave the beam splitter use have a partially silver surface on one side and a dielectric plate on the other side the dielectric plate on the beam splitter cause a phase change of 180 degree in the beam that be reflect this mean that the two beam will interfere differently for a give distance from the null point at t 0 the beam will now destructively interfere a they be in antiphase and in equation 2 when n be even there will be destructive interference and when n be odd constructive interference occurs to produce an interferogram the path difference t be varied and result be collect the result interferograms can be approximate use a gaussian function of the form here a be an arbitrary constant great than zero the fourier transform of this function be then where 𝜔 represent angular frequency this can be solve through integration by part to produce a gaussian in 𝜔-space the spectral width of a spectral line refers to the width of that line and we can see from equation 3 and 5 that there be an inverse relationship between the width of the interferogram and the gaussian spectral line finally the coherence length a quantity sometimes use to describe the spectral quality of a light source be define to be the fwhm of the interferogram for the source the relationship between spectral width and coherence length be where δ𝑣 be the spectral width l be the coherence length and c be the speed of light the apparatus be set up in accordance with the schematic in figure 1 with a piece of string be use to ensure the length of the two arm of the interferometer be equal it be also necessary to ensure that the interferometer be precisely align to avoid error in the wavelength value to do this a green laser be use a the source and the detector be remove this meant that the laser beam would continue on and so a card be place approximately 1m away on the path of the 2 beam if there appear to be two dot on the card then the interferometer be not align correct and the position of the source need to be adjust until the two dot completely overlap and interference fringe could be see by eye next in order to obtain interferograms that can be use to determine the wavelength of the source the null point must first be locate a green laser be use and the moveable mirror be programmed to move across different distance interval and it be observe by eye if the fringe where either expand or contract a neither of the mirror be tilt circular haidinger fringe be observe this experiment the interval locate in which the fringe change from expand to contract be first found to be at distance +5.5mm to +6.1mm from the mirror 's default position now the green laser be replace with a white light source and the mirror set to move over this interval at a speed of 0.002mm/s a the detector sample the signal at a rate of 50hz 15000 sample be require so that data collection and the moveable mirror stop at the same time in the interferogram produce it be expect that there will be a large spike in the signal around the null point figure 2 illustrates this from figure 2 it be clear that the null point be at 5.67mm there appear to be a slight asymmetry in the interferogram and it be believe that the cause of this be due to the light beam still be structure this can be correct by use a ground glass diffuser have found the null point data can now be collect to determine the wavelength of different light source for all the reading the mirror be move over an interval of 0.6mm with the null point at the centre at a speed of 0.002mm/s and 15000 sample be take -- -- -- first a white light source be investigate figure 3 be the fft of the interferogram in figure 2. this result agrees with the theoretical prediction of two peak at 460nm and 600nm however there also appear to be a sinusoidal dependence in figure 2 which ca n't be explain by the theo1y possible explanation for this be that the fluctuation have arisen from a misalignment in the apparatus or possibly due to small vibration cause by movement while data be be collect the next reading be perfo1med on a different day and so the null point have to be locate again in case the apparatus have be move or random vibration have alter the point slightly use a tungsten light source with no filter the null point be found to be 6.014mm figure 4 a fft be perfo1med on this interferogram and an value for the mean wavelength of 900nm be obtain this be close to the theoretical value of 850nm provide by the manufacturer of the source the tungsten light source be then investigate with filter figure 5 and 6 depict the interferograms and result of fft these for green and yellow filter respectively a the filter only allow a nan ow range of wavelength through theoretically we expect to observe a wideenvelope gaussian a can be see in these figure additionally the theoretical prediction for wavelength of 543nm and 580nm for the green and yellow filter respectively agree with the experimental result the aim of this experiment be to build a michelson interferometer and use it to perform fourier transform spectroscopy to identify the wavelength of different light source while the experiment be successful in accurately obtain value for the wavelength in line with theoretical prediction a more rigorous treatment of the associate error could have be include the experiment could have be far extend by apply gaussian fit to the graph from which the standard deviation could be calculate which would provide an uncertainty on the wavelength in addition to this the speed use for the mirror 's movement be determine through trial and error however a more accurate method could have be to use nyquist 's theorem to determine the optimum rate of take sample to prevent either under or over sample another area of the experiment that could be improve be the effect of background light on the reading while it would not have be possible to take reading in complete darkness due to other experiment be conduct nearby this experiment could have be optimise by ensure that the background light be constant during reading and other lamp nearby be n't be switch on or off 6 reference,extended,bal
125,2ndINT_HDP206_Redacted,michelson interferometer be use a a spectrometer to obtain spectrum for a white lead tungsten light source and mercury lamp the spectrum for a white lead have one narrow short wavelength peak at 500 ± 16 nm a broad yellow light distribution peak at 629 ± 65 nm the shape of the spectrum resemble the nature of the white lead but the peak be shift towards high wavelength for the tungsten light source the spectrometer capture a range of the expect spectrum but the result be limited by the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode the mercury lamp spectrum capture the region of high intensity but a the frequency fluctuates substantially it fail to capture the expect narrow well define spectral line finally a separation of 2.099 ± 0.014 nm for the yellow doublet of mercury be found from the interferogram of the mercury lamp with a yellow filter the experiment be subject to systematical error where the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode and the fluctuation of the stage movement of the movable mirror affected the result i n the michelson interferometer an incident beam of light be split into two part that be recombine after travel different optical path the optical path difference produce an interference pattern that can be use to perform precision measurement the first interferometer be invent in 1881 by albert michelson and be use in the famous michelson-morley experiment unsuccessfully prove the existence of the `` aether `` 1 despite it age and simple design it be one of the most accurate apparatus design by mankind this be demonstrate through it use in the gravitational wave observatory ligo capable of measure length variation on the order of 10 −21 2 in this experiment the michelson interferometer be adapt to a spectrometer capable of determine the characteristic spectrum of different light source specifically the experiment aim to investigate the physical process govern the white light produce by a lead a tungsten light source and a mercury lamp the layout of the michelson interferometer use in the experiment be show in figure 1. an incident light beam from the source fall on a partially-silvered surface where roughly half of the incident light amplitude be transmit to mirror m2 while the reflect light beam fall on the movable mirror m1 upon return to the beam splitrer the beam undergo partial reflection and recombination where the resultant beam be direct towards a photodiode that measure the interference pattern monochromatic plane wave with wavelength λ be emit from the source upon recombination at the beam splitter the beam interfere the interference be determine by the path difference of the beam the dielectric plate on the transmit beam induces a phase change of λ/2 for the transmit beam such that the interference pattern have dark fringe at optical path difference of integer value of λ. when m1 be move a distance t λ/2 the total path difference change by λ and each fringe move one position relative to the adjacent fringe consequently by counting the number of fringe m a the mirror be move displacement accurate to a fraction of a wavelength can be measure for plane wave the order of interference be govern by the equation 2t mλ 1 in order to use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer one of the mirror must be move to vary the path difference when the path difference be change steadily the intensity of the fringe interferogram at the detector change sinusoidally the period depends on the rate at which the path-difference be change and the wavelength λ of the light source the interferogram be related to the correspond spectrum by the fourier transform the relationship between the fourier transform interferogram and the correspond spectrum also extends to polychromatic light this be due to the non-dispersive property of air such that each frequency from the source be transmit separately a a consequence the spectrum of the light source be the sum of all the fourier transform interferograms for more complicate light source with several wavelength present the interferogram be take at the null point this be the point of zero path difference i.e d1 d2 and have the unique feature of all the different fringe pattern of each frequency component be in phase thus all the frequency component will be at their point of maximum interference and no information be lose another useful feature of the interferogram be it ability to determine the separation of two wavelength through the beating phenomenon consider light of two wavelength λ 1 λ 2 the intensity of the interferogram will be at a maximum when the pattern from one be exactly in phase with the pattern from the other by substitute with equation 1 and assume the separation be small the separation can be found from the change in path length t where λ be the average wavelength between the two wavelength from symmetry the point of minimum intensity have an equal separation with the michelson interferometer set up accord to the diagram in figure 1 interferograms for blue and white lead a tungsten light source and a mercury lamp be gather for the mercury lamp green and yellow filter be use to isolate the green spectral line and the yellow doublet the data for the position of the movable mirror and amplitude of the photodiode be collect at a sample rate of 50 hz with the stage speed set to 0.002mm/s to avoid aliasing data be collect in the range of ± 0.2 mm about the null point yield 10000 data point since the interferogram take consists of discrete data point the application of discrete fourier transform be require more specifically the experiment use fast fourier transform fft a this be more computational efficient for large datasets a the light source have polychromatic spectrum the data be collect around the null point to locate the null point a green laser be use to determine the range in which the direction of fringe emerge change consequently the interferogram of a white lead be use to locate the point of maximum amplitude and hence the null point to a accuracy of ±0.01 mm all the measure amplitude have be re-scaled such that their maximum be at 100 to allow comparison of the spectrum a light emit diode lead be a semiconductor light source emit light due to electron recombination with electron hole in the semiconducting material this release energy in the form of photon by vary the electron band gap in the semiconductor the energy of the photon and thus the wavelength can be control the white lead use in this experiment produce white light through the combination of a blue wavelength lead with a phosphor coat the phosphor coat produce a broad yellow light that combine with the blue to create a spectrum we perceive a white light fig 2 spectrum create from a fft of the interferogram of the white and blue lead a gaussion be fit to estimate the mean wavelength and the standard deviation in figure 2 the measure spectrum of a white lead be show in grey by fitting two gaussian distribution the first peak have a mean wavelength of 500 ± 16 nm while the second peak 629 ± 65 nm in comparison with the typical spectrum of a white lead a show in figure 8 in the appendix the wavelength seem to be red-shifted this be also the case for the blue lead show in blue in figure 2 with a mean wavelength of 512 ± 14 nm compare to an expect wavelength 470 ± 5 nm it be therefore likely that there be a systematic error shift the wavelength value despite this the shape of the distribution still agrees with the physical process of a white lead a there be a narrow peak at short wavelength and a broader distribution of yellow light however the amplitude of the short wavelength be expect to be significantly high than the amplitude of the yellow light a the short wavelength be the source of the yellow light emit from the phosphor this be likely due to the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode use in the experiment from figure 7 in the appendix the photodiode be approximately twice a sensitive for yellow light a for blue light this explains the discrepancy of the amplitude a a tungsten white light source be an incandescent source it can be approximate a a black body thus the temperature of the black body can be calculate from wien 's displacement law in figure 3 the measure spectrum of the tungsten light source be plot in blue peak at 868 ± 4 nm and thus have a black body temperature of 3334 ± 15 k where the error be estimate from the resolution around the peak wavelength the spectrum do not appear to follow the maxwell-boltzmann distribution expect from a black body light source in figure 9 in the appendix the manufacturer 's measure spectral distribution be show unlike this experiment measure spectrum the spectrum behaves like a black body with a temperature of 2796 k. the orange line represent the product of the measure spectrum and the photodiode 's spectral sensitivity the data for the sensitivity be adopt from 6 where the value be extrapolate to an exponential decay below 400 nm and above 1100 nm again this discrepancy be likely to be cause by the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode a it be incapable of measure wavelength above 1100 nm whereas the tungsten light source emits light up to 2800 nm a the photodiode effectively behaves like a wavelength filter the measure signal be a convolution of the tungsten spectrum and the sensitivity of the photodiode a the spectrum be a fft convolution be equal to multiplication in frequency domain 4 in figure 3 the product of the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode and the manufacturer 's tungsten spectrum be show in orange this agrees with the measure spectrum and thus provide strong evidence to support the origin of the discrepancy mercury lamp produce light through the action of high pressure mercury vapour that ionises and be excite to high energy state a a current be pas through the vapour a the mercury undergoes atomic transition photon with an energy equal to the difference of the state be emit a a consequence the light spectrum consists of narrow spectral line of well define wavelength the most prominent spectral line be at wavelength 404.6 nm 435.8 nm 546.0 nm green and the yellow doublet 576.9 nm and 579.0 nm 9 the measure spectrum in figure 4 capture the region of high intensity a show in the reference mercury spectrum in figure 10 in the appendix with the high peak again red-shifted at 559 ± 4 nm and 593 ± 10 nm however the spectrum be not able to capture the distinct narrow spectral line expect for a mercury lamp the inaccuracy and noisy data in the ffts be likely to be cause by the variation of the stage movement a illustrate in figure 11 in the appendix the stage speed between data point can fluctuate up to 75 but still average to the set value of 0.002 mm/s to far study the green spectral line at 546.0 nm and the yellow doublet the measurement be record with bandpass filter a show in figure 5 where the filter transmission profile also be plot the fact that the spectrum have wavelength far outside the transmission bandwidth of both the filter individually far demonstrates the inaccuracy of the ffts the peak amplitude of the spectrum be shift about 13 nm compare to the accepted value of mercury spectral line which far illustrates the systematical error in the experiment to determine the separation of the yellow doublet an interferogram be obtain a show in figure 6. a expect the beating phenomenon be observe where the node have nonzero amplitude indicate background light or a difference in amplitude of the two wavelength by take the average node separation over four period the change in position t between node be found to be 0.0795 mm combine with the mean wavelength of the accepted value of the yellow doublet of λ 578.012 nm equation 2 yield a separation of 2.099±0.014 nm which be only a 0.33 deviation from the accepted value of 2.106 nm here the error have be estimate from the uncertainty of the position of the node down to one fringe the accuracy of this measurement demonstrates the interferometer accuracy when work with the interferogram through measurement of various light source there appear to be a systematical error in the spectrum obtain from take a fft of the interferogram a the mean wavelength value be shift from the reference level a the interferogram be able to determine the separation of the yellow mercury doublet to an uncertainty of 0.67 there be strong reason to believe that the error arises when take the fft a possible explanation could be the variation of the stage 's movement which be found to fluctuate significantly and thus can affect the result of the fft in addition the photodiode can detect background light from the surroundings and light from the source that have not travel through the interferometer the alignment of the setup be critical to observe an interference pattern but can not explain the shift in wavelength the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode also affected the result a it measure nonphysical amplitude difference and fail to cover the whole spectrum furthermore there be error introduce by the component such a the flatness of the mirror and imperfect lens a well a environmental error such a index change cause by variation in temperature pressure and humidity in this experiment a michelson interferometer be use a a spectrometer record the interference pattern over a range of position and take a fft of the interferogram to obtain the spectrum the spectrometer be use to obtain spectrum for different white light source a white solid state lead an incandescent tungsten light source and a mercury lamp that emits light through atomic transition the spectrum for a white lead have two peak a expect one narrow short wavelength peak at 500 ± 16 nm from the lead and a broad yellow light distribution peak at 629±65 nm from the phosphor coat however the peak be redshifted relative to the manufacturer 's datasheet a there be a systematic error in the experiment for the tungsten light source the spectrometer capture a range of the expect spectrum limited by the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode a a result the measure spectrum resemble a gaussian like distribution while expect to be maxwell-boltzmann distribution for a black body light source the mercury lamp spectrum capture the region of high intensity with peak in proximity to the expect wavelength however the frequency fluctuates substantially and fails to capture the narrow well define spectral line from the atomic transition in the mercury lamp furthermore the spectrum of the light that pas through green and yellow bandpass filter reside outside the transmission bandpass of the filter again show that there be a systematic error in the spectrometer finally the separation of the yellow doublet of mercury be found from the interferogram of the mercury lamp with a yellow filter the separation be found to be 2.099±0.014 nm which have a percentage error of only 0.33 compare to the accepted value this demonstrates the setup accuracy a an interferometer and suggests that the systematic error stem from the spectrum obtain from the fft in conclusion this experiment show the feasibility of use the michelson interferometer a an spectrometer a feature of various light source can be distinguish from the spectrum the experiment could be far improve through the addition of a photodiode capable of measure the whole spectrum of the light source in addition a more accurate movable mirror would increase the accuracy of the spectrum obtain from the ffts fig 7 the relative spectral sensitivity of the photodiode a quote in the manufaturer 's datasheet the high variance of

be a technique that utilizes the characteristic interference pattern generate by light source pas through an interferometer in order to obtain an emission spectrum for the source in this spectroscopy a michelson interferometer be use to interfere light from a source with itself over a vary path difference create an interferogram the interferograms be then analyse to produce an emission spectrum of the source by fourier transform the spatial interferogram into wavelength space this technique differs from dispersion spectroscopy where the fourier transform be effectively perform physically by the diffraction element ft be valuable in physic astronomy and chemistry a an accurate spectroscopy technique with a high resolve power 1 the michelson interferometer make famous from the 1887 michelson-morley experiment which first provide evidence for the nonexistence of the so-called luminiferous ether 2 u a coherent source and a path difference to create an interference pattern a illustrate in 1 an incident beam can be pas through a beam splitter into two beam travel separate path these beam be then reflect and recombine in the splitter to create a new beam by vary the length of one of the path or 'arms with a mobile mirror label 5 in figure 1 you can create a path difference and hence phase difference between the two beam this phase difference cause an interference pattern which can be observe on a screen or by a detector a motorise stage be use to control the velocity of the mirror the range over which it move and the number of data sample take the fringe show in 2 be the result of a monochromatic laser beam in a well-aligned michelson interferometer the concentric circular fringe occur a the path difference of the light varies radially within the cross-section of the light beam perpendicular to the direction of travel the interferograms produce by the michelson interferometer depend on the frequency of light present in the source use a computer to perform a fourier transform on the interferograms produce a spectrum in frequency space a fast fourier transform fft be use from the python scipy.fftpack package to perform quick discrete fourier transforms on our bulk set of data the discrete fourier transform dft be give by where x n x 0 x 1 ... x n −1 be a signal in configuration space compose of n number and x x k 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 be the transform signal in wavelength space 3 in the context of our data x n be the detect interferogram and corresponds to a sequence of value of intensity over a range of position x k be therefore the power spectrum in frequency space which can be convert to wavelength space a a continuous fourier transform change the domain of a function over a continuous interval a dft performs the same function for discrete datasets with small evenly-spaced separation this make it easy to be perform by a computer and the fft employ an algorithm which reduces the processing time of a dft such that execution time scale a ∼ n log n a oppose to n 2 for a regular dft calculation give that the mirror move at a fix speed and sample rate for all data set the assumption that the separation between data point take be small compare to the total range of movement and even be take to be true in iv the fourier transforms perform be on wavepackets that follow a gaussian form or similar by take the transform into wavelength space of a gaussian you create another gaussian with related property where λ be wavelength the transform domain σ be the width of the configuration space gaussian and ρ be the width of the wavelength space gaussian and it can be show that ρ 1 σ this implies that a wide interferogram wavepacket will produce a narrow spectral distribution and vice versa this effect will be observable on the spectrum present in later section the first objective of the investigation be to locate the null point of the apparatus the null point be the point of zero path difference between the beam and occurs when the length of the arm of the interferometer be identical because of this it be around the null point where the interence pattern intensity be great and so it be essential to know this point in order to produce interferograms quickly and easily a per the instruction in 4 the interferometer be construct such that the distance between the splitter and each mirror be measurably similar within a few millimeter a green laser with an expand lens be then use a the light source such that clear haidinger fringe be produce such a those in 2. the stage be translate to an arbitrary start location and then move through a small displacement in the positive direction such that the fringe could be observe to be travel radially outwards or inwards a property of the null point be that the direction of movement of the fringe switch around it furthermore the closer the stage be to the nullpoint the wider the observe fringe be so few be visible in a fix area hence by move the stage to different location and note the direction of motion of the fringe a well a the fringe size a quick binary-style search can be perform to find the range that contains the null point an example of this search be give in table i -the table show a convergence on the null point to a 0.1 mm interval between −5.9 mm and −6.0 mm at this interval the expand laser be no longer appropriate for find the source a the fringe become too big to tell what direction they be move in a white lead be use instead a our simulation show that it interferogram would be null everywhere expect at distance very close to the null point see a the width of the distribution of wavelength in the light from the white lead be very large 5 and cover the visible spectrum which a mention in ii-b corresponds to a narrow interferogram hence the null point could be localise quickly use this source the interval determine in i be scan through through iterative narrow down of the interval contain the null point eventually a detailed interferogram could be take the number of sample to be take and the distance move by the mirror be configure so that the distance between sample be 20 nm which be the small resolvable distance the stage be capable of move in prior experimentation with the apparatus it be found that if the distance between sample be less than this then the data become erratic furthermore if the small distance move be less than the small resolvable distance of the stage then one can not consider the individual measurement of distance reliable use the interferogram obtain it be possible to analytically determine the null point the interferogram have a non-zero background signal which be determine use numpy.mean and subtract from the signal data this be to make the code to fit the data easy the background adjust interferogram for the white lead be show in 3. the interferogram be symmetrical in the distance axis so only one half of the data need to be fit in order to find the position of the peak therefore the absolute value of signal be plot against position and be found to fit a gaussian distribution sufficiently well use the scipy.optimize.curve_fit function the parameter for the mean and standard deviation be optimise and the result fit be show in 4. the parameter return determine the null point to be at −5.89644 ± 0.00001 mm the same process be repeat for three more datasets include two of the blue lead to include the effect of the distribution type on the fit parameter the mean value of the null point with standard deviation be then determine a −5.8963 ± 0.0001 mm this value be not consistent with the result of the binary search from table i. this be because a fine alignment alteration be make between the green laser and the white lead that change the null point very slightly such that it be easy to find without repeat the binary search by extend the scan interval this null point value be use to centre all the interferograms produce from other light source the thorlabs sls201l be use a a light source for this investigation without a filter apply the lamp act a a white light source a it be approximately a black body radiator 6 and compare to the white lead be less intense and visibly more orange in light our spectrum in 5 support this observation a it show a large bandwidth fwhm 310±2 nm that cover most of the visible light spectrum imply white light but have very low intensity at the blue wavelength of light ∼ 450nm the graph also show high intensity outside of visible light and the central wavelength λ 871.9 ± 0.8 nm be in infrared from 5 the gaussian be not a perfect fit due to the shape of the distribution and this make our cite λ an estimate the uncertainty give be produce by the fit package but be an underestimate a black body emission would be a well fit and be provide in the documentation for the lamp 6 the tungsten lamp be use in conjunction with the fl543.5-10 green filter in the setup from ii-a the interferogram obtain however have the feature of an uneven background level this shift in background intensity could have be due to a slight misalignment in the apparatus such a the adjustable fix mirror be slightly realign this would change the centre of the interference pattern on the detector and could cause a gradient in intensity a the path difference change in order to counter this a linear fit be make in python to characterise the vary background slope and this be then subtract from the data to rectify it result in the improve interferogram in 7. it be worth note that the background do not affect the fourier transform of the data a the spectrum only depends on the frequency of the light and not their absolute position the result interferogram be then fourier transform use the package delineate in ii-b to produce an emission spectrum figure 8 which be analyse figure 8 show that the gaussian do not perfectly fit the data but give a good approximation of the mean and width of the spectral distribution the mean wavelength obtain from the fit parameter be 539.5 ± 0.6 nm with an fwhm of 82 ± 1 nm the fwhm full width half maximum be a width measurement calculate from the standard deviation parameter sigma optimise during the gaussian fit use the formula f w hm 2 2 log 2σ from the thorlabs specification for the filter 7 the central wavelength λ 543.5±2 nm with an fwhm of 10±2 nm be quote which do not include the obtain value of either central wavelength or width in it tolerance the estimate wavelength carry an error of 0.74 which be small but not negligible give the precision of the apparatus use and the magnitude of the distance the experiment operate over it be likely that the error on the central wavelength give by the fit parameter of the gaussian be an underestimate a there be a large spread around the peak of the curve if a well fit function be found that yield a more representative uncertainty then the experimental value for λ could include the manufacturer 's wavelength the fwhm found from the fit have 720 error compare to the value quote in 7 which be a significant spectral broadening this spectral broadening could be due to the unreliability in the movement of the stage at small distance which would cause it to move by large amount than the calculate distance between sample thus cause a spread in the signal pattern when look directly at the signal and distance data generate from the detector the distance interval between measurement be not regular and can vary by up to an order of magnitude some consecutive measurement have position difference of only a few nanometre whereas some have difference great than the 20 nm calculate separation this give credit to the idea that the stage 's movement at small distance be not reliable even though the data look smoother when compare to data take from run where the number of sample lead to a calculate measurement separation of less than 20 nm this creates problem a an even separation between data point be one of the assumption that validate the use of a dft and hence the fft use to calculate the spectrum since this condition have be violate it be reasonable to suggest that the broadening of the spectral peak could be due to effect create by the fft -by use a calculate data point separation in the fft when the actual separation of value be irregular the spectrum could easily have be broaden by cast value for signal to incorrect wavelength value the interferogram produce by the tungstgen lamp with a yellow filter do not require an alteration for linear background intensity which support the idea that the change in intensity type be due to a misalignment before take the data for the green filter a the green filter be the last experiment to be execute the spectrum from the yellow filter interferogram be show in 9. the value λ 575.9 ± 0.8 nm and fwhm 88 ± 2 nm be obtain from the fit in 9. the central wavelength have an error of 0.71 on the manufacturer 's value also found in 7 and the fwhm have a 780 error these discrepancy be consistent with those in iv-a which corroborate the explanation make a it give evidence that the data set for the green filter be not unique compare figure 8 and 9 the distribution be similar -9 also show a large spread of data nearer the peak which would imply a large uncertainty on the peak wavelength than give by the fit parameter at the base of the distribution it be also visible that the gaussian overshoot the data which implies the fwhm might be overestimate by the fit parameter albeit not by an amount that would reduce it to the value give by the manufacturer look closely at the data point the spread at the top of the distribution look like a double peak this be not mention anywhere in the manufacturer 's documentation and there be no physical reason that could be determine for their to be two peak wavelength let through by the filter and so only one peak be fit it be possible that the appearance of this double peak be due to the stage movement and fft issue discus in iv-a this experiment have demonstrate the power of fourier transform spectroscopy to utilise simple interferometry principle and computational method to analyse light source in detail with good result for the wavelength of spectrum yield error of 0.74 and 0.71 on wavelength of the green and yellow light source respectively however there be a clear spectral broadening effect apparent in the result see in the experiment with the monochromatic distribution appear ∼ 7.5 time a wide a expect this have be attribute to the motorise stage use in the experiment after inspection of the raw data and consideration of the analysis technique use this do not discredit the technique a a whole which could produce precise and accurate result with the correct equipment an interest comparison would be to test a different stage and see if the broadening be reduce but this be beyond the scope of the experiment the interferogram of a white light source be simulated and produce 10. at large scale this distribution look simply like a vertical spike in a zero-signal which make it easy to locate when scan though large range hence why the white lead be use the null point itself be locate at the origin on the diagram which corresponds to the point at the peak of the signal envelope by model the signal a a gaussian packet the mean position can be found and the null point determine,deep,exp
127,2ndINT_BQD756_Redacted,separation of the frequency in fourier space 4 with the fft a gaussian spectral feature will lead to a gaussian temporal feature i.e a decay envelope to analyse the

be use in combination with a 25.4mm lens la1951-a to broaden the source before the beam splitter and a 100m lens la1509-a after the beam splitter to focus the beam the fringe pattern be observe at a long distance approx 2m to reduce uncertainty the beam splitter be centre and then the kinematic mirror be use to move the fringe until maximum interference be observe the aim be to have a central haidinger fringe in the centre of the pattern if fizeau fringe be present the angle of the kinematic mirror be skewed once align much caution must be use when modify the interferometer so a to not misalign it once more it be important to know the position of the null point of the set-up a it be over this point that the maximum interference pattern be observe with the detector in a position with clear contrast fringe the green laser be use to find a range where the null lie by scan at interval and see if the fringe be disappear into or appear out of the centre the point at which they cross over be the null point once an interval of approximately 0.2mm be found the white light source be place in with a ground glass diffuser dg10-1500-md to remove the conical structure of the lead from the beam and a interferogram be take with a speed 1µms -1 to find the exact location of the null the original location of the null be 6.0785mm this be take a an indicator for each other source the source chosen to analyse where a white lead ospw5111p a blue lead osub5111p and a stabilize tungsten-halogen light source with either no filter a green filter fl543.5-10 or a yellow filter fb580-10 it be worth note that when the lead be in use they must be held in a v-block clamp vc1m and place at 1cm away from the centre of the diffuser when the tungsten light source be be use it must be screw in to the collimator package ac050-008-a-ml the filter can be place directly into the filter holder of the light source use a spanner wrench all source be scan with the 100mm lens in the lens tube for each source a slightly longer interferogram 0.5mm be take at 10µms -1 to find the exact location of the null and then a slow interferogram be take at 1µms -1 over the null the detector take measurement at 50hz so a slow speed would result in large clarity in the data this obtains the signal amplitude the time and the position of the stage for each measurement and use python a fft be perform on each signal to garner a wavelength spectrum to investigate the mechanic of the source a gaussian fit be apply to each spectrum and use the fwhm the coherence length be determine from equation 3 and the peak wavelength be evaluate diffuser could be screw on between the light source and the lens tube when require on the right hand side be the photodetector to combat the effect of light pollution the interferometer be place in a black out box and black foam stand be use between the arm the apparatus be secure with clamp fork and the apparatus be regularly clean with isopropanol to ensure the lens and mirror be clear a see in figure 3 the wavelength spectrum have a clear gaussian distribution form the peak wavelength visible from the blue lead be 442 ± 12 nm with the uncertainty be determine from take the average residual in value within 0.5 standard deviation of the fit gaussian from the peak this result in a fwhm of 33 ± 6 and a coherence length of 2.20 ± 0.09 µm for the blue lead the uncertainty in fwhm have be estimate by calculate the average error of the peak and two half-maximums between the data and the fit gaussian the uncertainty in the fwhm and peak wavelength have propagate to the coherence length thus these uncertainty have be add in fractional quadrature to give the final uncertainty these error have mainly arose from the random error in the acceleration of the stage and the uncertainty in it own position 6 furthermore it be physically impossible to have the lead perfectly centre in the lens tube so this creates less precise interference pattern within blue lead the light emit layer be construct of indium gallium nitride ingan 7 the peak wavelength of the blue lead agrees with the expect range for an ingan lead a it be in the low range of blue wavelength and some low energy ultra-violet contribution be expect moreover in comparison to the white source it could be expect that the blue lead have a longer coherence length a the source be more monochromatic from figure 4 the small gaussian have a peak wavelength 453 ± 14 nm and a coherence length of 2.7 ± 0.1 µm and the large gaussian have a peak wavelength of 626 ± 58 nm and a coherence length of 1.000 ± 0.002 µm the low wavelength distribution be comparable to that of the blue lead and the large distribution show contribution from green through to red it be not possible to construct a true white lead a they must consists of a wide wavelength spectrum low coherence length due to this they be make of an ingan lead with a phosphor coat 8 which carry out a stoke 's shift on small wavelength to produce a wide spectrum of visible light figure 4 reinforces this a the spectrum can be see a the combination of a blue lead spectrum and a visible spectrum with a large spectral width the tungsten source can be consider to be a 'near blackbody radiator 10 a see in figure 5 the tungsten light source behave a a white light source with a large spectral width the peak wavelength be measure at 840 ± 125 nm and the coherence length be measure at 0.913 ± 0.0005 µm use equation 6 the temperature of the source be calculate to be 3400 ± 500k which lie just outside of the range of uncertainty of the manufacturer value 11 from this black-body behaviour a maxwell-boltzmann distribution would be expect due to the continuous kinetic energy of tungsten molecule this distribution be not observe a the photodetector use in the interferometer be not very sensitive to wavelength outside of the visible spectrum however the rayleigh-jeans fit in figure 5 show that this behaviour be observe for wavelength in which the detector be sensitive thus far reinforce the black-body nature of the tungsten source furthermore the manufacturer state the wavelength range a 360nm -2600nm 11 which support the fact that the detector be not sensitive a the measure spectrum have a much narrower spectral width from figure 6 the tungsten with a yellow filter have a peak wavelength 582 ± 5 nm with a coherence length 15 ± 13 µm whereas in figure 7 the peak wavelength be 543 ± 5 nm and the coherence length be 7 ± 3 µm this be in agreement with the manufacturer value for the filter 12 the large uncertainty be due to the low signal strength in this range of wavelength from the tungsten source show that the tungsten source be largely compose of low frequency visible component or infrared component despite contain these spectrum the high uncertainty decrease the usefulness of a tungsten source when use a a light source for shorter visible wavelength to conclude a michelson interferometer be built to investigate the define characteristic of light source interferograms be take over the null point of the device for a white lead blue lead and a stabilize tungsten-halogen light source with vary filter a fast fourier transform be take to calculate the wavelength spectrum for each source and the peak wavelength full width half maximum and coherence length be determine from the spectrum it be possible to identify that a white lead be construct of an ingan blue lead with a phosphor coat which result in a broad spectrum over the visible wavelength furthermore the tungsten source be see to be a black-body radiator which behaves a a white light source with a large spectral width than a white lead despite identify the tungsten source a a blackbody radiator a more sensitive photodetector would be require to confirm that it wavelength distribution do result in a maxwell boltzmann distribution this would also give a well estimation for the temperature of the source to improve the experiment the mechanism for the light emission in each source could be investigate for example the mechanic behind the stoke 's shift in phosphor for the white lead alternatively a wider range of light source could be utilised e.g an ultra-violet source,deep,exp
128,2ndINT_TFY667_Redacted,the aim of the experiment be to investigate the property of different light source and filter use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer the null point be found to be -0.86 ± 0.01 mm the mean wavelength of white light from an lead be measure to be 580 ± 5 nm compare to 814 ± 158 nm from a tungsten white light lamp illustrate tungsten a a black body place a green filter on the tungsten source widen the coherence length from 0.818 ± 0.318 µm to 1.80 ± 0.11 µm fourier transforms of interferograms be take and the spectral width explore with systematic error discus to highlight the accuracy of the experiment the michelson interferometer be an extremely precise instrument which have application in physic such a detect gravitational wave and fourier-transform spectroscopy of which the latter be the core of this experiment 1 interferograms can be generate where the light intensity at each wavelength can be analyse the main aim of this experiment be to construct and use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer this be then use to investigate the spectrum of light source with different spectral composition through the interferograms that be create light source analyse include a green laser white lead blue lead and a tungsten white light with and without a green filter property explore include the null point mean wavelength coherence length spectral width and temperature in this instrument light travel from the source to the beamsplitter where it be split into two beam due to the beamsplitter have a partially silver mirror on it face the two beam of light be then reflect off separate mirror and then merge to create an interference pattern at the detector which can be record a an interferogram and analyse a diagram illustrate the schematic of the michelson interferometer and how it work can be show in fig 1. the interference pattern be determine by the path difference of the two beam if the distance from both mirror to the beamsplitter be the same the two beam undergo constructive interference if the path difference differs by half a wavelength the two beam interfere destructively create a dark fringe move one mirror fractionally make the pattern on the detector move between light and dark fringe when the mirror be completely parallel to each other haidinger fringe be form which appear to be circular however if one mirror be tilt slightly fizeau fringe be form which be straight line 2 the layout and mechanism of the michelson interferometer this show the path that the two beam take orange and green before recombine at the beamsplitter again mirror m2 be able to move a distance which be inputted electronically and m1 be fix the dielectric plate creates a phase change for one beam which lead to destructive interference at zero path difference between the two beam by slowly move one mirror about a null point where there be zero path difference between the two beam the output appear a a series of light and dark fringe on an electronic interferogram for a single monochromatic wave fourier transform this into frequency space which display amplitude against wavelength creates a delta function to display the single wavelength if there be only two wavelength present the output on the detector a the mirror be move away from the null point be the result sum of the two sinusoidal intensity distribution with a path difference when these wave be in phase again the overall fringe pattern form be the same a it be at the null point however this only occurs when there be two wavelength if there be more wavelength present the fringe pattern will not be in phase at any other point other than the null point the wavelength spectrum can only be deduce from conduct a fourier transform on the interferogram 2 3 a source have a spectral width ∆ν which be the range of frequency emit by the source or the width of a single spectral line for that case the coherence length be the distance which the move mirror can move before the interferogram contrast becomes poor the wider the spectral line the narrower the interferogram ∆ν can be found from where l be the coherence length m ∆ ν be the spectral width hz this can be change into wavelength use where λ be the mean wavelength 2 4 when a gaussian be fit to the fourier transform interferogram the fwhm of the gaussian be equal to ∆λ where wein 's displacement law can be use to deduce the temperature of a blackbody where t be the temperature k and λ peak be the mean wavelength m 5 after building the interferometer it be then necessary to align it use a green laser a the source we make sure that the laser spot be initially align at the move mirror m2 by block out the stationary mirror m1 this be repeat the other way round it be ensure that the laser beam be parallel to the table surface by make sure that the mirror and beam splitter be at the same height and perpendicular to the table surface two laser spot be form at the detector so we then tilt mirror m1 slightly until they overlap directly at the detector a lense with a focal length of 25mm be place in front of the laser to enlarge the beam and then a lense with a focal length of 100mm be place after the beamsplitter so the fringe could be see the mirror be tilt such that either a light or dark fringe sat in the middle of the detector if this be not the case when the other mirror move it would have take an average of fringe and the interferogram would have be constant the photodetector connect at the output of the interferometer be connect to the pc and the usb port set to low latency a it be attach to an amplifier the gain of the amplifier have to be adjust so that there be no clip on the interferogram when take data we be require to input the position we want the mirror to move to in mm the rate at which we want the stage to move in mm/s and the number of sample that we want to take we trialled the rate at 0.025 mm/s which be estimate use sample size the 50hz sample rate and the distance move after far experimentation we discover that the mirror might have be move too fast a we do n't achieve a sinusoidal form of fringe if the rate be too high the mirror create it 's own vibration which destroyed fringe therefore we calculate the maximum rate that the stage could move use the wavelength of a green laser the detector sample at 50hz and the fact that we want to collect data at least every quarter wavelength this come to a maximum rate of 0.005 mm/s we then low the rate to 0.002 mm/s to ensure that the stage be move slow enough and saw that the interferograms be much well we try to find the null point within 1-2mm use the green laser this be locate at the peak of the wavepacket on the interferogram where there be complete constructive interference start from one end of the stage and move the mirror a small amount we discover a peak and thought it be the null point however after take a large range we discover that there be a beating effect so this may not have be the null point therefore we use a different method with a slow rate of 0.001 mm/s and realign the interferometer we start from one end of the stage and scan a small distance look at the interference pattern when move towards the null point the circular fringe go in towards the centre but when move away from the null point the circular fringe move away from the centre we scan small range and then deduce a small range in which the fringe change direction with the null point range found we replace the source with a white lead source we scan through a small range that contain the null point and observe the interference pattern this be do at a rate of 0.001mm/s with 10 000 sample we repeat this with a blue lead and a white light tungsten source with and without a green filter these interferograms be analyse to find the mean wavelength of the source the coherence length spectral width and temperature for the tungsten source fourier transforms of the interferograms be also take in order to display the wavelength spectrum in frequency space mean wavelength be obtain by measure the length between several wavelength on the interferogram and then divide by the number of wavelength coherence length be measure use the interferogram to deduce the distance between the point where there be poor contrast and the fringe be no longer sinusoidal however result from this method be in the wrong order of magnitude therefore we decide to plot gaussian fit use python onto the fourier transform graph to determine the fwhm from σ in order to obtain the spectral width ∆λ equation 1 and 2 be then use to deduce coherence length the null point be found between -0.9mm and -0.7mm but more precisely at about -0.86 ± 0.01 mm this be found by move the stage extremely slowly between small range within -0.9mm and -0.7mm the result for the characteristic of the different light source be displayed in table 1. it be discover that the stage do not move linearly between sample and that this would lead to systematic error in result the interferogram of white light around the null point be show in fig 2. this agrees with the theory such that there be only constructive interference between all wavelength at the null point so this be the only point where white light fringe be found at all other point all the wavelength be never completely in phase after fourier transform the interferogram the result wavelength spectrum can be show in fig 3 it be important to remove the offset which be create by the background noise before conduct the fourier transform this offset level be see from the value that the stable line of the interferogram be at instead of zero which for white light be 88 000 arbitrary unit compare the mean wavelength obtain in table 1 to the theoretical value of 575 nm which lie within the uncertainty this value only have a 0.87 error 6 the spectral width value be slightly small than it should be when look at the fwhm of the graph in fig 3 where it can be estimate to be about 200nm therefore the main error in our result be due to the fact that the spectrum do n't actually display a gaussian shape and the gaussian fit could be big and wider the interferogram obtain for the blue lead be displayed in fig 4. the fourier transform interferogram can be show in fig 5 where an offset of 15 000 arbitrary unit have be remove compare the mean wavelength obtain in table 1 to the theoretical value of 475 nm which lie within the uncertainty this value only have a 0.42 error the spectral width value we obtain be fairly accurate since look at fig 5 it can be estimate to be about 35nm from the fwhm of the original curve without the gaussian fit this be because the blue lead display a more gaussian-like curve this spectral width be also small than that of white light a expect due to it have a wider interferogram the interferogram obtain for the tungsten white light source be displayed in fig 6 with it 's fourier transform displayed in fig 7. a large offset of 650 000 be remove from this the spectrum look similar to the theoretical spectrum however shorter due to the photodetector only be sensitive to the visible region 7 compare the mean wavelength obtain in table 1 to the theoretical value of about 840nm which lie within the uncertainty there be only a 3 error the change in the mean wavelength from the white lead to the tungsten lamp fig 5. the fourier transform to frequency space of the blue lead interferogram with the gaussian fit this spectrum be a lot narrower than the white lead spectrum due to the interferogram be wider demonstrates the shift from visible light to infrared thus display tungsten 's black body property the spectral width value be small than it should be when look at fig 7 where it can be estimate to be about 300nm this could be due to the spectrum not actually display a gaussian shape but a black body shape tungsten light source exhibit black body emission profile and the temperature of the source at the emission of the peak wavelength can be found use equation 4. this give a value of 3560 k. theoretically this should be around 3200k so this value only have a 11 error 7 the interferogram obtain from the white light tungsten source with a green filter be displayed in fig 8. the narrow bandwidth of the green filter widens the coherence length of the interfere light which the result in table 1 agree with a the coherence length obtain for the tungsten with the green filter be great than without the filter there be also some beating in the interferogram perhaps due to there be two frequency very close together after passing through the filter the fourier transform of the interferogram be show in fig 9 with a offset of 20 000 arbitrary unit have be remove from this the spectral width can be estimate to be 70nm therefore the result we obtain in table 1 be much small however it can clearly be see that the fourier transform spectrum do not have a gaussian shape at all especially since it be part of a white spectrum slope therefore plot a gaussian be inaccurate and maybe two or three gaussians on each spike would have be well the spike be due to the green filter reduce intensity by reduce the number of frequency that can pa through however this gaussian may be useful if one desire to manufacture a product that rely on a coherence length derive from the σ value the mean wavelength in table 1 compare to a theoretical value of about 544nm which lie within the uncertainty in our value other error in the result could be due to the uncertainty in the green filter specification a it claimed to have a central wavelength at 543.5 ± 2 nm and a fwhm at 10 ± 2nm 8 however these be very small uncertainty so can be consider negligible v. conclusion ultimately the michelson interferometer be successfully use a a spectrometer to perform fourier spectroscopy in order to characterise different light source and filter although the result be consistent with the theory they be n't completely accurate systematic error in result obtain be either due to the non linear movement of the stage or the interferometer not be perfectly align error in the spectral width additionally would have be cause by the error in use a gaussian fit to a non-gaussian plot this could have result in the spectral width obtain all be small than they should have be to improve we could try to quantify the variation in the stage 's movement to reduce systematic error and improve result we also could plot gaussian fit to the interferograms rather than the fourier transforms a these displayed more of a gaussian fit,superficial,the
129,2ndINT_SUY577_Redacted,this meant that the tungsten source emit the large range of frequency follow by the white lead the blue lead and lastly the tungsten source with a green filter which emit a very narrow range of frequency a michelson interferometer be a device which split an incident light source into two equal amplitude beam the interferometer be align such that the two beam recombine and interfere result in an interference pattern the instrument be invent by a. michelson in 1887 1 the operation of a michelson interferometer and it use a a spectrometer be explain in detail in section ii michelson interferometer have a wide range of application include stellar measurement detection of gravitational wave and in optical fibre for the purpose of this experiment a michelson interferometer be use a a spectrometer the main aim of this experiment be to quantitatively analyse the spectrum from a variety of different light source this meant determine value for certain property of the source such a their mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width these be define in section ii a green laser be use to align the interferometer until clear visible fringe could be see at the photodiode detector this be necessary a without the presence of an interference pattern useful interferograms could not be record this experiment also aim to give an understand of the construction of a michelson interferometer and obtain interferograms for a variety of different light source include a white lead a blue lead and a white light tungsten source 2 the mirror m2 be fix the mirror m1 be movable so that the optical path difference between the two beam can be varied the variable t describes the difference in distance between the two arm of the interferometer m2 simply refers to the apparent position of mirror 2 when view by an observer in a michelson interferometer the incident light beam travel towards the beamsplitter where approximately half of it be reflect the other half be transmit the two beam take different path which be orthogonal to each other both beam be reflect and travel back towards the beamsplitter where they recombine and produce an interference pattern at the detector this interference pattern be dependent upon the difference in distance travel by the two beam if the distance travel by the two beam be exactly equal then they should be in phase and a such should intefere constructively result in a bright fringe on the interference pattern however this be not the case because of the presence of a dielectric plate a see in figure 2.1. the dielectric plate introduces a phase shift to one of the beam meaning that they instead interfere destructively when the path difference be zero result in a dark fringe on the interference pattern the michelson interferometer can be apply a a spectrometer when the difference in length of it arm be close to zero this position where the variable t 0 be know a the null point when use the michelson interferometer a a spectrometer it be often refer to a a fourier transform spectrometer 3 4 the michelson interferometer can be use to take interferograms of various source by simply move one of the mirror very slowly around the null point from these interferograms it be possible to determine certain characteristic about the incident source namely the mean wavelength of the source it coherence length and spectral width the mean wavelength for a source be define a simply an average of all the wavelength emit by the source the coherence length in term of the michelson interferometer be the distance over which one mirror of the interferometer can be move before the contrast on the interferogram becomes poor or the point at which the signal stop be sinusoidal on the interferogram the spectral width of a source show the spread of frequency it emits the spectral width of a source be related to it coherence length by the equation 2 δ𝜈 × 𝐿 𝑐 2𝜋 1 where δν be the spectral width in hz l be the coherence length in m and c be the speed of light it be the clear from 1 that the coherence length and spectral width be inversely proportional the large the coherence length of a source the small it spectral width these characteristic property will vary for different light source a they have slightly different way of emit light for example an lead do not emit light in the same way a a tungsten source however the exact detail of how these source emit light will not be discus in any detail in this report iii method the setup of the michelson interferometer in this experiment be very similar to that show in figure 2.1. however mirror 1 be mount onto a motorise stage which could move at a very slow speed the motorise stage be quote to be accurate to the micron the michelson interferometer be initially align use a green laser this be because the light from the laser be very close to be monochromatic make it easy to see interference fringe at the detector a lens with a focal length of 25.4mm be use to make the laser into an extend source the tilt of mirror 2 be adjust to align the spectrometer both straight line fizeau fringe and circular haidinger fringe be observe during the alignment to record the interferograms a photodiode detector connect via usb to a computer be instal on the right side of figure 3.1. at first large random spike be observe in the interferogram but this issue be resolve by switch the usb port to low latency mode to use the michelson interferometer a a spectrometer interferograms need to be record around the null point the null point be locate by take advantage of a property of the circular fringe involve their switch between sinking and source either side of it the null point be found to be at -0.9494 ± 0.0005 mm interferograms be then take for each source use the mirror mount on the movable stage for the white lead an interferogram be take over a range from -0.955 mm to -0.942 mm at a speed of 0.001 mm/s the motorise stage be quote to take 50 data point per second the uncertainty in the motorise stage be discus in section iv range and speed for other source can be see in figure 3 histogram of the spread of wavelength present in the source be generate from the interferograms use a computer algorithm use these alongside the interferograms it be possible to determine value for the mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width for each of the source the interferogram for the white lead be show in at first glance it can immediately be see that the coherence length for the white lead will be small judging from the narrow gaussian shape of figure 4.1 a the shape of the interferogram be expect to be small because there be many wavelength present in the incident source result in more destructive interference narrow the peak significantly due to the inverse relationship see earlier in 1 it be expect that the spectral width will be large and this be confirm by the sheer number of peak see in look at figure 4.2 a it clearly have a much wider gaussian distribution shape than that of figure 4.1 a this be an expect result a the blue lead emits a much small range of frequency compare with that of the white lead the small range of frequency mean that the spectral width for the blue lead be much small than that of the white lead refer to 1 again a small spectral width result in a large coherence length explain the shape of the green filter add a filter to the tungsten source broadens the shape of the gaussian envelope hugely there be now less frequency present in the light source at the detector so there be much less interference because the beam be much closer in wavelength the mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width be displayed in figure 4.5. ultimately the data in figure 4.5 suggests that the tungsten source emits the large range of frequency a it have the large spectral width and inversely the small coherence length the mean wavelength for the blue lead and the tungsten source with green filter do in general agree with accepted value of wavelength for light of that colour this suggests that the data be accurate to an extent the value do tend to agree with our expectation a for example we would expect to see a small spectral width for the blue lead a it be only emit blue light which have a wavelength range of approximately 450nm -490nm upon far investigation of the accuracy of the motorise stage it be found that after take 20 random consecutive sample and calculate the distance between them it be indeed accurate to the micron allow u to use this a our systematic error when find the coherence length the main purpose of this experiment be to investigate the characteristic of certain light source and to quantitatively analyse their spectrum use their interferograms this experiment use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer this involve use the movable mirror close to the null point of the interferometer to obtain suitable interferograms for the different source their mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width could then be determine the tungsten source with no filter prove to emit a very large range of frequency it have the large spectral width 40 ± 30 thz and the small coherence length 1.2 ± 1 μm conversely the tungsten source with a green filter result in a very narrow range of frequency the tungsten source with a green filter have a coherence length of 40 ± 1 μm and spectral width of 1.2 ± 0.03 thz the application of the filter to the tungsten result in a significant change in the coherence length and spectral width of the source the change be so dramatic perhaps because there be a single narrow green line in the spectrum of tungsten this experiment could perhaps be extend to other source of light such a a sodium lamp which be commonly use in street light investigation of the zeeman effect could also be a source of extension to the experiment,superficial,none

and first use in the well-known experiment `` michelson-morley experiment `` to find the present of ether today it cover from find the tiny variation of microscopic organism to detect gravitational wave in the universe 1 the layout of the interferometer we use in the experiment be quite simple and be illustrate in figure 1. beam splitter play a very important role in the interferometer that it split the light into two beam and allows beam to recombine and interfere the main principle of the interferometer be that we can get different pattern of interference by adjust the position of the move miffor to change the phase difference between two beam and use laser white lead tungsten lamp with yellow and green filter a resource the dielectric plate make sure that the phase difference between two beam of light be reduce and equivalent to the path difference then we can easily govern the phase difference between light beam by just adjust the position of the move miitor in this experiment we firstly simulated the interferograms of laser and white lead light and use interferometer to understand the interferograms of different light source then obtain the spectmms by apply fourier transform when two wave travel in the same or opposite direction they will interfere and the amplitude of the new wave be the sum of amplitude of each wave the pattem of the interference depends on the phase difference of two wave figure .2 show the path of two beam in the interferometer ml and m2 be two murnrs where m2 can move t be the distance between miitor-s. the path difference of two beam be ab+bd in the figure and we can simply show that the path difference be 2t co e by consider hence the equation which govems the angle e be 2tcose mil 3 where m be integer and when m be odd dark fringe observe while m be even bright fringe observe from the equation we can see when t and 1 remain constant beam with same incident angle form the correspond number of fringe so the interference pattem should be ring-shaped from the equation3 we can derive the fonnula 2t « sm tsin0o0 4 for the same « sm 60 be small correspond to the large 0 that mean the pattems get denser at the outer of the ring by consider these two we can predict the pattem on the detector should be same a figure3 and the interferogram be just the sinusoidal function interferogram be just a representation of the amplitude change with time and to detennine the spectmms oflight source we need to fourier transfo1m the time domain interferograms to frequency domain spectmm 2 the fourier transfo1m g f of a time domain signal g t be obtain by g t f 9 t e 2 1rift dt 5 by just consider the light with single frequency 0 9 t cosf 0 t thus hence we get that the fourier transfo1m of single frequency light be an impulse at 0 show m fig 5 a michelson interferometer have be construct a show in figurel light be emit from the source and be split into two beam by a beam splitter pa1tially silver mi11'0r one beam travel to the move miiror and be reflect the other transmit beam travel to the fix mirror and be reflect back both beam be pa1tially reflect and recombine at the beam splitter two beam be from the same source therefore theii-phases be highly correlate the move stage that use to construct the move miiror be connect to and conti•olled by the computer after the apparatus be set up laser be use a light source to align the interferometer the laser beam create a small spot on the detector which be hard to see hence a lens be inse1t ed betv.•een the laser and the beam splitter to make the spot large we adjust the position height and angle of the fix 1niiror first and make the spot of the laser strike at the centre of the mi11'0r the beam reflect to the move miitor be not concentrate at right angle by consider movmg stage and the beam splitter be fix on the board we put a small piece of paper under the left half of the beam splitter we use a magnetic ruler to ensure all apparatus be in the same height and the fix mi11'0r and the move miitor be perpendicular to each other an interference pattem of dark and bright frmges be see on card board screen and show in figure 8. the pattem see be in line with our expectation show in figure 3 so the inte1ferometer be align because it be quite difficult to align the inte1ferometer and keep the distance from beam splitter to fix/moving mirror we measure these two distance after align the distance from beam splitter to fix miitor be 14.8mm and to move miiror at origin be 14.4mm so our null point should be around -4llllll instead of 0mm the photodetector be instal at the output of the interferometer and connect to pc the photodetector be a photodiode attach to a variable-gain amplifier 4 a the interferometer be align we use white lead to find the null point a mention before the null point should be around the position at -4mm so we choose to record the data from -3 to -5mm figure 9 be the graph obtain and it show that the null point be very close to -4.07mm the first set of data be take by use laser in the range from -4 to 1mm and mittor move at speed 0.0lmm/s the experitnent be repeat by use laser white lead blue lead and tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter with different range and move speed we get the interferogram and spectmm oflaser from our first set of data a figme 10 and 11. the inte1ferogram of laser show a periodic sinusoidal function because it contains only one single frequency with bright and dark fringe altematively the wavelength show in graph be around 265nm but accord to equation 3 the wavelength should be double of that which be 530nm the white lead have already be use to take one set of data so to make it more accurate we record the data in a small range from -4.066 to -4 .076mm with low speed 0.0002mm/s figme 12 and 13 be the interferogram and spectrum respectively of this measurement compare the spectmm in figurel4 that we simulated before the experiment the spectrum we plot from the data be quite accurate the spectrum illustrates that the light source use be warm white lead because the intensity of red light be high than blue light there be a peak at blue light because blue light have a relative high energy from the spectrum we deduce that the mean wavelength of white lead be 620nm and the coherence length be 4um the procedure of use blue lead a light source be quite sitnilar to the white lead and we chose the range from -4 .04 to -4. l mm at move speed 0.000l mm/s figure 15 depicts the interferogram of blue light which be a sitnple beating pattern a it contains a ve1y small range of wavelength from the spectrnm figure 16 we can see the mean wavelength of blue lead be around 490nm which be ve1y close to the theoretical value and the coherence length be 20um for the tungsten source with yellow and green filter the mi1tor move from -4.0 to -4.0 15mm with the speed 0.000 15mm/s the interferograms of tungsten light with yellow and green filter be ve1y similar to each other and highly symmetry show in figure 17 the shape of spectnuns of these two light sow•ces be similar a w ell but with different wavelength due to the colow• of filter be different figure 18 and 19 present the 4 spectrum of tungsten with yellow and green filter respectively accord to the wavelength of yellow light the yellow filter can only pa the light that wavelength within the range from 560mm to 630mm which can be prove by the spectrum the mean wavelength of yellow filter be 600nm and the coherence length be 0.1 1mm -fig 18 the spectrum of hmgsten light w ith yellow filter the wave in the range from 500-600mm could be so1t out by the green filter so the range of wavelength in the spectrum should be in that range the mean wavelength of green filter be 560run and coherence length be 0.09mm figure 19 be the spectrum of tungsten light with green filter fig 19 the spectrum of tungsten light with g reen filter we use the fo1mula to calculate the spectral v.iidth of each light source where /j.v be the spectral width and l be the coherence length the spectral width of white lead blue lead tungsten light with yellow and green filter be 1.19 x 10 13 hz 2.39 x 10 1 2 hz 4.34 x 10 1 1 hz and 5.31 x 10 11 hz respectively by consider w iens displacement law ta.peak 2.898 x 10 3 8 where a.peak be mean wavelength and t be the temperature we find the temperature of tungsten filament be 4997k the result of the experiment do not completely fit our expectation and simulation there be many factor affect the accuracy of the experiment like the two miirnr ml and m2 be not absolute parallel to each other so there may be a very small angle between them the detector be also very easy to be affected also the fix min-or and the move mirror not perpendicular to each other may cause the uncertainty a well during the experiment we found that a very soft knock on table and cough can cause the amplitude in the interferogram change dramatically this experiment be design to investigate the principle of michelson interferometer analyze the property of the interferograms and spectrum of interference with laser white lead blue lead tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter a light source and also find their mean wavelength and spectral width respectively the interferometer be simply split the light emit from the source by beam splitter and use mirror to reflect these two beam to make them interfere when they back to the beam splitter by change the position of the move mirror the interference pattern will change and the interferogram can be obtain the result of the experiment nearly fit our expectation and the simulation before take the data the interferograms and spectrum of each light source we get be also similar to the theoretical shape from the graph we obtain we find the mean wavelength coherence length and hence calculate the spectral width of each light source which be show in table 1. the temperature of tungsten lamp be be calculate a 4997k by use the wiens displacement law this experiment help u to realise the interferograms and the spectrum of each light source and also the use of the michelson interferometer although the experiment be relative success there be still many source of uncertainty to improve the experiment the detector should be totally fix to avoid the effect of some vibration of the desk to make the experiment simple the distance between the beam splitter to the two mirror should be the same but we do not adjust properly for convenience,superficial,the
131,2ndINT_LUU804_Redacted,the wavelength spectrum and coherence length of three light sources-a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten white-light incandescent source-were measure these measurement be conduct use a michelson interferometer and analyze use fitting both gaussian and sinusoidal plot to the interferograms produce for each source the average wavelength and coherence length be respectively 470 ± 3 nm and 1.20 ± 0.05 mm for the white lead 445.0 ± 0.3 nm and 2.71 ± 0.02 mm for the blue lead and 1116 ± 11 nm and 1.26 ± 0.06 for the tungsten source possible source of error in our measurement include noise due to our error in set up and adjust the equipment and external vibration effect the position of both mirror use the michelson interferometer be a tool developed in 1881 by albert michelson he intend to use it to measure change in the speed of light and resolve a dispute surround the motion of the luminiferous aether the medium through which light be thought to travel 1 these change be never observe despite the experiment be more than accurate enough to measure them there be no theory at the time congruous with this result however in 1905 albert einstein provide a theory of light without the need for any aether neatly explain michelson 's result there be need to explain why the aether be n't move there simply be n't any aether at all 2 the immense accuracy of this result despite it 's experimenter work of an entirely wrong assumption show the potential power of the michelson interferometer a a tool for precise measurement the setup of such an interferometer consists of a light source two mirror a detector and a beamsplitter arrange a in fig 1. light enters the beamsplitter from the source bounce off both mirror return to the beamsplitter and interferes with itself produce a unique pattern of fringe project onto and measure by the detector the adjustable mirror m1 can be use to alter the path difference between the two possible track light can take though the apparatus and so 'scan through the interference pattern produce this tool can be use in different configuration for experiment across optic but in our specific experiment we use a michelson interferometer to measure the wavelength spectrum and coherence length of several different light source namely a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten incandescent source we chose to measure coherence length the distance over which light remains aove a certain level of coherence a it be incredibly important in optical communication it be use in order to quantify the degree of coherence a piece of equipment need in order to measure accurate result and asa guide to the level of alignment need to send data with a reasonable amount of loss 3 the wavelength spectrum of each source be also measure to gain more information about the different light source and understand the work and potential problem with the use of these three different type of source ii theory for any initial intensity spectrum i i σ the displayed spectrum i f x where x be the path difference between the path take by each beam of the light through the interferometer be where and λ be the wavelength of the source 4 5 equation 1 can be compare to the cosine representation of a fourier transform lead to the result hence to obtain the wavelength spectrum of the original source it be possible to simply inverse fourier transform the final displayed spectrum the typical form of i f close to it 's null point where x 0 consists of sinusoidal fringe contain in a gaussian envelope the spectral width δ of the source be closely related to the fwhm of this gaussian envelope through this fwhm be obtain by identify the maximum value of the gaussian then find the difference between the x-values that lead to a y-value of half the maximum the spectral width be link to the coherence length l coh of the source by the simple relation we set up our equipment a in fig 1 guide by our knowledge of the michelson interferometer a photo of our experiment without the light-proof box that surround it to cut out external light be visible a fig 2. we align the interferometer use the green laser a our source and alter the tilt and position of our fix mirror m2 in fig 1 until haldinger circular fringe be visible at the detector 's position we ensure to centre these circular fringe each time we re-aligned the experiment in order to keep our result consistant the green laser be also use to estimate of the position of the adjustable mirror m1 that lead to a zero-path difference between the two possible path through the interferometer and so to the appearance of the null point in our reading the green laser be monochromatic and so it fringe be visible across the range of position possible for m1 this meant that it be possible to take large-scale measurement of the pattern and thus estimate the position of the null point the other source provide be not monochromatic and so the amplitude of their fringe decrease rapidly on either side of the null point until it be impossible to see any fringe outside of an 0.1-mm range surround the null point this make it exceptionally difficult to pinpoint the null point use other source than the green laser without preliminary estimation of it 's position to estimate the position of the null point we first remove the detector from our setup replace it with a piece of plain white card this simplify the process of counting fringe a computational method be not need a the fringe be visible to the naked eye next we move m1 across a wide range of position most typically from -5mm to 5mm take measurement every 1mm to take measurement we first center the fringe pattern onto a small pencil mark on the card then count the number of fringe visible in the pattern move outwards from the centre of the pattern this fringe count would typically dip until it reach a minimum of 1 or 2 fringe and then rise the minimum number of fringe correspond to the null point of the interferometer but a the green laser 's fringe be so wide an accurate measurement be not possible to obtain a more accurate measurement we 'd replace the green laser with whichever of the source we wish to study and take wide measurement about the estimate null point we look for the characteristic behaviour of the source about the true null point where fringe would appear and quickly fade away once we have preliminary data and thus a more accurate value for the position of the null point we would fig 2. this figure be a photograph of our experimental setup show with the green laser in place and power up the lid and two wall of the light-proof box surround our interferometer have be remove to allow the photograph to be take when use more diffuse source such a the white-light lead the dark piece of card would be place to surround the lead and block nay reflection from reach the detector move the mirror slowly across the null point take detailed measurement of the source 's interferogram once we have a detailed interferogram show the behaviour of our chosen source at it 's null point we use computational method to analyse it in two different way to produce a wavelength spectrum first a described in equation 3 we take it 's fourier transform secondly we split the interferomegram into several section fitting each section to a sinusoid a histogram of the wavelength of these sinusoid be take and treat a a wavelength spectrum of the original light source to find the coherence length of the source we analyse the interferogram in a different way fitting it 's overall shape to a gaussian the fwhm of this gaussian could be analyse a in equation 4 and 5 to find the coherence length of the source our result be show in figure 4 6 and 8 a well a table i. the value in table i be the one calculate use a sinusoidal fit to the data to estimate the wavelength instead of rely on the fourier transform of the data a the data collect use the fit be closer to the physical reality of the situation a can be see by compare fig 3 which show an idealise measurement of the spectrum of a white-light lead fig 4b the fourier plot of the wavelength spectrum and fig 4c the histogram of fit wavelength value fig 4b do not show the twin-peak behaviour expect and it 's peak be at a much low wavelength than expect whilst fig 4c show the narrow-to-wide behaviour expect and give a mean wavelength of 470nm between the two 'peaks but weight toward the large peak a expect the data from the blue lead fig 6 show a similar effect fig 5 show an idealise blue lead spectrum contain two peak one at around 460nm and a small one at around 625nm the fourier-analysed data fig 6b do not show any sign of a peak in the 600nm range and instead peak at around 530nm much high than expect with a secondary shallower peak at 470mn this graph do not physically fit with the result we expect the second analysis perform on the data use sinusoidal fit instead of a fourier transform be slightly more in line with the expect result this result show in fig 6c contains a peak at 510nm with a close secondary peak at around 460nm some value be distribute much low at value around 100-300nm but these be vestige of an imperfect fit to the data and so be not physical effect and can be discount the data from the tungsten effervescent source fig 8 seem slightly more accurate the idealise spectrum fig 7 show a very broad peak with it 's maximum value around 1200nm the fourier tranform analytic method result in fig 8b which peak around 470nm extremely low consider the fact that this source be incandescent and so should peak in the uv region of the em spectrum a the idealise spectrum do fortunately the second analytic method use a sinusoidal fit result in fig 8c which peak around 1050nm and even appear to have the same uneven shape a the idealise spectrum with the peak skewed towards the low wavelength we found the coherence length of each of the source by find the fwhm of the interferograms of each source use equation 4 to find the spectral width then substitute into equation 5. our error in coherence length be calculate use the covarience matrix of our gaussian fit to the data other error be estimate due to the inaccuracy we found whilst measure the data we found that the adjustable mirror be inaccurate at speed less that 1 micron per second a the slow motion lead the mirror to wobble lead to a lot of noise in our data and an inability to see the fringe accurately we estimate the power of this effect by perform a set of measurement without move the mirror lead to the result displayed in fig 9. we also observe that the motion of the mirror be extremely susceptible to outside vibration such a our sit down onto our stool at the lab bench beside the apparatus or write in our lab book on the desk that held the apparatus both of these action cause significant spike of noise in our preliminary data and so when take final data we ensures to remain a still a possible in order to avoid the influence of outside vibration on the mirror motion a much a possible we also found it difficult to keep the apparatus in alignment and take meaningful result often when we switch the light source from the green laser use for alignment to a different source the action of unscrew the old source and place the new source into position perturbed the equipment enough to knock the mirror and beam-splitter out of alignment v. summary we perform this experiment with the aim to determine the average wavelength and coherence length for several different light source we achieve this aim measure both value for three separate source compare our result to idealise spectrum for each source our result show a similar wavelength spectrum for each source and any discrepancy can be explain due to problem with the apparatus and with the fit of the sinusoidal curve to the interferometer the value we obtain for the coherence length of each source seem rather high and with rather small error this may be due to the fact that the error use of the coherence length related to the accuracy of the gaussian fit to the data and not the accuracy of the data itself the experiment could be improve by isolate the apparatus from external vibration entirely to eliminate the noise cause by for example walk past the apparatus while measurement be be take this problem could also be address by isolate the apparatus entirely for example in a separate room from the experimenter whilst measurement be be take well result could also have be attain through meticulous attention to the fit of each dataset but in our case time constraint disallowed this possibility,extended,bal
132,2ndINT_WHP087_Redacted,the experiment be conduct to measure the spectrum of the white lead blue lead and tungsten lamp with yellow and green filter use michelson interferometer a a fourier

interferogram of each light source be create from the detector by set the stage to move forward and backward to change the distance light travel for each interferogram the fourier transform be perform to extract the power spectrum on wavelength and power spectrum be analyse information within electromagnetic wave or light normally be difficult to be observe due to their high speed small scale and high uncertainty but em wave posse a wave-like-property interference with this property the microscopic scale of em wave can be magnify into observable and stable fringe macroscopic interference pattern interferometer utilize interference can be use to measure observables in a microscopic preciseness for example distance wavelength and dielectric constant due to the disturbance of gravitation on the propagation of em wave interferometer can also be exploit a a gravitational wave detector one of the famous detector be know a ligo interferometer split a beam of em wave into several different beam usually two that travel different route and end up meeting and interfere with each other project an interference pattern the interferogram be the graph of interference amplitude a a function of the difference in distance that beam travel can be use to extract information about the difference in phase shift between beam that travel in different route therefore for a monochromatic wave from the phase shift the difference in distance give the wavelength of em wave use or the wavelength give the difference in distance em wave travel can be measure michelson interferometer design by albert abraham michelson be use in this experiment it be use a a solid prove that the speed of light be constant and invariant from different the direction the light travel the interferometer contains a beam splitter that split light beam toward to two vertical arm both beam be reflect by mirror to travel back to the beam splitter where they interfere this will be explain far in the method part spectrometer be equipment that decompose and measure the wavelength from an input light interferometer a mention previously can be use to measure the wavelength of a monochromatic wave for non-ideal wave contain a spectrum of wave length can be decompose and measure by apply fourier transform on the interferogram which give the distribution of the wavelength of the light therefore interferometer can be use a a spectrometer this be call fourier transform spectrometer a monochromatic wave with wave number 𝑘 can be express a a function of distance the light travel or in complex form where 𝑔 𝑥 be the amplitude normally a wave be the combination with infinite monochromatic wave with different amplitude and wavelength the wave function of the wave can be write in and accord to inverse fourier

δx 𝜓 ̃ 𝑥 𝑔 𝑘 𝑒 𝑖𝑘𝑥 1 𝑒 𝑖𝑘𝛿𝑥 5 where 𝛿𝑥 be the difference in distance two wave travel the intensity therefore give by the intensity of all wave combine can be express a 𝐼 𝛿𝑥 be the interferogram intensity of interference a a function of the difference in distance light travel take inverse cosine fourier transform 3 𝑔 2 𝑘 𝐴 ∫ 𝐼 𝛿𝑥 co 𝑘𝛿𝑥 𝑑𝛿𝑥 𝛿 𝑘 the case of k=0 be not consider hence the delta function can be ignore this give back the power spectrum compare use equation 4 equation 9 be easy to be act in interferometry the distance light travel be give by two time the difference between mirror t therefore normally the spectrum of a light source can be approximate a one or multiple gaussian function so the interferogram should look like 𝑟𝑒|ℱ 𝑒 where 𝜇 𝑘 be the mean wave number 𝜎 𝑘 and 𝜎 𝛿𝑥 be the standard deviation of the distribution and obeys this describes the interferogram a a cosine wave with the two time the period equal the mean wavelength of the spectrum and have a envelop shape like gaussian function i k can be approximate a a gaussian distribution equation 11 show the wave packet of 𝐼 𝛿𝑥 be close to gaussian distribution a well and two distribution share a standard deviation relationship of described by equation 12 the wave number and coherence length be take a full width half amplitude δ𝑘 and l and their relation be consider to the propagation of error where δ𝜆 be the uncertainty on wavelength therefore the relation between δ𝜆 and coherence length can be express a 2𝜋𝐿 15 since the more data mean the more processing on data sometimes the less data acquire the well however if data be not enough aliasing might occur a show in figure 3 nyquist theorem describes the maximum separation between two data that could avoid data from be aliasing where t be the maximum sample distance a michelson interferometer a show in figure 4 contains a beam splitter which be a semi-transparent mirror that be capable of splitting a light beam into two vertical beam a mirror m1 on a stage the can be control by computer to move forward and backward a fix but adjustable mirror m and a light detector the light source be place at the in put of the light splitter the mirror m1 and the mirror m2 be place at the two outlet of the beam splitter with similar distance to the outlet and the detector be place on the other side of the splitter to m2 when the light source be turn on a half of the beam go through the semi-transparent mirror and travel to m1 and the other half be reflect by the semi-transparent mirror and travel toward m2 the beam travel toward m1 be reflect by m1 and travel back to the beam splitter where the beam be reflect by the semitransparent mirror to the detector the beam that travel to m2 be reflect back to the beam splitter where the beam passing through the semi-transparent mirror and reach the detector when both beam reflect back to meet at the splitter they interfere with each other project an interference pattern on the detector when record the interferogram the stage be set to move therefore change the difference in distance two beam travel and the detector be adjust to a proper gain to record the plot of intensity record by the detector against the position of m2 be plot which be the interferogram to take data base on the interferometer the calibration be require since the mirror stage be fix the splitter be need to be adjust first to ensure the beam reflect aim at the centre of the mirror m1 and be vertical to the surface of the mirror the green laser be turn on and a black board be place between the splitter and the detector two light spot appear on it s1 and s2 a show in figure 5 one have high intensity than the other the strong spot s1 be generate by the beam reflect from m1 the weaker spot s2 be due to the reflection with in the beam splitter the beam reflect with in the splitter be exactly vertical to the splitter therefore to align splitter with m1 splitter be move and turn to coincide s1 with s2 to align mirror m2 with the splitter m2 be move until the laser from the splitter aim at the centre of the mirror then m2 be tilt until the spot from m2 be approximately coincident with s2 the black board be remove and the detector be adjust so that the laser spot aim directly at the detector a 10mm focus lens be equip with the laser and the interference pattern show tilt m2 until the centre of the fringe be at the centre of the image the green laser be switch with the white lead the difference in distance between m1 and m2 to the splitter be measure and be within -1~-2mm the stage be set to move from -1mm to -2mm to generate the interferogram from the detector to find the null point where the distance that two beam travel be the same and the interference be the strong at this point the null point be found to be around -1.817mm the stage be move to the null point far recalibration with the green laser be do by tilt m2 to have the centre of the fringe in the middle when m1 be at the null point to avoid the change in alignment while m1 be move be the beam reflect by m1 s2 be the beam reflect within the splitter the light source be replace with white lead blue lead and tungsten light for tungsten light the green and yellow filter be place in the front of the detector for each case set the stage to move from -1 mm and 1 mm from the null point the detector be default to take 50 data per second accord to nyquist theorem the average maximum speed for the stage to move be 0.007mm/s the interferograms be plot and the fourier transforms on interferograms be plot the interferograms and fourier transforms on interferograms of white lead blue lead and tungsten lamp with yellow and green filter be show below for fourier transforms the wave number have be turn into wavelength the scale interferograms and fourier transforms be displace in the appendix a. a mention before em wave do not present to be monochromatic wave instead they be compose by wave with different wavelength and the power spectrum of wavelength be these fourier transforms of interferograms accord to equation 10 in figure 7 and figure 9 it can be conclude that the wavelength distribution of the blue lead and the tungsten lamp be approximately gaussian the tungsten light have a broad range in spectrum where 70 of the power distribute out of the visible range which be infer-red this mean that if a tungsten lamp be use a an illumination source nearly 70 of the power be waste and in visible range the spectrum skews to the large wave length therefore the overall color of a tungsten lamp present to be orange and since their spectrum be gaussian the shape of the interferogram be a described in equation 11 a cosine wave with the two time the period equal the mean wavelength of the spectrum and have a envelop shape like gaussian function and the coherence length take by the fwhm in this experiment be show below from figure 10 the shape of the wave packet of the interferogram be asymmetrical compare to blue lead and tungsten lamp this be because that the white lead have two peak a show in figure 11 the broad peak be consider to be two gaussian function red and green in superposition and the thin peak be close to the blue spectrum this can be told from table 1 that the large peak have a mean wavelength similar to the mean wavelength of red and green and small peak have a mean wavelength like blue this implies that the white lead be compose by three light source red green and blue in contrast with tungsten light the efficiency of white lead be much high due to it thin spectrum with most of the frequency in the visible range both interferograms and spectrum of the tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter be similar but different in width spectrum of both show a main peak in the middle and a few side peak with left side slightly high than right side accord to figure 12 to 15 the multiple peak could be the result of multiple band of filter that the filter do not just allow wave with one frequency range to go through but multiple of them generate small wave packet in the interferogram or this could be the result of noise or misalignment refer to the contrast to the tungsten lamp spectrum in figure 13 and 15 the asymmetrical amplitude of side peak from spectrum of green and yellow filter have a correlation to the slope of spectrum of tungsten lamp which be to say the side peak be from tungsten lamp a well instead of noise and misalignment this probably suggest that both filter use in the experiment be nonideal which do not just have one band the michelson interferometer can be use a a fourier transform interferometer to extract power spectrum on wavelength from interferogram light source be usually compose by one or more single light source for each single light source the power spectrum can be approximate a a gaussian function the wave packet of the interferogram generate by a light source in an interferometer be like gaussian function a well the period of the interferogram be the half of the mean wavelength and the width of both obeys uncertainty principle in the experiment it be notice that the intensity record from the detector shift up and down slightly from an experiment to another for the same light source with the same gain this be consider to be the fluctuation of the power of the light source also the null point be found to be shift from time to time a well in significant scale even with the identical experimental set up this could be due to various of factor like thermal expansion but these error do not disturb the experiment significantly interferograms of white and blue lead and tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter and it fourier transforms all interferograms and fourier transforms be in the same scale this can be use to compare the coherence length of the interferogram and fwhm of the spectrum,deep,the
133,2ndINT_PHU922_Redacted,interferometry be a vital experimental technique with application across various field include but not limited to optic astronomy particle physic and general and special relativity this technique produce very precise interferograms of an emit source which be use in analysis to determine essential property of the source here a standard michelson interferometer setup be utilised in conjunction with a fast fourier transform fft algorithm to determine the wavelength of the green emission line of a mercury hg discharge lamp an accurate value of 545nm be determine 1 the coherence length be calculate inaccurately 1 to be 5.3µm which be a good indicator that misalignment be a considerable issue in conjunction with other issue of uncertainty brought about by the source and the move arm of the interferometer this experiment reproduces the classic michelson interferometry setup this procedure be first use by michelson in 1880 's when investigate the archaic ether theory 2 provide a good alignment of component be achieve an extremely precise interferogram of a source can be produce from which accurate and precise value of wavelength and coherence length and other property of the source can be determine here it be use for the purpose of determine the wavelength of a mercury discharge lamp green emission line move mirror apparatus be use to vary the path difference in the interferometer and thus the intensity of the interferogram be measure a a function of position of the mirror for computational speed a fast fourier transform algorithm be utilised to retrieve wavelength spectrum from the measure interferogram we be successful in use this technique to determine a very accurate wavelength for the green emission line of a mercury discharge lamp a 545nm 1 despite this the determine coherence length of this source be greatly inaccurate at 5.3µm the michelson interferometer be base on the principle of interfere a light source with itself by splitting it along two separate path figure one from this diagram by consider the additional distance travel by the light ray between the beamsplitter and m1 it can be show that constructive interference be satisfied by 3 where θ be the angle between the incident light ray on the mirror and the normal to the face of that mirror the null point of an interferometer be define a the point of maximum interference i.e zero path difference or t 0 4 at this point the fringe be at a maximum space so for this reason the null point be use a the data take range the physical interference pattern be continuous however data be take in discretely with sample rate t to produce an interferogram the data set x n be define by 5 where a n x signifies the amplitude of the signal at a point x x 0 be an arbitrary start position and ẋ be the velocity of the move platform ẋt be therefore the distance move between data point therefore it be appropriate to utilise a fast fourier transform algorithm which utilises the discrete fourier transform f d define by 6 this convert the data into frequency ν space from which wavelength can be directly calculate the coherence length l of a source be give by 3 where λ be mean wavelength ∆λ be the spread in wavelength of the source and directly corresponds to the fwhm ≈ 2.335σ of the gaussian wavelength spectrum produce the apparatus be setup accord to figure 1 and show in figure 2. a thorlabs nexus damped optical breadboard be utilised to reduce the possibility of external vibration invade the experiment for the alignment process a thorlabs cps532 green laser with an ac050-008-a-ml collimation package be employ it intensity facilitates relatively easy observation of the light path through the spectrometer the high intensity also greatly increase the clarity of the interference pattern thorlabs sm1l20 lens tube be use to avoid light escape subsequently the light be direct along two orthogonal path one at 90°to the incident beam towards move mirror m1 where it have be reflect by the beamsplitter and the other at 180°towards a thorlabs km100 stationary mirror m2 the design facilitates the adjustment of the azimuthal projection where the light have be transmit by the beamsplitter m1 be attach to a thorlabs remotely operate move platform the two light beam be recombine at the beamsplitter and be direct at 270°from the source beam towards an osram sfh 2200 photodetector with adjustable gain opaque screen be place along the perimeter of the breadboard in conjunction with a lid to eradicate background light interference black polystyrene screen be position inside the experiment to block light escape from the source which would be detect a noise see figure two the breadboard construction allows these component to be fix securely in place to eliminate any chance of suffuse mechanical misalignment within the interferometer due to vibration and accidental impact when change light source upon complete a satisfactory alignment when the null point have be found detailed in section iii.b the light source be subsequently change to a penray mercury hg discharge lamp to investigate the green light emission line of this source a thorlabs fl543.5-10 green filter be place a show in figure two uv protective glass be worn because the hg lamp be a strong short wave uv emitter a green laser be again utilised a the source it intensity make plain-sight analysis of the null point easy a 'trial and error method be employ here to confirm it position by seek region where the haidinger fringe appear to move in certain direction and by observe the width of the fringe the direction in which they appear to move revers a m1 pas through t 0 and the fringe become considerably -- -+ -- -- -- -- i -- -- -- -- mechanical misalignment be one of the large hindrance in our experiment despite effort to optimise the alignment no confinnation can be make to detennine the quality of this alignment that be to say that the component can not be align mechanically to each other or to some numerical scale therefore there be a random error associate with mechanical alignment and crucially could not be remove or quantify the quality of experimentally produce interferograms be highly sensitive to this alignment so mechanical misalignment of component propagate strongly through into detennined property of a source the experimental method require the use of different source for various stage of the alignment process and also when determine the position of the null point despite our best effort to reduce the physical impact of change light source on the experiment component design especially that of the laser where it have to be screw in meant that some component would be force out of alignment thus it be found that component movement change the position of the null point on the order of several micron therefore it be often necessary to perfonn alignment check between measurement the null point subsequently move and a such it position have be determine frequently during the course of the experiment furthermore it be a necessity iii to remove and replace the move mirror between laboratory session which contribute towards a detrimental effect on the alignment on one occasion the null point move by 3mm hence any discrepancy in position of the null point in figure four and five in addition to this the level of intensity of the utilised source directly affect the clarity of the interference pattern a it becomes less clear with diminish intensity in the instance of the white source and the mercury lamp these source be considerably less intense than the green laser and their design cause some background light to escape in the experiment in spite of our best effort to limit this figure four be an interferogram of the null point use a white lead this demonstrates the aforementioned sensitivity the interference pattern be not symmetrical about the null point equation one suggests this should be exactly symmetrical about the null point another explanation for this asymmetric pattern be that the stage do not move in regular interval relative to it data take rate of j 50h z. this problem be discover during data analysis when it be found that the position record in the data file be not chronological for sequential data thus lead to the conclusion that at small programmed move velocity typically 10-3 mm/ s the motion of the stage be in fact not uniform and could be consider a design fault or the progressive effect of compone nt wear these error be unquantifiable and so their influence on the experiment be undeterminable however reference to figure four and five qualitatively it can be say that it would be significant if present figure five be an interferogram around the null point note the discrepancy in null point position between figure two and three use the mercury discharge lamp asymmetry be again a factor in judging the quality of this interferogram this problem be very clear and despite our attempt at realignment this could not be alleviate figure six the envelope of the wavelength spectral function this gaussian produce a value of λ 545nm which when compare to the true value of 546.1nm show that we be successful in determine a very accurate value 1 use the standard deviation retrieve from this gaussian the full width at half maximum fwhm wavelength spread be calculate a 56nm thus the coherence length be determine use equation four and a value of 5.3µm be determine the value of 5.3µm be two order of magnitude small than the expect value of ≈ 300µm 1 consider figure six the fwhm of the gaussian fit be of the order ten of nanometre which when use with λ in equation four give a result on order micro-metres not hundred of micro-metres a expect therefore consider the accuracy of the measure λ it be the ∆λ spread that be contribute to this greatly inaccurate value this issue therefore be a a result of the quality of the interferogram refer back to figure five there be considerable noise and asymmetry in the interferogram thus it be conclude that despite effort to achieve a satisfactory alignment ultimately it be not achieve and directly affected ∆λ moreover it be assume that this have propagate through the fast fourier transform into the wavelength spectrum and have cause it larger-than-expected width far still the irregularity in stage movement could have contribute to this assume it move with a mean velocity ẋ i.e the same a that programmed the random statistical deviation from this mean could have cause the large ∆λ but the statistic deviation average and cause the spectrum to average to the expect λ. despite determine an accurate value of 545nm for the wavelength of the green line emission from a mercury discharge the greatly inaccurate value of 5.3µm for the coherence length be testament to the imprecision of the alignment intensity of the source and background noise and the irregularity of the stage movement apparatus use to fix the component relative to each other would result in a more precise alignment alternatively some mean of align component relative to angular scale on the optical breadboard would help alleviate this uncertainty a more intense source would act to reduce background noise in the interferogram provide the necessary step be take to ensure minimal background light escape the source into the experiment something we could ultimately not achieve a well quality stage or some other mean of adjust the path length such a implement the mach-zender design could decrease the observe noise in the interferograms,deep,the
134,2ndINT_CZD812_Redacted,fourier transform spectrometer in order to characterise 4 different light source the main aim of the experiment two white and blue lead and a white light tungsten source without and with a yellow bandpass filter a green laser be first use to find the null point of the apparatus so that the subsequent interferograms could be scan for their whole range about it for the aim of characterise different light source their light beam be sent into a fourier transform spectrometer and an interferogram be record about the null point see section i.ii this data be then process by an fft fast fourier transform algorithm in python to give the spectrum of each light source from which each source 's coherence length mean wavelength and spectral width can be calculate the spectral width be the fwhm full width half maximum of the spectrum graph related to the coherence length and mean wavelength by the follow formula 1 where δ hz be the spectral width of the source l m be the coherence length and c m -1 be the speed of light in a vacuum 2 where δ m be the spread of wavelength of the source see section i.iii the source be a white lead blue lead a white light tungsten source and the latter with a yellow bandpass filter 3 a an extension the temperature of the tungsten source be calculate by utilisation of wien 's displacement law see eqn 3 the root of interferometry date back to the 1800s towards the end of which michelson and morley conduct their famous `` fail `` experiment the aim of which be to measure the motion of the lab through the luminiferous ether their experiment be conduct by the use of a michelson interferometer where a light beam be sent to the input port half of the light be transmit while half of it be reflect through the beam splitter the separate light beam then travel perpendicularly to each other along the interferometer arm to two plane mirror normal to each beam where they get reflect and sent back to the beam splitter to recombine an interference pattern be observe at the output port the location of the fringe depends on the path difference and hence phase difference of the two beam 1 2 an application of the michelson interferometer be fourier transform spectrometry a michelson interferometer can be make into an ft by mount one of the mirror on a kinematic stage programmed by a computer to move at a constant velocity the signal measure at the output port of an ft be call the interferogram which be essentially the radiation intensity 1 when the path difference be equal to zero the recombine signal at the detector be in phase this point be call the null point which be indicate by the large amplitude of the interferogram 1 the far the mirror on the kinematic stage move from the null point the low the light intensity the `` coherence length be the distance the mirror can move before the interferogram contrast becomes poor `` 3 therefore in this experiment to characterise different light source scan be do about the null point to determine their coherence length mean wavelength and spectral width the latter of which `` be a measure of the range of frequency emit by a light source `` 3 the fast fourier transform fft be an algorithm to compute the dft discrete fourier transform of the interferogram initially the interferogram be in the spatial domain where the relative amplitude of the signal be plot against the position of the mirror the fft of this give the spectrum of the respective radiation source which be in the frequency domain where the wavelength be plot against the relative radiation intensity this be do in the case of this experiment by the python scipy library fftpack 4 for the interferogram of a monochromatic source in the ideal case in the frequency domain there would be one spike dirac delta function at the point of the wavelength emit by the source while for a polychromatic source there would be a number of dirac delta function however in practise the spike have a finite width lead to a spread of wavelength 3 this law describes the relationship between the absolute temperature of a blackbody and the peak wavelength radiation it emits it state that the product of the two quantity be constant where m be the mean wavelength emit by the source and t k be it absolute temperature this show a reciprocal relationship between the two a blackbody be an ideal absorber and emitter of radiation across all wavelength `` an lead be a pn junction whose emission wavelength depends on the band gap of the material use a blackbody radiates at a wavelength dependent only on the temperature of the body and nothing else `` 5 therefore wien 's displacement law be n't applicable to the white and blue lead and will hence only applies to the tungsten source a that u a tungsten filament which electricity be pas through so that it heat up and emits light a a result 6 the michelson interferometer be construct on an optical bench accord to the setup in fig 1. the mirror on the kinematic stage be manually move to the 0 of it coordinate system align so that it edge line up with the edge of the non-moving part the other mirror be place perpendicularly to it such that the path difference be a close to zero a possible measure use magnetic ruler so that the spectrometer would be set up about the null point more or less because the incident light beam of any source spread out more for longer distance the component of the interferometer be put close together also because the magnetic ruler provide be short the first light source use in order to align the interferometer and search for the null point be a green laser thorlabs at the output port a view screen be initially place instead of the detector in order to see the fringe by eye a combination of lens be use and their placement determine experimentally in order to view the best quality fringe 8 9 for perfectly perpendicular mirror haidinger fringe be observe while fizeau fringe be observe for mirror at an angle in order to search for the null point the haidinger fringe be use such that the centre would be at the detector once the haidinger fringe be obtain the view screen be replace with a detector place such that the centre of the haidinger fringe would be incident at the place of the detector input or a close to that arrangement a possible the detector gain be adjust by a knob such that the max relative intensity could be record but also not too high so that the detector would be saturate visually the null point be where the fringe be the large search for the null point take up an enormous portion of our laboratory time due to problem with alignment and also the speed at which the stage be be move the latter of which be identify quite late the speed at which the stage be move be along order of mm -1 to μms -1 which turn out to be quite important in actually record an interferogram for instance move it a fast a say 1 mm -1 be too fast to record and hence the output interferogram only look like noise with no pattern to it the default sample rate kept throughout the whole experiment be 50 hz the interferogram of the green laser be not what be expect of it ideally the green laser would be a monochromatic source so the interferogram should 've be a perfect continuous sinusoid however there be beating observe meaning that the green laser be actually make up of two or more discrete wavelength fig 2 despite not actually find the null point use the green laser my partner and i at first interpret wrongly that the point where the relative intensity be zero be the null point due to misunderstand the lab script 3 due to our ignorance we move on and begin try to find the null point of the white lead by move it about one of the laser `` null point `` it turn out that again the interferometer be n't align properly so it be plan to go back to the laser instead accidently after move around some of the spectrometer component it be align properly and be at the null point indicate by the white light fringe that be see on the view screen fig 3 that null point be found to be at position -0.297 a typed in the terminal program after the interferograms be plot use the matplotlib.pyplot library in python the tool in the graph output programme be use in order to determine the coherence length and mean wavelength after which the suitable formula see section i be implement in order to calculate the rest of the property see table i table i -properties of each light source determine from their a state in the introduction wien 's displacement law be only applicable to the tungsten source due to it resemble a blackbody and the yellow filter do n't change it temperature σl be the absolute uncertainty of the coherence length of each source the error be calculate use the formula see introduction and theory in conjunction with standard error calculation 10 the peak wavelength determine from the interferograms of each light source be a expect because accord to the electromagnetic spectrum the visible spectrum range from ∼3 nm to ∼ nm the midpoint of this range be 540 nm which be fairly close to the white lead wavelength the blue lead wavelength be expect to be shorter than this and so it be the white light tungsten source wavelength however be substantially longer than expect it felt hot to the touch so it be hypothesise that the wavelength would be closer to the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum but that clearly be n't the case on the other hand the temperature for the tungsten source accord to wien 's displacement law be relatively high than typical tungsten filament temperature in light bulb 11 suggest the wavelength should by even longer to get the right temperature which in turn suggests that either the hypothesis be incorrect or the tungsten source do n't resemble a blackbody enough so wien 's displacement law be n't applicable to it figure 10 show an interferogram different from the previous one instead of the envelope be a gaussian it be a sinc function instead which be the fourier transform of a rectangular function an effect interpret to have be provide by the bandpass filter 12 in agreement with an order of magnitude calculation the spectral width value be a predict on the order of ∼ 12 hz the uncertainty in the coherence length have be calculate from the random position error of the kinematic stage illustrate in fig 12 there be also a systematic error in the position which be later correct that be that the kinematic stage be always behind it suppose position in addition to the wobble the latter be the random error source the wobble be a a result of the faulty equipment and therefore could n't be fix during the experiment the uncertainty be found from max deviation from the suppose position and then double for the final coherence length uncertainty the subsequent error be calculate use equation 1 to 3 and standard error formula 10 to summarise the main aim of this experiment be to find out some of the property that characterise different light source in addition to construct a michelson and make it into an ft a well a far understand the application of the fourier transform to this topic the last of which i found to be fairly successful a i now have a much well idea of it conceptually most of the value gotten for the characterisation property be

135,2ndINT_GEI074_Redacted,in this experiment a michelson interferometer be construct and implement a a fourier transform spectrometer to characterize and investigate several different light source the spectrum of white light from an lead and tungsten source be generate a well a for a blue lead the interferometer could be use to characterize general feature of the the source such a the peak wavelength and spectral width however accurate numerical value be unable to be determine due to some unquantifiable uncertainty with the experimental set-up and procedure interferometry be a technique use to provide information on electromagnetic wave by analyze superposition phenomenon such a interference the michelson interferometer be invent by a.michelson in the late 19th century and use in the renowned michelson-morley experiment of 1887 which disprove the theory of the luminifeorus aether which be believe to be the medium for the propagation of light 1 the michelson interferometer induces interference by splitting a light beam into two part which travel along the two arm of the interferometer when they be recombine the path difference between the two component of the beam lead to interference effect which be use to provide information about the source the michelson interferometer be an extremely precise instrument a it be able to measure distance of the same order of magnitude a the wavelength of the light source in this experiment the michelson interferometer be assemble in such a way that it can be use a a spectrometer -a device that determines the constituent wavelength of light source when a michelson interferometer be use in such a way it be know a a fourier transform spectrometer the michelson interferometer set-up be show in figure 1. light from the source can travel along one of two orthogonal arm of the interferometer the first path label a be where light reflect by the beamsplitter travel to the movable mirror m1 the second path label b be the path of the transmit beam which travel to the fix mirror m2 when the two beam be reflect back to the beam-splitter they recombine and be direct towards the detector which pick up the interference pattern the interference pattern observe be dependent on the path difference the difference in path length along the arm be label t in the diagram so the overall path difference be 2t the dielectric plate cause a λ 2 phase change for one of the split beam of light which result in the production of a dark fringe due to destructive interference when there be no path difference 2 the null point be when the distance travel by the two beam be equal i.e t 0. when use the interferometer a a spectrometer collimate plane wave from the source be scan by the detector after produce an interference pattern due to the movement of the mirror m2 the series of bright and dark fringe produce around the null point be able to be record electronically by the detector it be possible by processing the interference pattern use a fast fourier transform fft to recover the original waveform of the source and obtain the spectrum show the constituent wavelength due to the nondispersive nature of air a monochromatic wave such a light from a laser will produce a continuous series of bright and dark fringe which appear a a delta function when an fft be perform on it monochromatic light have a high coherence length a it be make up of one wavelength of light 3 most light source consist of multiple wavelength of light meaning that the interference pattern be modulate furthermore white light consists of all wavelength in the visible spectrum so have a small coherence length practically this mean that only a few fringe of white light will be observe at the null point which be why it be important to accurately determine it location this be because only at the null point be the fringe pattern for each wavelength component in phase the spectral feature of light source can be approximate a gaussian meaning that the temporal feature be also gaussian therefore a gaussian can be fit to the interferograms obtain in order to approximate the coherence length the standard deviation of the gaussian σ be the coehrence length l. the relation between the frequency spectral width ∆ν and l be give by the spectral width have unit of frequency but this can be convert into a wavelength 4 the interferometer be construct consist of 2 mirror a beam-splitter detector and source one of the mirror be fix whilst the second one be mount on a stage which be control by a computer the detector be also plug into the computer to record data a schematic diagram of the experimental setup be show in figure 1. the two mirror be set up with roughly equal space a green laser be use to align the mirror such that haidinger fringe be observe on a screen place in front of the detector this only occur when the two mirror be exactly perpendicular to each other only the fix mirror could be adjust finely so this be adjust such that the two laser spot from the interferometer be directly on top of each other in order to find the null point the movable mirror on top of the stage have to be translate to the point where the separation from beam-splitter to both mirror be equal the movable mirror could be move through a position range of -12.5mm to 12.5mm and be initially maintain at the end of the stage 's range i.e -12.5mm the stage be then move in the positive translation direction 1mm at a time at a fast speed with the haidinger fringe observe manually on a screen place in front of the detector the fringe be observe to get big when it be close to the null point and small when far away the fix mirror be finely adjust after every 1mm increment to have the interference pattern center on the detector a best a could be do when the null point be pas the fringe change direction i.e they start appear out of the centre when they have be disappear into it this meant that the approximate location of the null point be identify such that the movable mirror could be scan through a small range of around 2mm rather than the full 25mm the photodetector be able to operate at 50hz use the detector and scan through the reduce range slowly at a speed of 0.002mms −1 the null point be able to be identify easily a a peak when a white lead source be use in place of the green laser subsequent data take use different source be center about this null point a blue lead and white tungsten source be use in addition to the white lead source an interferogram of the white lead source in the range of 0.02mm about the null point be take and a fast fourier transform fft of it be produce this be show in figure 2 and represent the range of wavelength of electromagnetic radiation present in the source there be two characteristic peak present in the spectrum one in the blue regime at approximately 455nm and the other in the yellow regime at 600nm this be due to the internal structure of the white lead -it be form of an individual blue lead with a phosphur coat that produce the yellow light through fluorescence it be expect that the amplitude of the first peak would be more than double the second from the datasheet of the lead however this be not observe here this be most likely due to the sensitivity to different wavelength of the detector use in the experiment -the spectral sensitivity of the detector be great at wavelength around the second yellow peak the white lead emits light encompass the whole range of the visible spectrum for comparison the interferogram of a blue lead source be also take and a fast fourier transform implement the spectrum obtain be show in figure 3. the peak wavelength be at around 470nm about 15mm large than the blue peak observe on the white lead spectrum this provide a rough insight into the uncertainty of the wavelength quote due to any misalignment and the set-up of the equipment the spectral width of the blue lead source could be calculate either from the fourier-transformed spectrum or directly from the interferogram after the interferogram have undergone a fourier-transform it be difficult to estimate how the uncertainty propagate so a gaussian be fit directly to the interferogram despite this the uncertainty on both the sensitivity of the detector and the actual position of the stage be difficult to ascertain so error on the whole be hard to obtain from the gaussian fit to the interferogram the standard deviation and associate uncertainty be able to be obtain and use a an estimate for the coherence length of the source the coherence length be then use to determine the spectral width of the source the spectral width of the blue lead source be calculate to be 30 ± 2 nm which be consistent with the spectrum in figure 3. the tungsten source could be consider a an approximate blackbody emit photon at a temperature give by wien 's law the fft be show in figure 4 and be a continuous spectrum the peak wavelength be take from the fourier transform and determine to be 830 ± 30 nm thus lead to a calculation of the temperature of the source 3490 ± 130 k. although figure 4 spectrum of a white tungsten source a a result of apply a fast fourier transform to the measure interferogram this be approximately a blackbody emission spectrum this blackbody approximation be make the interferogram be also fit with a gaussian curve to estimate the spectral width of the source from the fitting this be calculate to be 210±10nm a substantial fraction of the source be make up of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared region despite appear similar to the white lead source by eye the tungsten source be fundamentally different -consisting of a continuous spectrum of wavelength from the low end of the visible spectrum to infrared whilst the lead spectrum have two peak in the blue and green regime and do not emit radiation that be not visible to the human eye the difference can be explain by the efficiency of the source -there be more heat waste in the tungsten source in the infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum the white lead source be a more efficient source of light in the visible spectrum a a large fraction of the tungsten spectrum can not be see by the human eye from the datasheet of the tungsten source it be expect that the peak wavelength would be at 1200nm although this be not observe this be most likely due to the detector and it low sensitivity to wavelength of infrared light the specification manual for the detector indicates that sensitivity drop off rapidly for wavelength exceed 900nm 5 a yellow filter be place on the tungsten source a a mean of isolate frequency of visible yellow radiation the interferogram obtain be show in figure 5. the filter act a a sinc filter cut off frequency component above a certain cut-off frequency such a filter would have lead to a top-hat function after a fft a it be a rectangular low-pass filter in frequency space however this be not observe but could have arisen due to unfiltered light be reflect off the side of the container into the detector or from uncertainty in position of the stage have be move a michelson interferometer be adapt to be use a a fourier transform spectrometer capable of analyse different light source the interference pattern of a blue lead source white lead source and white tungsten source be record and use fast fourier transforms the original waveform be recover the spectrum give an insight to the wavelength component of the source and allow for the white lead and tungsten source to be contrast the lead source be compose of constituent wavelength throughout the visible range whilst the tungsten source involve the near-infrared spectrum in the white lead spectrum characteristic blue and yellow peak be observe at 455 ± 10 nm and 600 ± 10 nm respectively the peak wavelength of the tungsten source be determine to be 830 ± 30 the relative amplitude of the peak in the white lead spectrum and peak wavelength of the white tungsten source could not be reliably measure due to the spectral sensitivity of the detector use which be not constant however it could be conclude that the white lead be more efficient in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum a less energy be lose a infrared radiation if these uncertainty could be eliminate more accurate data could have be determine for the light source 6 bibliography,superficial,none
136,2ndINT_WFX625_Redacted,in this paper we investigate four different light source range from white to monochromatic and lead to incandescent lamp we predict and measure the spectrogram of these source and use fourier transforms to determine the wavelength that make up the various light source we calculate the mean wavelength and coherence length of the various source a well a the spectral width in frequency and wavelength space he interferometer be a powerful instrument use in many application in physic base on the simple principle of use mirror to produce interference pattern we can extract information from an everyday light source such a an lead or incandescent lamp use fourier transforms we be able to understand that light be n't simply one single wavelength be emit but rather a spectrum of wavelength all be emit to build up the colour we see with the naked eye use idea about the beating phenomenon that occurs with two similar frequency we be able to build up an idea a simulation on what we might expect from these different light source the interferometer allows u to make very small precise change and extract information by use the principle of interference by splitting a single beam of a light source into two individual beam we can reflect the beam and allow them to interact and interfere with each other the path difference between the two beam determine by the position of our two mirror will decide the interference pattern we observe if the distance the two beam travel be exactly the same then we expect to observe a constructive interference pattern any slight displacement of any of the two mirror will disrupt this pattern since we be deal with visible light the wavelength we be work with be on the order of 10 -7 m and a displacement of exactly λ/4 since the light have to travel to the mirror and back this be equivalent to a path difference of λ\2 where λ be the wavelength will result in destructive interference we can use a photodiode detector to observe and measure the interference pattern a we displace one of the mirror we also know that visually the constructive and destructive interference can be see by bright and dark fringe respectively the michelson interferometer show in fig 1 u a partially-silvered mirror know a a beamsplitter to split a beam from a light source into two the two beam carry on to their respective mirror and reflect back to the beamsplitter where they recombine and reflect towards the detector if the relative displacement between the two mirror t be equal to zero than normally we would observe perfect constructive interference however we introduce a dielectric plate on the beamsplitter to cause a phase change of π in one of the beam so we observe destructive interference instead when deal with monochromatic laser source we must consider the fact that the resultant light be actually a spectrum of multiple wavelength in frequency space we would expect a monochromatic wave to be a single delta function if we examine what happens with two delta function i.e light built up of two distinct frequency we begin to observe a beating pattern the intensity of the interferogram be modulate and the sequence of bright and dark fringe alternate between minimum and maximum amplitude it can be show that the degree of modulation depends on ν2 -ν1 the difference between the two frequency 1 the small this difference be the great the modulation a show in fig 2 in reality we deal with more than two distinct frequency first of all due to heisenberg 's uncertainty principle there will always be some uncertainty and variation in the energy of the photon release by the excite electron furthermore the thermal vibration of the electron cause a phenomenon know a thermal doppler broadening which contributes even more variation to the frequency we now opt to consider the frequency in the form of a gaussian distribution rather than a delta function in this case we can consider the spectral line width 2 of the gaussian to be similar to ν2 -ν1 i.e the small the width the longer the interferogram a show in fig 3 when simulate our interferograms we now have a well idea of what it will look like a monochromatic light will have a narrower distribution of frequency compare to white light in order to use the interferometer a a spectrometer i.e a device to measure the property of light we must be able to reliably and consistently produce interferograms in the area of maximum constructive interference the null point be the point at which the path difference between the two split light beam be exactly zero i.e t equal to zero and we will get a maximum intensity on our detector a we displace one of our mirror we must take several precaution when try to obtain the null point a it require careful alignment of the two mirror if we introduce any sort of relative angle of tilt between the two mirror we begin to observe the fringe a straight line know a fizeau fringe a show in fig 4 at value of t where the mirror do n't intersect the fringe start to curve a section of hyperbolae which would then result in inconsistency in the intensity measure by the detector 3 we must therefore take care in ensure the two mirror be parallel to produce collimate beam of light a well a circular fringe know a haidinger fringe this be important for our spectrogram a it allows u to produce consistent spectrogram with different light source without any unexpected variation in intensity it should be dependent solely on the path difference in order to determine the characteristic of the different light source we examine we measure the relative displacement of the mirror from the null point and the intensity of the light on the detector since the movement of the mirror and the detector act independently we must set both of them up to take reasonable data sample across the displacement range the detector be fix at 50hz i.e it can take 50 data sample every second the mirror mount on a moveable stage have a variable speed in mm/s which we can control therefore we need to make sure that number of data sample the detector take be enough to cover the entire range of displacement of the stage another precaution we must take be to make sure the stage do n't move too fast a the mechanical vibration cause by the movement can disturb the interference pattern to try and obtain a reasonable compromise between take enough data and minimize the time take for the measurement we opt to move the stage at speed on the order of 10 -7 m/s and around 10 3 data point once we have our data we can use fourier transforms to extract important information from our spectrogram this allows u to see more clearly the different wavelength that make up our light source and compare the gaussian in wavelength space of our light source and that of the simulation the spectral width be give by where δ𝜐 be the spectral width measure in hertz l be the coherence length the distance over which the spectrogram display coherence and c be the speed of light since we be fourier transform into wavelength space it be more helpful to consider the spectral width in term of wavelength we can use the equation where λ be the mean wavelength of the gaussian and δ𝜆 be the spectral width in term of wavelength to determine the coherence length of each light source we can consider full width half max fwhm of a gaussian fit to the spectrogram a show in fig 5 give by where σ be the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution the four light source we investigate and simulated be a white lead blue lead tungsten white lamp and the tungsten lamp with a green filter after we fit the gaussian to the spectrogram and determine the mean wavelength we can use 1 2 and 3 to determine the spectral width and compare them with our expect value from our simulation first of all we simulated the white lead by consider the average wavelength of the visible electromagnetic spectrum around 550nm and the spectral width equal to the range of the visible spectrum around 300nm this would suggest that all of the wavelength across the visible spectrum be emit simultaneously when in reality the white lead consists of mainly ultraviolet from the ingan material inside and yellow from phosphor wavelength the fourier transform a show in fig the blue lead be easy to simulate we can consider the average wavelength for blue light around 470nm and equate the spectral width to the range of blue light roughly 40nm in this case the blue lead consists of solely the blue wavelength lead to a relatively narrow spectral width and large coherence length a show in fig result for the four light source white and blue lead and the tungsten lamp with and without the green filter there be a clear pattern in spectral width with narrower spectral width be measure for monochromatic light source a predict the tungsten lamp emits light by heating a wire filament of tungsten to the point where it emits visible light since it relies on be heat up we expect the thermal doppler broadening to impact the spectral width more than with the lead furthermore our simulation for white light in fig 6 be a more accurate model of the tungsten lamp since it do emit a continuous spectrum rather than two distinct frequency the mean wavelength be also much closer to the average wavelength of the visible spectrum compare to the white lead a show in fig 8 since the green filter only allows green light through we can simulate green light use a wavelength of around 540nm and spectral width of about 40nm the result spectrogram produce a relatively long coherence length and narrow spectral width a show in fig 9 the mean wavelength be also much closer to our simulation a the green filter would not allow any other frequency of visible light through the green filter also introduces another effect the fourier transform in fig 9 show three peak all within the green range of wavelength which have be let through this result in a beating pattern which can be observe on the end of the spectrogram but which be not account for in the simulation the main source of error will be in the setup of the interferometer the michelson interferometer be a very powerful tool but also very sensitive and require a extremely high level of precision when be set up irregularity and slight lack of symmetry in the spectrogram reveals this error furthermore since the intensity of some of the light source we use be very low the signal start to become noisy and interference pattern become harder to obtain finally the fit for the spectrogram should not quite be consider to be gaussian the voigtian function be a convolution of the lorentzian and gaussian function and be more appropriate a it combine the idea of the thermal doppler broadening characterize by the gaussian function with the spectral line characterize by the lorentzian function 4 although the peak be the same the voigtian function account for the inaccuracy of the gaussian in the wing of the function a show in fig 5 improve the fit function will enable u to improve our estimate for the fwhm and therefore the spectral width of our light source we have be able to display a parallel between the theoretical simulation of light source and their respective spectrogram use a michelson interferometer use fourier transforms we have show that white light source whilst appear similar can be in fact construct from completely different wavelength and have drawn far parallel between the width of our gaussian simulation and what we 'd expect from the fourier transforms use the full width half max of a fit gaussian to our spectrogram we be able to establish a relationship between the coherence length of a light source and it spectral width there be still many improvement to be make both to the experimental procedure and the approach in analysis to far improve the match between simulation and experimental reality,deep,none
137,2ndINT_FYO506_Redacted,c haracterising the spectrum of a light source give insight into it property here a fourier transform spectrometer be built with a michelson interferometer and the spectrum of several different light source investigate the layout of the michelson interferometer be a show in fig 1 the difference in length t of each arm of the interferometer result in constructive and destructive interference visible at and around the detector the dielectric plate on the beamsplitter cause a phase change for one of the beam meaning destructive interference occurs at zero path difference 1 for light of wavelength λ when the mirror be properly align i.e perpendicular to the beam the m th fringe occur where − 1 2 π θ 1 2 π be the angle between the normal and the beam with a monochromatic light source project onto a flat screen this appear a a pattern of concentric circular fringe slowly move one of the mirror near the null point t 0 will output an interferogram the fourier transform of which will be the spectrum of the light source the interferometer be built a discus previously and the null point of the system be found first establish a rough range by eye use a laser which provide clearly visible fringe then to a great precision use a white lead colourful fringe be visible near the null point note this be do twice with slightly different setup in both case the precise null point be close to but slightly outside of the range expect once the null point be know interferograms of various light source be take over an appropriate range of movement the data take have be present in the figure to follow noteworthy point fig 3 show that the spectrum of the white lead use here be form of one narrow peak about 453 nm and a broader peak around 566 nm this be characteristic of a phosphor-based white lead with the narrow peak correspond to the light emit by the lead package itself and the broader peak correspond to the output of the phosphor from fig 8 and 10 it can be see that place the filter at different point in the system have yield different result in particular the filter be inside the filter holder of the light source cause unexpected behaviour the cause of this warrant far investigation from fig 11 it can be see that the yellow filter be imperfect block some wavelength that it should not this be problematic for the later investigation of the mercury discharge lamp fig 12 and 14 both show the output of the mercury discharge lamp increase in amplitude over time this can be explain by the temperature-pressure dependent nature of the mercury lamp a the temperature and pressure inside the lamp increase it output increase this be not properly account for in this investigation and in fact the lamp be frequently turn off and allow to cool due to concern about the ozone it generates fig 3. fourier transform of the white lead interferogram sharp peak centre around 453 nm 434 -480 nm violet -blue and a broader peak centre around 566 nm 480 -660 nm green -red white light be produce from lead in one of two way by a combination of different colour lead usually red green and blue or more commonly by combine a blue lead with shorter-wavelength emit phosphor 2 this spectrum suggests that this lead be the latter with a broad-emitting yellow-red phosphor be use in combination with a blue lead package 11 the filter be cause some wavelength to be block a such this be not useful to determine the characteristic of the lamp,superficial,the
138,2ndINT_BPP712_Redacted,michelson interferometer be use to investigate the transmission nature of thin-film bandpass-filters for this a green and a yellow filter be testis with a tungsten lamp both of them show several maximum in their transmissivity which verify the creation of a fabry-perot cavity in the filter additionally it be found that the maximum create by the green filter be space by integer multiple of 6.6 ± 0.7 nm i n 1899 the french physicist charles fabry and alfred perot developed an interferometer base on a transparent plate with two reflect surface 1 today the design be vastly use for optical fiber communication to separate multiple layer of the transmit signal it be also use for thin-film filter to create more exact reflective and pa band than absorption filter hence a michelson interferometer be use to determine the structure of two bandpass-filters interferograms for a tungsten lamp with and without the filter be create and compare to each other the detector be base on a silicone photo diode thus it measure light intensity with the photoelectric effect so that light energy have to excite electron in the diode for electromagnetic wave the magnetic and the electric part contribute equally to the energy carry by the wave ψ. thus it be enough to inspect only the electric field e to determine the intensity of the light for any electric wave the intensity be proportional to the square of the electric field strength 2 thus due to the geometry of the interferometer it may be approximate that the light propagates only in one direction x. thus ray emit from the light source can be assume to follow the equation where a be the amplitude k be the wavevector ω be angular frequency and φ be the phase shift at the beam splitter this be divide into two ray so that each be direct at one of the two mirror and thus reflect hence one of them have to travel far by twice the mirror separation distance at the beam splitter they be combine again and interfere with each other so that a new wave be create where for the first wave φ be set to be 0 and for the second it corresponds to the shift acquire when travel the additional distance 2d combine this with equation 1 condition for constructive and destructive interference can be found constructive interference occurs when n 0 2 4 ... and destructive when n 1 3 5 ... this can be then extend for an input of mixed wavelength so that for a give d a different interference can be measure with the detector a show in appendix a this lead to a physical fourier transform fig 1. crosssection of a thin-film bandpass filter 3 not to scale and the number of layer may vary the incident light ray be trap between the partially transmissive dielectric layer and thus a fabry-pierot cavity be create a a result destructive and constructive interference occurs so that wavelength far away form the central wavelength be not transmit to decrease the passband of the filter the substrate layer be cover in absorptive material with a broad block range thus the result shape may be described a periodic spike in a gaussian envelope at first a computer simulation be use to model the interferometer distinct light spectrum be model a gaussian distribution and layer onto each other this show that a large spike in light intensity be always to be see at the point where both interferometer arm have the same length null point d 0 the spectral range of the input be varied and it be found that a large spectral width lead to a narrower spike this corresponds to the principle of a fourier transform thus the null point could be most accurately found by inspect a white light source due to it broad spectrum base on this a michelson interferometer be built fig 1 the light source be place in a long tube to minimise light pollution and point at the beam splitter from there it be direct partially to the movable and partially to the stationary mirror 50 each thus a phase difference between the ray be induced since the distance travel by the ray would not be equal unless d 0 be reflect by the mirror the beam be again connect by the beam splitter the combine ray would then be measure by a detector with adjustable gain for white light source lead tungsten lamp a diffuser be place between the source and the beam splitter in order to achieve more uniform illumination to increase light intensity for weaker signal tungsten with filter a convex lens f 100 mm be place between the beam splitter and the detector the detector be position in the focal point the filter be place in the same area however they be mount onto a separate stand a see in fig 2 for easy implementation additionally the setup be place on rubber leg to minimise the effect of mechanical shock from the environment this be however not sufficient a external shock could be clearly record hence every measurement be take multiple time and inspect for random error firstly a laser be use to align the mirror the non movable mirror be adjust so that the two reflect ray would meet in one point at the detector then the interference pattern be inspect for haidinger fringe a they be form when the two ray be parallel 1 for large displacement the haidinger fringe would turn into fizeau fringe thus it be establish that the alignment of the movable mirror change with d. to minimise this effect on data quality a narrow range around the null point be inspect ±0.1 mm from null point moreover it be discover that if the mirror be move slow than 0.0003 mm s the distance between measurement be strongly distort by random error hence for all measurement the optimum velocity be establish to be 0.001 mm s a determine in the simulation a white lead be use to 4 therefore the null point should be marked by the global maximum of the obtain graph however the result graph for the lead be asymmetric this may be attribute to the lead 's not fully uniform light emission thus the null point be take to be the large visible spike and the related uncertainty be measure to be the distance to the next maximum from repeat measurement it be found that the movable mirror have to be place −1.7829 ± 0.00024 mm away from the center of the stage to be at the null point the obtain interferograms be then base on d with a discrete fourier transform a conversion to the wavelength domain be possible however for this the step size of the movable mirror be necessary fig 5 the motor be measure it position relative to the stage step size for 10000 measurement in a range of 0.2 mm at 0.001 mm s during each measurement of intensity by the detector the adjacent position value be then take and subtract from each other so that the step size between measurement be calculate this be then plot in a histogram and the result shape be approximately a cutoff gaussian with it peak at −20 nm and a standard deviation of 4.26 nm thus the step be assume to be approximately −20 nm so that a uniform discrete fourier transform could be apply this assumption be confirm with interferograms of white and blue lead fig 6 two lead white and blue be use to determine the accuracy of the setup since their spectrum be well-defined a show in fig 6 the spectrum seem to be smooth and correspond well to their know spectrum see appendix b however small oscillation be to be see away from the spectras peak these can be attribute to the background noise to capture the background noise an interferogram be create with no light source the result graph show a periodic triangular wave in superposition with a small wave of much large frequency fig 7 after a transformation to the wavelength domain no distinct spike in the visible spectrum can be see however several spike be locate around 17000 nm this be beyond the theoretical range of the detector appendix c thus it must have be add to the measurement after the light detection a possible source might be a charge and discharge capacitor in the vicinity of the photodiode or other electrical component the effect on data quality should be small a the spike be distant to the visible spectrum and can be thus easily filter a tungsten lamp be then use a the light source the result interferogram resembles the white lead a both source have a broad spectrum however the tungsten lamp be show few extremum around the null point thus it must have have a large spectrum this be confirm by the transformation to the wavelength domain fig 8 a continuous gauss-like graph can be see with a peak at ca 850 nm this could however be strongly influence by the detector 's relative spectral sesitivity appendix c due to the curve 's asymmetry the tungsten lamp seem to emit warmer light than the lead additionally the lamp 's temperature be increase during operation hence the infrared spectrum be verify above 700 nm then a green filter fl543.5-10 cw l 543.5 ± 2 nm f w hm 10 ± 2 nm be place in front of the detector this change the structure of the interferogram drastically fig 9 a new local extremum be induced to verify that this be a property of the filter the measurement be retaken three time all interferograms exhibit the same extremum the filter be then replace with a yellow filter fb580-10 cw l 580 ± 2 nm f w hm 10 ± 2 nm the obtain interferograms show similar extremum thus the observe phenomenon be a result of the filter structure moreover it be determine that for the green filter the maximum be space by integer multiple of 6.6 ± 0.7 nm a value could not be establish for the yellow filter the periodicity suggests a quantitative verification of a fabry-perot cavity in the green filter the shape of the yellow filter graph suggests also a qualitative verification however far calculation would be inconclusive due to the large uncertainty connect to the measurement a michelson interferometer be use to inspect the nature of two thin-film filter at first the setup be test for it quality and no problem be detect then the filter be inspect with a tungsten lamp a the light source both be show qualitative characteristic of a fabry-perot cavity a their interferograms be show clear destructive interference pattern however no meaningful calculation could be make due to large uncertainty an improvement of the setup should then allow for a more quantitative understand of the phenomenon for instance a motor with more uniform step or a non-uniform fourier transform would increase the data quality also the detector could take reading with a maximum frequency of 50 hz and thus limited the measurement density vastly additionally it relative spectral sensitivity be strong in the infrared spectrum a detector more sensitive to the visible spectrum would give clearer result fig 10. spectrum of a similar white lead a provide by the manufacturer 6 appendix c fig 11. relative spectral sensitivity a provide by the manufacturer for the detector sfh 2200 7 in case of n spectral line emit by the light source equation 3 can be extend to be i kj x−ωj t be i kj x−ωj t+kj 2d this have to be true for all time thus k j k j and ω j ω j base on this the light intensity see by the detector be this be a fourier series where the sinusoidal term go to 0. assume that the emit light be a spectrum instead of a series the equation would result in a fourier transform,prediction,the
139,2ndINT_LXZ649_Redacted,interferograms be take use a michelson interferometer use various source include an lead white light a blue lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury lamp fourier analysis be apply on the interferograms to yield the spectral characteristic of each source and these be compare and explain with the physic of each source t he goal of this experiment be to observe the spectral characteristic of various source and compare them use the physic involve in each source fourier transform spectroscopy be a less direct method of spectroscopy than for example use a monochromator or grate however can have a high signal to noise ratio than these simpler technique provide the main source of noise be not shot-noise this be know a felgett 's advantage 2 the first component of our fourier transform spectroscopy be the michelson interferometer be first use in 1887 for the famous michelson-morley experiment 1 which fail to detect luminiferous aether wind the second component be the fourier transform which be use to transition from path length space into wavelength space t he michelson inferometer consists of a ray from a light source travel to a beam splitter where it be sent to two different mirror at distance d 1 and d 2 from the beam splitter respectively the light reflect of each mirror and recombines before be receive by the photodetector a diagram be show in figure 1. crucially we can vary d 1 use a stepper motor by take the difference in length t |d 1 − d 2 we can determine the path difference between the two beam of light when they recombine a p t 2 this path difference cause the light to be at a different phase at the photodetector and so an interference pattern be generate different wavelength of light will interfere differently until the null point be reach where p t 0 and there be maximum constructive interference by vary p and take the output from the photodiode at each point we be able to produce an interferogram s ince a path difference be create between the two beam in an interferometer and light have a finite speed the path difference will translate into an effective temporal difference between the two beam this allows u to use a fourier transform to move between the time domain and the frequency domain for a specific wavenumber k 0 the intensity at the photodetector be give by where i k be the intensity of the source at the wavenumber k. apply the superposition principle the intensity detetected at the photodiode for all wavelength be give by where i k be the intensity distribution for the light source this be simply a cosine fourier transform therefore to retreive the intensity distribution we simply need to compute the inverse cosine fourier transform in practice we can take the real part of an inverse fourier transform a the signal be real t here be many different mechanism for light emission for a normal lead i.e the blue lead in our experiment electron travel over a band gap in a pn junction the potential difference on each side of the junction be different and this cause them to emit a photon of a specific wavelength to conserve energy in the white `` lead `` an lead be incident upon a fluorescent material this cause the photon emit by the lead to be absorbed by the material and re-emitted a a wide spectrum of different wavelength cause the light to appear white this be possible a the absorbed energy be first transfer away by vibration in the material before later be radiate away a a photon in a white tungsten lamp a filament be heat up and begin to emit many diffrent wavelength of light a a black body this mechanism consists of electron in the tungsten become excite to many different energy level and then transition down to many other level cause a wide array of different wavelength to be emit this spectrum of emission be give by planck 's law 6 where h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light k b be boltzmann 's constant and t be the temperature of the body the emission from a mercury gas discharge lamp be again cause by electron fall down energy level in a mercury atom a the mercury be a gas the atom be in thermal motion and so have momentum when a photon be release it energy may vary depend on the momentum of the atom this be know a doppler broadening and the derivation yield a gaussian emission profile 7 a. alignment f irst the component of the interferometer be attach to the optical table a show in figure 1. the next step be to align each component start at the beam splitter the light from the beam splitter be first make to be incident to the motorise mirror m2 centrally and perpendicularly to the surface of the mirror next the current distace between the beam splitter and m2 be measure when the motor be set to it middle location this distance be use to place m1 a very similar distance away in order to minimise time spent search for the null point and maximise the potential range the interferogram may be take over this mirror be also make to have light incident to it centrally and perpendicularly it be useful to check the beam splitter for the reflection to confirm this finally the photodetector be align such that the recombine beam be incident to it 's detector alignment be checked by make sure that the reflection from both mirror overlap each other completely the null point be the point at p 0 and may be found through a variety of different method the first be to simply move m2 through it 's full range and take a interferogram of white light to see when the intensity peak the second be to use a green laser and count the number of fringe observe at the photodetector this can be do by place a white surface in front of the photodetector the third method be to slowly move the mirror m2 at roughly 1µms −1 and observe whether the fringe appear to move `` out `` or `` in `` the fringe will start move in the other direction once the null point have be pas method 2 and 3 with a green laser be combine to perform a binary search until the region contain the null point be small enough to switch to white light and scan over the region the null point be found from the point on the interferogram with maximum interference after the null point be found collect data be quite trivial the source and filter may be varied and different interferograms take about the null point the mirror be make to start and finish at approximately the same distance to the null point it be important to note that the distance range of the interferogram be proportional to the resolution of the fourier transform and the resolution of the interferogram be proportional to the range of the fourier transform therefore in order to get good resolution large range be take and we also make sure to move the mirror slow enough to detect sufficiently small wavelength t he interferograms of the various source be show in the follow figure the position variable be position of the mirror and not from the null point although the null point be extremely close to the mirror 's 0 position these graph be sometimes hard to read a they contain many data point which blur together it can be see from these that the wider source of light have narrower coherence length the spectrum found by take the fourier transform of the interferograms be show in the follow figure the error on the fit be generate use an estimate covariance matrix not all spectrum have theoretical background for use a gaussian fit however it be convenient since it be simple and quantifies an approximation for the full-width-half-maximum the amplitude value on the graph be simply a 24 bit number output from the photodetector and have no unit the gaussian for the blue lead give a mean of 484.84 ± and standard deviation 13 ± 1 nm the white spectrum appear to contain two gaussians however we be unable to fit a second the mean wavelength here be 560 ± 1 nm and the standard deviation 76 ± 13 nm the standard deviation for this spectrum be much high than for the blue lead a expect the tungsten spectrum should theoretically be a black body spectrum and so fit use planck 's law however potentially due to the sensitivity of the photodiode to different wavelength the output appear very similar to a gaussian and so a gaussian be use this give a mean wavelength of 805.9±0.2 nm and standard deviation 119±7 nm notably the mean wavelength lie outside the visible range however the standard deviation be so great that the lamp appear white the fit for the green filter tungsten spectrum theoretically would be a convolution of the sensitivity of the photodiode with planck 's law however a gaussian again seem to be a good enough approximation the mean wavelength be 531.09±0.04 nm and the standard deviation 18±4 nm the green filter be able to filter all other wavelength exceptionally well and it be no surprise that this mean wavelength lie in the green part of the spectrum fig 12. a spectrum of a tungsten lamp with a yellow filter the spectrum be again narrower but can be see to be shift to the right slightly again use a gaussian for the yellow filter tungsten spectrum we find a mean of 569.8 ± 0.4 nm lie in the yellow part of visible light the standard deviation be found to be 24 ± 4 nm this mercury spectrum show the two region we be interested in the green peak and the yellow doublet we use filter to focus on the two area separately a gaussian fit to the green filter mercury show a mean wavelength of 547.4 ± 0.2 nm and a standard deviation of 30±4 nm this agrees quite close with the accepted value of the emission at 546.1nm 8 the 0.24 discrepancy between our value and the accepted value be potentially due to the variable sensitivity of the photodiode and with far analysis this could be account for we be unable to fit to the doublet spectrum however just reading from the graph it be possible to see that the mean wavelength be about 573nm and 620nm this difficulty in fitting may have be cause by take an interferogram over too long a range and so increase the number of noise data point we be able to use a hilbert transform to plot and fit to the envelope of the blue lead and mercury lamp interferograms the standard deviation of these gaussians agree with the spectrum assume that they be the fourier transforms of the spectrum gaussians a expect v. conclusion t he goal of this experiment be to record interferograms characterise spectrum from various source this be do quite effectively with the measure value for the mercury green line found to be 546.4 ± 0.2 nm which agrees with the nist accepted value well than 0.24 to improve this experiment interferograms could be take to reduce the amount of data in some of the fourier transforms and the effect of the photodiode sensitivity curve account for,superficial,bal
140,2ndINT_PAO564_Redacted,michelson interferometer can be use to observe interferograms that be produce by different light source a fourier transform of these interferograms can be use to see the spread of wavelength emit by a light source this mean we can observe the intensity of light emit across different wavelength of light emit diode and black body radiator blue lead be observe to have a wavelength of 465±10nm white lead be observe to have a wavelength of 595±50nm a tungsten light source with a yellow filter have a wavelength of 585±18nm and a green filter result in a wavelength of 546±13nm due to the detector be unable to measure in the infrared it be impossible to observe the full black body spectrum of the tungsten light source without filter but the peak wavelength be found to be 856 ±59nm when wave with different phase meet interference between the wave occurs and base on the phase of the individual wave constructive or destructive interference can occur for wave of the same wavelength constructive interference occurs when the path difference between the two wave be a multiple of the wavelength destructive interference occurs when the path difference be an odd multiple of half wavelength we investigate how different light source interfere in a michelson interferometer to produce fringe and how these fringe can help u determine the wavelength of light that the source emits at we use blue and white lead a well a a tungsten lamp with and without filter to observe how the filter light varies from the unfiltered light a michelson interferometer will be set up for this experiment a michelson interferometer consists of a light source point at a beam splitter that separate the light into two perpendicular beam that travel to a mirror and be reflect to the beam splitter where they recombine this recombine light be then sent towards a photodetector which can be use to detect phase change base on the intensity of the signal if the mirror be space the same distance apart then the light travel the same distance both way and should recombine with a phase difference of zero result in constructive interference but the dielectric plate on the beam splitter change the phase of one of the wave result in destructive interference when the distance between the mirror be the same the mirror surface on the end of the interferometer be place perpendicular to the beam of light ensures that haidinger fringe will be present tilt mirror will result in fizeau fringe haidinger fringe occur because the perpendicular mirror create ray of light that travel parallel to each other and appear to come from a source infinitely far away when the mirror be not perpendicular the light recombines and creates fringe that appear to be from a point source close to the mirror for this experiment haidinger fringe be prefer a they will enable u to find the 'null point where the path difference between the two wave be zero a we approach the null point we will begin to observe large change in the photodetector signal this be cause by the fringe and the width of the fringe will depend on the light source light source can be model to be approximately gaussian and this will result in each of the light source have a spectral line base on the light they emit a light source with a narrow spectral line monochromatic light will result in a wider fringe and a wider spectral line such a from a white light source will result in a narrower fringe we can obtain the fringe for each of the light source by move one of the mirror through the null point and then we can convert the fringe back into a gaussian line shape to investigate the light source and the wavelength of light that it emits at once the experimental fringe be obtain we can use fourier transform on them to convert them to show the spectral line and from this we can investigate the wavelength that the light source emit at we use two different type of light source to investigate the fringe pattern create around the null point blue and white lead along be use along with a tungsten lamp and yellow and green filter lead consist of a crystalline material with electron be able to transition between the two layer 2 this transition result in the electron lose energy and a photon with equivalent energy be release two different semiconductor material can be combine to release photon at different wavelength 2 the tungsten lamp consists of a metal be heat and the electron in the metal release energy a they de-excite after be excite due to heating this mean that there be no restriction in the exact wavelength of photon that can be release like with lead so the tungsten lamp will emit like a black-body across all wavelenghts due to it black-body emission we can link temperature to the high internsity wavelength emit through wien 's lawequation 1 investigate property of light source base on interferograms ■ an optical table be require for the whole interferometer to rest on a this greatly reduces the noise that might affect result by reduce the amplitude of any oscillation such a from the shake of the table a stage with a movable rnittor and a fix mirrnr with tilt adjustment will be place at the end of the interferometer and they will be place approximately the same distance apart the whole setup of equipment can be see in figure 1. when the light source be connect to the beam splitter there be a diverge lens place between the beam splitter and the source this spread out the light and a converge lens be place after the beam be recombine to focus it onto the detector after the rnittors be place approximately the same distance apart we attempt to find the null point we use a green laser to view the fringe and align the stationary rnittor to be a close to perpendicular a possible to ensure that we could see haidinger fringe after the alignment we move the stage at a slow pace and note when the fringe be move inwards we then move the stage to a different position and move it towards the previous position if the fringe move inwards in both case that meant the null point be between the two position we then move the stage in between the two initial position and repeat this until both fringe move inwards and the null point be within 0.1mm we the switch to white light to find the exact null point this be because the wider range of wavelength mean that there be a much small fringe and so the null point can be found with high accuracy after obtain the interferograms we use fourier transforms to show the spread of wavelength of the light source single colour light source interferograms span the long across the null point and this be to be expect due to their nan-ow wavelength band the blue lead wavelength spread can be see in figure 2 the blue lead have a very sharp increase in wavelength and have a peak wavelength of 465±10nm the gaussian that be overlaid follow the general shape but it can not be use a good approxirnation for it because lead light ernission be dependent on specific frequency base on the energy release by the photon `` -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- figure 3 the fourier transform for the interferogram collect for the white lead over the null point two gaussians have be fit for each of the peak the first peak be at 465nm and the second gaussian peak be at 605nm figure 3 show the spread of wavelength for the white lead white light consists of all frequency of visible light and so it have a much large spread of wavelength than the blue lead and this be to be expect a single gaussian can not be fit to this fourier transform due to the shape but the mea wavelength could be calculate through the interferogram and be found to be 595±50nm lead be make from semiconductor material which can only ernit at certain frequency so emit white light mean that different semiconductor material be join together and the two peak show the wavelength that each of the semiconductor material emits at the lead ernits blue light at a. peak of 465nm and yellow light a.t 605nm there could be other material emit different light but that can only be conclude if a high resolution interferogram be take it it unlikely that a single material can emit the large range of wavelength show by the second gaussian when filter the light emit by the tungsten light source we see a clear spread of wavelength but there be also a dip that be see in between the spread of wavelength in figure 4. the gaussian do not properly fit the shape of the peak that be see two separate gaussians could be fit but this should not be require a tungsten can be model a a black body and so all wavelength should be present this phenomenon be also present in figure 5 when the filter be change for a green filter the gaussian fit for the green filter be also not suitable a the shape should approximate to a square wave for a certain wavelength range the filter should function to let in a range of wavelength and so all other wavelength should not be allow to pa through we use different filter of the same colour but the sharp drop in intensity remain across all test figure 5 the fourier transform for the tungsten light source with a green filter the peak wavelength be approximate through the gaussian and be determine to be 546±13nm figure 6 the fourier transform for the tungsten light souce with no filter present the peak wavelength be approximate through the gaussian and be determine to be 855±nm when all filter be remove from the tungsten source we obtain a wavelength spread that be much large and peak near the infrared part of the spectrum at 855nm the gaussian that we fit to the curve be n't a good fit even though tungsten emits like a black body this be because the tungsten source should emit light in the range of 360-2600nm a state by the manufacturer the manufacturer also state that the peak wavelength should be 1000nm 1 which be 17 away from the detect wavelength even if we account for the 15k error in the temperature value of 2796k 1 the peak wavelength of 855nm be not within this error this mean that the detector be miss a very large part of the spectrum from the tungsten source the detector likely can not collect data in the infrared region so this mean that our data be incomplete which be why the gaussian be not a good fit by use the peak wavelength we can use equation 1 to calculate the temperature that the tungsten be at use 855nm result in a temperature of 3390k which be 21 off the actual value of 2796k that be state on the light source a michelson interferometer be a valuable tool that can help u analyse different light source and enable u to observe how their spectrum change base on the method they use to produce photon lead emit small photon in a narrow wavelength band and be not suitably described by a gaussian curve black body emitter such a tungsten emit over large wavelength band and they be more suitable to be described by a gaussian,superficial,none
141,2ndINT_MOX979_Redacted,in this report the ability of a `` motor-powered `` version of the `` michelson interferometer `` to map the spectrum of a variety of light source be test the light source use have a variety of spectrum namely gaussian lorentzian and black-body it be found that the interferometer could charactarise these source with a resolution on the scale of ∼ 5 − 100nm the range of wavelength the set-up could map be found to be from 400nm − 1000nm the interferometer be also able to differentiate between distribution in a superposition limit on the technique be also found chief be the ability to isolate the set-up from outside light and heat several suggestion on how to improve the set-up be also make i nterferometry be a technique use to probe matter use light the technique be first use by michelson and morley in their attempt to detect the aether the technique have be use to study phenomenon from the atomic scale to the stellar scale most recently it be use by the `` laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory `` in the first ever detection of gravitational wave there be many type of interferometer such a the fizeau michelson and fabry-perot interferometer however they be all base on the principle of superposition and the fact that the way two wave behave in superposition be indicative of some property of the wave in this report the ability of the michelson interferometer to characterise light source be test this be do by take interferograms use fourier analysis the limit of the method for mapping spectrum a well a method for reduce error be discus a well a this some characteristic of the light source be infer from the spectrum if the technique of interferometry be improve significantly over the next few year it could be possible to use the technique to find the chemical composition of `` exoplanets `` by mapping the absorption spectrum of light passing through the atmosphere of say planet this could lead to the first sign of organic life outwith the earth the basic michelson interferometer be show in fig 1. interference occurs when two light wave superimpose on top of each other for monochromatic light constructive interference occurs at phase shift of 2nπ and destructive interference occurs at phase shift of 2n − 1 π. this can be achieve with the interferometer by vary the value of t by integer and half-integer value of the wavelength of the light this produce an interference pattern when the mirror be move consist of peak at different value of t. in reality there be no such thing a a monochromatic source of light a the momentum of light be give by it wavelength a perfect monochromatic source with no uncertainty in wavelength would produce light with perfectly know momentum this be impossible a it violates the heisenberg uncertainty principle many light source therefore be give by a spectrum of wavelength which can be approximate by a gaussian curve this do not have a huge effect in the distance between peak but instead creates an envelope for the amplitude of the wave depend on the value of t. when t be close to zero the amplitude remains unchanged however a t increase the amplitude drop a the different wavelength across the gaussian interfere with each other the interferogram 's amplitude with t have an envelope that be related to the fourier transform of the wavelength spectrum of the light be measure this make the interferogram a fourier transform spectrometer assume that light be a gaussian the interferogram envelope can be found by look at the fourier transform which be another gaussian with a width reciprocal to the original width this mean that a wide spectrum should lead to a very narrow interferogram and vice versa to show this a simulation of the interferogram produce by several gaussians be provide by the experiment lead the interferograms of a wide spectrum and a narrow spectrum be show in fig 2. the wavelength and spread can be determine use the interferogram the mean wavelength be determine by aver- age the value of the distance between the small sinusoidal peak in the interferogram this value be then divide by two a the motor move forward by some amount cause a change of two time that amount to the path difference the spread can be determine by take spread of the interferogram and relate it to the spread in wavelength use where λ and ∆λ be the mean wavelength and spread in wavelength respectively and l be the coherence length which be related to the full width at half maximum of the interferogram 1 with the interferogram it be also possible to recover the spectrum use a fourier transform these calculation be possible due to the fact that t and 1/λ be fourier conjugate 1 to test the set-up several light source be use blue and white lead tungsten filament and the green line from a mercury lamp each light source have a distinct spectrum due to the mechanism that produce the light tungsten produce a black-body spectrum from the kinetic energy of electron in the metallic lattice which produce the light the lead should produce lorentzian distribution with the white lead also produce a second wider gaussian due to a phosphorescent component the mercury lamp produce light a electron jump energy level this lead to a narrow peak that follow a lorentzian the lorentzian be give by where i be the intensity a be the amplitude w be the width and x 0 be the average value of x which for fig 1 be the value of t. these different light source lead to wavelength distribution show in fig 3. the michelson interefrometer be set-up in accordance with fig 1. a picture be show in fig 4. with the arm be of approximately equal length before any data could be take the null point be determine the null point be the exact distance of the motor such data be take for the different source exclude the green mercury line interferograms be produce and analyse the average wavelength and spread of wavelength for the light source be show in table i. it can be see that the white lead cover the visible spectrum ∼ 400nm − 700nm with the average be ap-proximately central this be expect of a white lead in order a for it to appear white require wavelength from across the visible spectrum the blue lead have a much narrower spread suggest that it indeed produce monochromatic light the tungsten filament produce light which peak in just within the infrared however the spread be large enough that significant light be produce throughout the visible spectrum this corresponds to an orange-yellow glow the temperature of the filament can be estimate use wien 's displacement law do this give a temperature of 3625k the analysis of the interferograms produce good data for light source and be a valid proof of method however to gain far insight into the mechanism the spectrum could be investigate this be do by use the fast fourier transform fft algorithm to test the effectiveness of the algorithm the interferogram of the green line of sodium be take a green filter be use to isolate the line the fft should produce a lorentzian of when run the spectrum in fig 5 be produce it can be see that the spectrum do roughly follow a lorentzian fit the deviation could be due to either uncertainty in the interferometer set-up/fourier transform or it could be due to broadening of the spectrum in the lamp due to doppler effect the lorentzian be centre at 546nm this corresponds with an accepted mercury line at that wavelength 2 which give proof of method for the technique a the transform match well with the data assume that the peak in the spectrum be small than that of the interferogram this give the interferometer a bad case resolution of ∼ 100nm a the technique be successful for the green mercury lamp the fourier transform be take on the data for the light source in table i. these be show in fig 6 7 and 8. it can be see from fig 6 that the blue lead seem to also follow a more lorentzian curve there be some slight asymmetry in the curve this could be due to the fact that the broadening of the line in the lead be asymmetrical or that the interferogram do n't cover a large enough range of t for small wavelength to appear in the fourier transform a show in fig 7 the white lead have a more complex spectrum it be compose of a lorentzian peak at ∼ 450nm and a gaussian peak at ∼ 600nm these correspond to the light emit by the blue lead and the phosphor respectively it can be see that the method successfully capture the property of two different light source superimpose this give an indication that the technique could be able to map more complex spectrum for example the entire spectrum of element could be mapped use this technique it can be see from fig 8 that the curve do not fit the black body spectrum associate with a peak wavelength of 800nm this would suggest either the tungsten do not follow a black-body or more likely that there be some error in the detector the left side seem to follow quite closely the black-body in orange but with a rightward shift until at around 700 − 800nm the curve deviate and drop back to zero this suggests that the high wavelength infrared radiation be too low energy to be detect by the sensor and therefore do appear this would suggest that the actual peak be far into the infrared region and that the actual temperature of the filament have a low temperature than 3000k in conclusion the michelson interefrometer be able to charactarise different light source with good accuracy it be able to identify lorentzian gaussian and black-body spectraincluding when these distribution be superimpose it could also determine the mean wavelength and spread correctly within the visible spectrum the resolution be determine by the green line of mercury to be around 100nm however the plot of the blue lead in fig 6 would suggest that the uncertainty in fig 5 be due to the instability of the light source or interference cause by the filter if this be the case the resolution could be a little a 5nm to fully test the resolution a long interferogram of an extremely stable and narrow light source would need to be take the main shortcoming of the set-up seem to be that the detector be only capable of detect light within the visible spectrum attempt to fix this do present a problem the detector should produce the same response regardless of the wavelength of light use but small wavelength light have more energy and therefore will be more likely to produce a large response all object be constantly emit infrared wave at room temperature and so experiment would have to be cool down if infrared wave be go to be study so it also becomes harder and harder to isolate the interferometer a the detector becomes more sensitive to high wavelength light another problem exists for low wavelength wave from 1 a the mean wavelength decrease the coherence length also decrease until the envelope be too small to be distinguish from noise in the interferogram for these reason the michelson interferometer use be best suit for a range of wavelength from ultraviolet light to just within the infrared range this could be use to map spectrum of element and/or compound for example if other wavelength range be go to be use the interferometer will have to be adjust to suit say range future work to improve the interferometer set-up could include well isolation of the interferometer to allow for light of much low intensity to be detect an idea for isolate and cool the interferometer could be place one in space a this would isolate many man-made source of wave,superficial,the
142,2ndINT_GQV977_Redacted,the interferometer have be a vital tool in several scientific field since it development in the 19 th century by albert a. michelson 1 it u include find very small distance for example to find imperfection in a mirror and large one such a the diameter of distant star in term of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation use in the interferometer 2 this experiment will study the interferograms of light source of different kindsincluding those that emit black body radiation a oppose to individual wavelength due to emission line that come about from quantisationand use discrete fourier analysis to study the characteristic of the source use their interferograms e begin the experiment by set up and align the equipment in the interferometer such that one of the mirror could be move linearly by a distance 't in order to increase or decrease the path difference of two ray and therefore alter the pattern of light output by the spectrometer a schematic diagram of the michelson interferometer be a follow the mirror that can be move linearly be m1 and it distance from the beam splitter at any point in time can be found by the fix distance of m2 from the beam splitter add to the value 't which can be control via a terminal on a computer connect to a move stage we take a range of intensity reading from the detector take continuously a the stage be move by a motor these be use to produce a plot of intensity versus position which can be fourier transform by a numerical 'fft fast fourier transform into frequency space that would then produce a unique spectrum for every light source study the first step be to find the null point where t=0 i deduce mathematically that with decrease distance from the null point the haidinger fringe project on a screen would appear to move inwards we therefore advanced towards this point until the thickness of the ring decrease this enable u to eventually find the null point which lay at a stage distance of 1.014mm 4 figure 2 haidinger fringe on a screen http //www.google.co.uk/url sa=i source=imgres cd= cad=rja uact=8 ved=2ahukewip-mjlkfreahwoikykhe8yaomqjrx6bagbeau url=https 3a 2f 2f

we analyse in order to obtain four different interferograms the light source we will compare be this be an improvement on an earlier reading before we add ground glass and paper with a small aperture which look like this due to the lead 's physical structure the white tungsten filament 's interferogram a expect be very narrow because of the very wide spectrum of wavelength emit these can be described by black body radiation rather than simply emission line such a for a monochromatic lead more on this later tungsten filament can provide a broader spectrum of lightsee the coherence length comparison in the next section this method be clearly not reliable a found by these result a well a others we instead use an alternative method which defines the coherence length to be directly related to the full width at half maximum fwhm of the curve assume they be gaussian l be the standard deviation which can be show to be we therefore directly analyse our result on the computer screen to find value for the fwhm for each light source 's interferogram and take 3 repeat reading to reduce the uncertainty a follow value of fwhm µm mean/µm white lead 1. this table demonstrates that the tungsten lamp have the broad range of wavelength these be all within the visible spectrum and therefore help it to appear more 'white i.e it be more of a mix of all colour compare to the white lead the opposite argument applies for the tungsten with a yellow filter which have the narrow range of wavelength before move onto the fourier transforms of the source interferograms we can first use a result derive from fourier analysis which give a more numerical comparison of the different source range of frequency also know a the spectral width far analysis can be do once the wavelength be found from the fourier transform graph and again assume the peak to be approximately gaussian the spread of wavelength can be found a follow 3 python code be design to use the output from the detector and use these value to directly form a fourier transform not only to plot the graph of actual result the interferograms we will first analyse the transforms from the lead the white lead 's wavelength spectrum suggests a large wide peak around the red/green area and another very small bump around the blue one could think that the small peak be simply an artefact that come into existence because of the bump on the left-hand side of the interferogram but this would be wrong for one important reason white lead be expect to give this type of emission here be another typical white lead spectrum for comparison the light emit from lead be cause by phospholuminescence where an electric field cause a semiconductor to emit light 5 lead of each colour such a our blue one emit light within a very narrow spectrum due to radiative recombination explain far later in this section essentially this describes electron 'falling into hole in the valence band of a semiconductor a semiconductor due to quantisation have two separate 'bands where electron can lie the valence band and the conduction band separate by a band gap across which electron must jump in a metal there be no band gap 6 the energy of this jump give the emit photon their frequency accord to e= ℏω this phenomenon alone explains the narrow peak for the blue lead but do not explain the wide curve in the red-green region for the white lead an explanation for this be that the lead itself emits one frequency of blue light visible on the graph a well a high frequency with an even shorter wavelength and a high energy this blue light or uv however do not escape the case of the lead the case contains a phosphor which absorbs the energy of these wavelength and then emits this energy a photon with a much broader range of frequency 7 this luminescence phenomenon be know a phosphorescence 8 and can be see clearly on the white lead 's spectrum here be the wavelength spectrum of the tungsten source the pure tungsten lamp have a very broad range of wavelength range between around 500-1200nm which we will not be able to simply describe by mean of the photon emit when an electron drop from one quantise energy level to another instead an explanation for this be two successive phenomenacollision ionisation and radiative recombination -which give rise to a hot tungsten lamp 's behaviour a a black body emitter the former be cause by the movement of delocalize electron within the lattice of tungsten cation in the lamp the electron can be involve in collision with outer-shell electron and displace them which mean that the energy of ionisation be overall lose from the system and a hole be left in the ion that be now miss the electron the same collision equally apply to inner shell electron leave hole at different energy level to be fill 9 that be collision ionisation we must now look to the 'positively charge hole left by this phenomenon and how they be fill consider the sea of delocalised electron in the lamp and assume that they be in thermal equilibrium with the rest of the metal we could then describe the energy of these electron with a boltzmann distribution with a continuous spectrum of energy where most electron have a kinetic energy above the mean i.e there be a positive skew now through the process of radiative recombination any give electron can now fill a hole in any energy level of the tungsten cation to return them to their original charge this electron be now localise and have lose all it kinetic energy which a we have discus can take a continuous spectrum of value in the process of replace the lose electron the new electron will emit all it kinetic energy a a photon with it frequency obey the equation e=ℏω therefore a continuous spectrum of frequency be emit and so we see a continuous black body spectrum of wavelength 10 far analysis can be do on this black body spectrum we can first take some reading from the spectrum in figure 15 left to determine the most likely wavelength emit from the source from the fourier transform we have found that the wavelength be 2×426nm which be 852nm from this value we can use wien 's displacement law which link the peak wavelength to temperature in k. wien 's displacement constant b have empirically be show to be 2.90×10 -3 mk 11 this set the temperature of the tungsten lamp at 3.40×10 3 k 12 which we have deduce simply from fourier analysis on the lamp 's interferogram and assume it wavelength spectrum to behave exactly like that of a black body emitter add the yellow filter mean that the wavelength spectrum be immediately far narrower the peak for this spectrum ignore that the fluctuation do not affect the actual position of the peak on the graph which they do lie at approximately 2.87×2 which corresponds to a wavelength of 573nm a expect for yellow light which take an approximate range of 560-590nm 13 to explain the fluctuation around the peak we must consider the interferogram for the yellow-filtered tungsten lamp there be a beating pattern to the left and right of the main peak of the yellow light which then add the variation we see in figure 16 which affect the shape of the wavelength peakthe algorithm have picked up these unwanted frequency the fourier transforms for the interferograms for all 4 source confirm the earlier calculation which state that the unfiltered tungsten lamp have the broad range of wavelength and so it radiation bear closer resemblance to daylight compare to the white lead 14 they also confirm that the yellow-filtered tungsten light have a narrower range of wavelength than the blue lead which can now be see by directly compare the width of the two peak of the wavelength spectrum in figure 13 and 16. the interferometer succeed in find relatively accurate interferograms of the different source which could then be characterize by use of a fourier transform to provide a wavelength spectrum these spectrum provide an insight into the type of wavelength one would expect to find from different source and with different filter a well a the range cover by such emission spectrum the experiment be mostly qualitative in that it show the characteristic of each type of radiation such a show that the blue or yellow monochromatic source emit narrow line of radiation whereas black body radiation would be a more fitting model for other source such a the incandescent filament lamp there be some quantitative aspect such a find the wavelength of the source and most find the most likely wavelength from the tungsten lamp which be subsequently use to quantitatively deduce it temperature in analyse the error propagate throughout the process of find the temperature i found that the large source of error include deduce the most likely wavelength use the three repeat reading to obtain this the value be around 425.7±0.9 nm give a percentage error of 0.2 which be very small the other main error would be that of the spectrometer of the order ±0.5 15 and that of apply wien 's displacement law which be minimalized because the constant b be give accurately to 8 significant figure in the calculation we could round this percentage error to 1 and therefore say that the temperature of the tungsten lamp at thermal equilibrium reach 3.400±0.003 ×10 3 k which fit with the statement that they reach temperature of 'about 3000k drawn from 5 other scientific source 16 another small improvement to be make could be that when fourier transform the yellow-filtered tungsten 's interferogram the range could have be cropped so that the beating pattern on either side be not include and so would not produce unwanted fluctuation around the peak of the wavelength spectrum more effort could have be make in rearrange the white lead to minimize far the effect of it structure on the shape of it interferogram one final improvement would have be to alter the code early on to account for the fact that the 'wavelength plot only show half of the wavelength because of any distance move by the mirror would cause twice that difference in path length 14 tungsten imitates daylight 's visible range http //www.google.co.uk/url sa=i

143,2ndINT_TAP080_Redacted,in this investigation the characteristic of two lead and a tungsten optical fibre be investigate an interferometer be construct and use a a spectrometer by obtain the interferograms for each source around the null point the spectral wavelength width ∆λ for each source lead band gap egap and the temperature of the tungsten fibre be measure ∆λ for the white lead be obtain to be 13.8 ± 0.7 nm while that for the blue lead be obtain to be 9.51 ± 0.23 nm and that for the tungsten source be found to be 121 ± 26 nm egap for the white lead be found to be 2.43 ± 0.05 ev and that for the blue lead be 2.56 ± 0.04 ev the temperature of the tungsten source be determine to be 3450 ± 520 k. i nterferometry be a widely use technique to investigate the property of electromagnetic wave emit by a source it be base on the principle of superposition of wave such that information can be extract from the interference produce a a result of a phase difference between two wave beam with application in particle physic astronomy spectroscopy and several other field of physic interferometry be one of the most important technique where precision of measurement be require in this experiment we use interferometry for the purpose of spectroscopy -to investigate the property of the emission spectrum of white and blue lead and a tungsten optical fiber while infer the detail of the internal structure of these source an interferometer be construct and use a a spectrometer the path difference between the split beam be varied and the interference observe be analyze to obtain the wavelength spectrum contain in the incident light the spectral width of the source the band gap of the lead and the temperature of the tungsten source be determine interference be cause by the superposition of two or more wave have travel different distance and thus have a path difference lead to a phase difference this lead to a distinct fringe pattern of constructively interfere maximum and destructuvely interfere minimum the process be see clearer in fig 1 where a wave be reflect off of two mirror one of which be partially reflective for a surface space of t it can be show from the geometry of the figure that where λ be the wavelength of light m be the order of the maximum and θ be the angle at which the mth order maximum be observe the interferometer that we assemble consists of a mirror sit on top of a moveable stage the null point be define a the position of the stage at which the central maximum of interference be observe the light emit by a source be compose of several wavelength in a give spectral width of a gaussian this cause the interference produce to be a sum of the interference between all the wavelength present a white light source can be imagine a have a spectral width over the whole visible range the interferogram signal record due to interference be a fourier transform of the spectrum a wide spectrum be need to produce a narrow interferogram therefore a white lead be use to locate the exact position of the central maximum of interference -the null point we expect to see an interferogram similar to the one see in fig 2. the fourier transform f k of a function f x be give by the function f x can be retrieve through an inverse fourier transform of f k by the fourier transform of an interferogram signal record give the constituent frequency and thus wavelength that make up the signal these transforms be implement through the fft python scipy package to extract the signal spectrum the coherence length l of a source be define a the distance over which the phase of a wave measure at different point remains constant to a specify degree and be give by where c be the speed of light and ∆ν be the spectral widththe emit by a source l be determine by fitting a gaussian to the envelope of the interferogram and measure it standard deviation the width in wavelength can be found by where λ be the mean wavelength of the source which be found by fitting a gaussian on the fourier transform of the interferogram and calculate it mean the tungsten source behaves like a black body and hence it temperature can be determine use wien 's displacement law which state that where b be wien 's displacement constant an estimate for the band gap e gap between the conduction and valence band of the p-n junction can be determine from λ a this be only an estimate a the lead emits photon over a range of wavelength thus information regard the internal structure of light source can be infer the quality of measurement be highly dependent on the alignment of the interferometer the interferometer that be built be similar to the layout of the michelson interferometer see in fig 3 the distance of an arm of the interferometer be variable a the mirror be fix onto a moveable stage when the length of the arm d be equal the central maximum be observe on the detector and the position of the stage be at the null point the length of the arm be approximately set to be equal use a ruler between the mirror and the beam splitter 12 ± 0.5 cm in our setup all the component be fix onto an optical breadboard to minimise the effect of induced vibration and mechanical impact which could lead to noise in the signal record by the detector the source be fix onto the beam splitter column either through a attachable beam collimator or be fix onto a clamp and direct at the beam splitter the breadboard ensure that the laser and the splitter be parallel to the table surface to ensure normally incident light for the alignment process a green laser be use the fine adjustment screw on the fix mirror be adjust so that the two split beam be incident normally on the beam splitter and therefore a single combine spot from the two beam can be see on the detector with the interferometer setup the null point need to be found upon set the arm to be approximately equal in length the fine adjustment screw be use to adjust the tilt such that fringe due to interference could be observe on the detector for well visibility the laser light be pas through a lens to be incident on a dark screen this magnify the straight line fizeau fringe and the circular haidinger fringe a a preliminary the central maximum of the haidinger fringe be center in the spot and the stage be move in small increment such that the fringe move far apart the null point have be pas over when the fringe start get closer instead after a certain point consequently the laser be replace by a white lead and a small range across this point be scan to obtain an interferogram over the null point with the location of the null point note the interferograms of a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten source be take by move the stage in a small range across the null point with a stage speed of 2 µms −1 and a sample frequency of 50 hz these parameter ensure that enough detail of the signal be record in agreement with the nyquist theorem the data from each interferogram be then fourier transform to obtain the frequency and thus the wavelength present in the signal a gaussian be fit onto these transforms to calculate the mean wavelength emit by each source another gaussian be fit onto the actual signal center at the null poi to determine l from the standard deviation from which ∆v be calculate use equation 4 the transforms and gaussians be normalise a different detector gain be use depend on the source ∆λ be also calculate use the mean wavelength from the fourier transform and the spectral width use equation 5 finally the temperature of the tungsten optical fibre and the mean band gap of the lead be calculate use equation 6 and 7 respectively a. white lead a can be see the wavelength extend over the visible range from around 470 nm to 660 nm λ be found to be 510 ± 10 nm from the gaussian fit ∆ν be calculate to be 16.0 ± 0.6 thz and ∆λ be determine to be 13.8 ± 0.7 nm this value be very close to the error on λ and we expect them to approximately agree e gap be calculate to be 2.43 ± 0.05 ev from the interferogram the presence of a substantial amount of noise and secondary peak can be note this may have widen l and decrease the value of ∆λ a we expect a great value a can be see from the width of the fourier transform the fit on the fourier transform perhaps do not represent the high wavelength amplitude peak in the error on λ and indicates that a fit of the sum of two or three gaussians might be well this might imply that the lead be make from a combination of two or three semiconductor p-n junction r-g-b however the spectrum of the white lead be concentrate in the blue range this be confirm by our observation of characteristic concentric blue and white spot when the lead be shone onto a black surface this be because the lead be actually a blue lead with a yellow phosphor coat which lead to a shift in some of the blue wavelength into yellow wavelength photon 1 a yellow and blue be anti-colours they combine to produce white light therefore our result confirm the physical observation and our knowledge about the function of the lead -implying the fit must be a sum of two gaussians the value of ∆λ be very close to the error on λ and we expect them to approximately agree the major peak around the blue range lead to the gaussian not accounting for the amplitude observe between 550 nm to 650 nm decrease the value of λ and explains the low than expect value of the error on λ. however the secondary peak could also be atrributed to noise perhaps manually alter the gaussian parameter and decrease noise would lead to great value for the wavelength width and the error on λ and might lead to agreement between them with small amplitude around 390 nm to 460 nm the major peak extends from 460 nm to 510 nm we also observe a secondary peak at 470 nm -perhaps suggest the fit must have be a sum of two gaussians instead of just one this maybe because the lead emits in two separate distinct blue wavelength range λ be found to be 485 ± 8 nm and ∆ν a 12.1 ± 0.1 thz therefore a ∆λ of 9.51 ± 0.23 nm be determine similar to the white lead a slight disagreement between the error on the width ∆λ and the error on λ be see the fourier transform gaussian need to be manually alter sum of two gaussians to include the small wavelength amplitude which would have increase ∆λ a we expect it to be slightly high between 20 nm to 30 nm a indicate by the width of fourier transform e gap be found to be 2.56 ± 0.04 ev for both lead the secondary peak appear due to the misalignment of the interferometer and be not high order maximum a the interferogram be not symmetric the lead do not have a uniform intensity profile due to it curve geometry to prevent the intensity from be measure diagonally across it profile a ground diffuser be use to create a uniform beam incident on the beam splitter to reduce the variable noisy intensity record many attempt be make to correct the alignment with this be the best data that we acquire eliminate noise would have lead to narrower interferograms small value for l and thus high value for ∆λ c. tungsten optical fibre λ be found to be 839 ± 127 nm and ∆ν be calculate a 51.3 ± 1.6 thz ∆λ be determine to be 121 ± 26 nm the error on λ be include within the error on ∆λ a we expect a the tungsten optical fibre show black-body behavior it temperature t be found to be 3450±520 k. the temperature of a typical tungsten filament be about 3300 k 2 the error on t include this value the difference in the value can be explain by the detector 's construction the silicon detector use cut off frequency high than 1100 nm while the source emits over 1100 nm 3 hence if these wavelength be include the value of λ would increase and thus t would decrease closer to the typical value the amplitude see over 1200 nm in the fourier transform could be noise due to the detector 's inability to detect them thus the tungsten source and interferometry also allow u to confirm a specification of the detector although the difference in value could also be attribute to random error and noise within the record signal a the quote value be include within the error in this investigation we construct a michelson interferometer to be use a a spectrometer to investigate the characteristic of light source the spectrum of white and blue lead and a tungsten optical fibre be obtain by record interferograms for each source around the null point the spectral width a frequency and wavelength be calculate ∆λ for the white lead be obtain to be 13.8 ± 0.7 nm and differ by 32 from the error on λ with an e gap 2.43±0.05 ev ∆λ for the blue lead be obtain to be 9.51 ± 0.23 nm and differ by 17 from the error on λ with an e gap 2.56±0.04 ev the spectrum of the white light allow u to confirm it internal structure and function -a blue lead with a yellow phosphur coat a a consequence the band gap of the white lead may be the same a that of a blue lead this will need to be explore in great detail in a future experiment the tungsten source be found to have a ∆λ of 121 ± 26 nm differ by 5 from the error on it λ and include it within it error the temperature of the source be determine to be 3450 ± 520 k. the difference of 4 from the quote value and the range of the fourier transform allow u to confirm the maximum of the spectral sensitivity of the detector be between 1100-1200 nm the difference in spectral width should be explore in great detail in a future experiment by fitting the sum of two gaussians to obtain more accurate width the sample frequency of the detector be set to 50 hz this be enough to include enough detail about the signal but could perhaps be increase to minimise the noise that be evident in the interferograms even far,deep,exp
144,2ndINT_FIJ609_Redacted,a michelson interferometer be use to investigate the series of wavelength that make up different source of light these source include a white lead a blue lead and a white tungsten filament lamp these series be then use to find the different spectral width that make up these light source the spectral width be found to be 4.0× 𝟏𝟎 −𝟖 ± 𝟎 𝟓 × 𝟏𝟎 −𝟖 m 1.5× 𝟏𝟎 −𝟕 ± 𝟎 𝟓 × 𝟏𝟎 −𝟕 m and 4.5× 𝟏𝟎 −𝟕 ± 𝟎 𝟓 × 𝟏𝟎 −𝟕 m respectively this thus demonstrates the difference in the two white light source beyond their colour a well a this use the peak wavelength of the filament in the lamp wiens displacement law 1 be use to find the temperature of the filament to be k. multiple wave travel the same path superimpose such that the resultant wave equal the vector sum of the individual displacement of the original wave this phenomenon be at the forefront of interferometry light from a single source be split such that two beam travel different optical path these beam be then superimpose give an interference pattern which give information about the difference in the path the michelson interferometer be a common interferometer set up from the experiment conduct by michelson and morley which be one of the early piece of evidence for the theory of special relativity it consists of a partially silver mirror which split a light source into two beam which travel to two plane mirror the beam then subsequently reflect to meet at a detector a see in figure 2 the aim of this experiment be to investigate the interference pattern of different light source use the michelson interferometer to find the spectral width of the light source a well a this wiens displacement law can be use to find a good approximation to the temperature of a filament in a light these technique be often use astronomy in observe starsusing their light to find their temperature light source be make up of a series of wavelength of light this be due to the very nature of the emission of light from a light source correspond to an energy change in an atom molecule or ion a useful approximation for the distribution of the frequency of the light be that it gaussian a the approximate distribution of the particle energy be gaussian the spectral width can be found by find the width of the curve at half the maximum intensity this spectral width coincides with the width of the peak on the interferogram with a large spectral width give a shorter width of peak on the interferogram the null point of the michelson interferometer be when the two separate beam of light travel the same distance before interfere when find the null point the only way to be sure that it be the null point which have be found be by use a white light interference this be because other interference pattern have multiple peak lead to uncertainty in which peak be the null point for example in the green laser interferogram figure 1 there be multiple peak this pattern also repeat approximately eve1y 2llllll lead to unce1tainty in whether the peak show the null point or just another constiuctive interference the reason the green laser give this `` beating `` be due to the specti•al width be so sho1t a delta function in frequency space this thus lead to ve1y large fringe width in the interferogram white light however have a large spectral v.iidth lead to ve1y sho1t peak in it interferogram make it useful in find the null point of the interferometer fourier transfom1s change the interferograllls into frequency space so that the spectral width of each of the light source can be calculate by find the width of the peak at half the maximum intensity this specti•al width demonstrates the makeup of the light source beyond it colour the tungsten light source u a filament which mean that wiens displacement law be a good approximation to the temperature of the filament where a.peak be the wavelength of great abundance in the light in m b be wien 's displacement constant equal to 2 .8977729x 10-3 mk and t be the temperature of the light source in kelvin in set up the michelson interferometer it be ensure that everything need to be con-ectly align for the best possible interferograms firstly a laser be use in the alignment of the set up -due to the accurate collimate beam the the beam splitter and light source be then place such that the light that travel through the splitter continue in a sti•aight direction where the beam splitter and light source be not perpendicular this be more accurately ensure by allow the laser to ti•avel a large distance after the splitter onto a screen and rotate the splitter to ensure this be all in line the stationary and moveable min-ors be then place along of the axis of the light from the beam splitter such that they reflect the light back to the beam splitter the distance be try to make roughly the same use a piece of sti-ing but a more accurate process follow later the reason for this u because the null point have to be in the range that the moveable minor could move otherwise it would not be easily found the laser beam then need to be make parallel v.iith the such that it travel two different path on these path it either hit a plane stationaiy llllltor or a plane moveable nwor tue plane light wave then interfere at the beaiu splitter to give an inte1ference pattem at the detector the yellow line represent the path the light take through the inte1ferometer this set up where the distance the light travel to the llll11•ors from the beam splitter be equal show the null point a l'angement surface this be do use a magnetic ruler adjust the laser and the adjustment toggle on the rniitors next the miirnrs need to be adjust such that an interference pattern be create a lens be first place on the laser this spread the light create a large image at the detector thus allow it to be easy the see the fringe create when align the beallls a screen can be place far away for a large interference pattern the stationary minor can then be adjust so that the circular interference pattern show on the screen it can be ensure that the beam travel the same path and do n't j ust meet at the screen by move the screen closer to and far from the splitter and check the interference pattern do not change the detector be then replace such that the interference pattern be centi•ed at the centi•e of the detector i.e with the centi•al maximum at the centi•e of the detector throughout this process it be vital that the optical surface remain clean and be not touch to leave any finge1prints once the interferometer be set up the null point could then be found the detector give a. graph of intensity of the light source against time when you take data point the intensity of the interference pattern at the detector be then take for a range a.round where the rough null point be of the moveable miirnr the frequency of the detector use be 50hz and so the detector need to move very slowly approximately o. lmm/s for prelirll.llla.ry result the white light source be inse1t ed in the set up and an interferogram be take for a. range approximately equal to position at which the mii -or be when the sti•ing measure the two miitors the null point be at the peak in the interference pattern and once this have be found interferograms with a slow move mirror can start to be take from figure 3 the null point be found to be approximately 7.2mm and so the interferograms be take from a range similar to this it be also note that the equipment be very sensitive to vibration for example the blip in figure 4 at approximately 6.2mm be thought to be due to vibration and in other data a bang on the surface would produce a peak up to half the size of the null point this meant that it be necessary to ensure that the surface that the equipment sat on be not touch at all time when take data upon reflection vibration could in-fact misalign the equipment meaning that a re-alignment could be conduct after each accidental vibration but this may be quite worthless a the actual effect be minimal once the null point be found interferograms could be take for a range around the null point with different light source for these data set to produce accurate interferograms the moveable mirror need to move very slowly a preliminary interferogram be take for each light source such that an approximate range of the peak could be record another final set could then be take give very precise interferograms from figure 4 the blue lead interferogram the peak width be record a 2.5x 10-5 m. this be much large than the other white light interferograms -as predict due to the sho1t spectral width of a blue lead there be also another small peak at approximately 7.275mm a this peak be not symmetrical about the central peak this must be anomalous or there be anomalous data point the side of the peak where this secondary peak isn 't present either way another interferogram should be retaken to conclude which from figure 5 the tungsten filament interferogram the peak width be record a 8.5x 10-6 m. this be much sho1t er than that of the blue lead due to the much large spectral width of the white light it be also note that there be small peak approximately 7 x 10-6 m either side of the central peak this be thought to be an inherent property of the tungsten filament a these peak be symmetrical about the central peak finally from figure 7 the white lead interferogram the peak width be record a 9 .ox 10-6 m. this peak be incredibly unifonn and symmetrical a fourier transform of the interlerograms be then take to find the spectral width of each light source figure 6 a graph of amplitude against wavelength in m for a blue lead found use a fourier transfo1m of figure 4. the distribution of wavelength in the blue lead light source could be see in figure 6. the spectral width be measw•ed to be 4.0x 10-s ± 0.5 x 10-8 m and a. gaussian be thought to be good approximation to the cwv e. the distribution of wavelength in the white lead light source could be see in figure 8. the spectral width be measure to be l.5 x 10-7 ± 0.5 x 10-7 m. there be however a dip in the cwv e at approximately 5 x 10-7 m. this could be due to a. gap in the series of wavelength that the white lead emits or a random eitor in the take of the data upon retake the data series the same result be see therefore conclude the fo1mer that there be a. gap in the series of wavelength s that the blue lead emit the distribution of wavelength in the tungsten filament lamp could be see in figure 9. the spectral width be measure to be 4.5× 10 −7 ± 0.5 × 10 −7 m. this curve be also very gaussian also use figure 9 𝜆 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 be found to be 8.8× 10 −7 m. this give a temperature of the filament to be 3292.9k a value for the temperature from 3 state that the temperature of the filament in a tungsten lamp be typically 3300k show a very similar value to that calculate from the experiment in all the interferograms there be `` noise `` affect the graph this be something which be unpreventable but it can however be reduce this can be do by reduce the vibration on the table and get high quality source of light the large the spectral width of a light source the shorter the width of it peak in an interferogram this result from this experiment agree with this statement for example the spectral width of the blue lead be 4.0× 10 −8 ± 0.5 × 10 −8 m and the white lead be and the peak width of the interferogram of the white lead be much shorter than that of the blue lead a well a this it be conclude that although the two white light source be white they be in-fact very different also the calculate temperature of the tungsten filament be found to be 3292.9k which be so close to the quote temperature of 3300k in 3 indicate a very precise set up,superficial,bal

interferometer in order to study the luminiferous ether 1 the lack of record effect provide an experimental cornerstone for the theory of relativity a fourier transform spectrometer ft have the same basic configuration a a michelson interferometer except one of the mirror can be move along one axis 2 fourier transform spectroscopy have aid breakthrough in the molecular spectrum of star and planet splitting in atomic spectrum super conductor energy-gap measurement and magnetic resonance to name a few 3 the experimental design and associate theory involve with these device be core to modern physic optical filter selectively transmit light of different wavelength a a ft can be use to analyse the constituent wavelength of a source a practical application of the spectrometer be to identify the range of wavelength pas by a filter of unknown spectral width a ft allows analysis of a light source by investigation of the effect of path difference on resultant intensity the translate mirror can be adjust so that the two light path l 1 and l 2 described in figure 1 travel different length before recombination the difference in these length be define a and be equal to the path difference between the light at recombination note that the distance l 1 and l 2 be twice the distance from the beamsplitter to the mirror if the translate mirror be move by a distance x the change in path difference be of magnitude 2x when the mirror be arrange such that l 1 l 2 correspond to d 0 the interferometer be say to be at it null point a there be no path difference between light from each source light will constructively interfere upon recombination fig 1 in a ft source light be incident on a beamsplitter which then separate the light so that it follow two different path for path l 1 light continue to propagate parallel to the source beam and be incident on the translate mirror for path l 2 light be reflect perpendicularly to the source beam so that it be incident on the mirror label fix mirror light from both path then recombines at the beamsplitter before it intensity be measure at the detector 4 fig 2 due to the action of the beamsplitter mirror m 2 appear to be parallel to m 1 in position m 2 the optical path can then be related by the angle θ and the distance d where d d 2 4 with light incoming from an extend source the angle θ will vary the geometry of figure 2 give where m be the order of interference and λ be the wavelength of the source when the mirror be set up with equal inclination the cylindrical symmetry of the situation result in circular fringe know a haidinger fringe if an angle of inclination be introduce between the mirror this symmetry be lose and straight line fizeau fringe of equal thickness be form fig 3 haidinger fringe of equal inclination which occur when θ 0 and appear to be at infinity 5 use a coherent visible light source around the null point haidinger fringe be clearly identifiable with the naked eye a the null point be approach d → 0 the fringe pattern will appear to collapse with fringe move toward the centre then disappear reduce the number of visible ring 6 this be show in figure 4. a ft allows interferograms of signal intensity against position of movable mirror proportional to path difference to be plot the peak of the path difference spectrum be locate at the null point this spectrum be useful a the intensity of the recombine beam a a function of the path difference d can be fourier transform to the intensity of the light source a a function of wavenumber inverse wavelength 2 from this the constituent wavelength of the source can be plot the coherence length l of a source be define a the optical path difference when interference visibility drop to half it maximum value 7 a the interferograms be approximately gaussian in nature we can define the coherence length of a signal intensity against path difference plot a the full width half maximum fwhm of the signal intensity against position of mirror plot this be a position of mirror=2 d and f w hm 2×distance to half intensity the fwhm of a gaussian can be found from where σ be the standard deviation of the gaussian 8 the coherence length be related to the spectral width by the equation where ν be the spectral width and c 3.0 × 10 8 m −1 to relate this to the spectral width of the wavelength of the source we use where λ be the wavelength of the light and λ be the spectral width of the wavelength 5 we can thus find value for the spectral width of the wavelength from the coherence length of the source a tungsten lamp also know a a incandescent lamp produce light through heating of a thin tungsten wire to around 2700k 9 the majority of the light produce by the lamp be in the infra-red range but some intensity of all visible wavelength be produce fig 5 a typical emission spectrum for a tungsten lamp with the region of radiation visible to the human eye label 10 the term 'optical filter refers to any device that selectively transmits/blocks wavelength of light within the visible range 350−750nm within this range of visible wavelength there be small range that correspond to specific colour the two colour examine in this experiment be green and yellow with approximate wavelength range of 500 − 550nm and 550 − 620nm respectively 11 optical filter can be broken down into two main category absorptive and dichroic the difference between the two be in how they filter light not in what they filter absorptive filter absorb the wavelength of light that be not pas whereas dichroic filter reflect them 12 filter can also be described by the range of frequencies/wavelengths that they pa low-pass filter allow frequency below a certain value to pa and block or attenuate great frequency high-pass frequency act oppositely restrict frequency below a certain value and passing frequency great than that value band-pass filter can be make from a combination of the low and high-pass filter allow wavelength within a select range to pa the ft apparatus be construct on an optical breadboard it comprise one fix base mirror a translate mirror a beamsplitter and a detector the fix base have mirror two control for adjustment of the vertical and horizontal inclination of the mirror on top the stand without alter height or base position the translate mirror involve a fix inclination mirror attach on top of a computer control translate bench the bench have a range of −12.5mm +12.5mm about it zero and could be move from any point in this range to any other point at a give speed the beamsplitter be house in a cube with transparent glass wall such that other component could be connect to it a oppose to have the light source attach to the top of a stand they be directly screw into the other end of a tube attach to the beamsplitter the detector be also connect to the computer but not directly to the bench and sample at a fix rate of 50hz in order for the spectrometer to produce measurable fringe the entire apparatus have to be precisely align this meant both in the same optical plane and with correct orientation relative to each other a the optical breadboard and all attach apparatus be from the same manufacturer the optical plane be predetermine to be at a common level attach the light source to the beamsplitter via the tube remove the possibility that the beamsplitter and light source be not in the same optical plane ensure correct orientation so that both light path be precisely follow involve great manual calibration all component be attach to the breadboard so that they seem approximately correctly align board be then place at 45 • the desire path of l 1 and l 2 so that all arm of the interferometer be optically isolated this be to prevent uninterfered light passing directly to the detector and affect result to isolate the detector from external light a black box cover the experiment while reading be be take the distance between each mirror and the beamsplitter be measure use a ruler and adjust until they be approximately equal so that d ≈ 0. these measurement do not require great precision a so long a the null point be with the 25mm movement range of the translate mirror it would be locatable a green laser be then use to calibrate the set up and find the null point this laser be use a it be a coherent monochromatic visible light source whose interference pattern be clear to the naked eye a all other component by then be properly align the only adjustment to be make to find fringe be the inclination of the fix base mirror by adjust the inclination haidinger fringe become visible the mirror be be adjust until the centre of the central fringe be exactly position so that be incident of the detector to get an intuition a to the position of the null point the detector be move so that fringe move towards the centre and disappear a in figure 4. the green laser be then replace with a tungsten lamp also attach to the tube a scan

perform to obtain useful data around the peak this be then repeat with the green and yellow filter separately the filter be attach to the output side of the beamsplitter such that the filter be the last component the light pas through before reach the detector the record spectrum be then pas through the scipy fft module a quick computational method of perform fourier transforms from the transforms amplitude be plot against wavelength the mean wavelength of each source could then be found an algorithm be write that tracked the maximum value of the curve across the position spectrum essentially outline the envelope of the peak these envelope be then fit to gaussian curve which give standard deviation σ a a fit coefficient the fwhm be determine use equation 3. from this the spectral width of the wavelength of the source with and without filter be found use equation 4 and 5. a spike in signal intensity be observe in the longer range scan of the unfiltered tungsten lamp figure 6. repeat the fig 6 a scan over a large proportion of the −12.5 +12.5mm range with a clear spike in instensity between −2 and −1mm this scan be execute at 0.1mms −1 scan at a slow speed over a small region allow the spike to be analyse in great detail a gaussian be then fit to the data this fit coefficient of the gaussian give σ 0.49µm use equation 3 the fwhm be calculate a 1.16µm the process be then repeat about the same null point with the green filter and then yellow filter attach with the green filter attach the fit gaussian give σ 7.52µm with a correspond fwhm of 17.71µm the yellow filter result be of the same order with σ 6.81µm and a fwhm of 16.03µm the data be pas through the fft algorithm to give wavelength spectrum the significantly broader path difference plot for the filter light in comparison to the unfiltered lamp light correspond to much more localise wavelength distribution the mean wavelength λ of each spectrum be list in table i alongside the generally accepted range for that colour λ range 11 the spectral width of each spectrum λ calculate use each coherence length l and equation 4 and 5 be list in table i a λ l it be clear that these value be significantly small than the true width of the spectrum see in figure fig 8 the wavelength spectrum for the unfiltered green filter and yellow filter tungsten lamp the black green and yellow line correspond to the unfiltered green filter and yellow filter light respectively result normalise so that the maximum value for each spectrum be 1. colour unfiltered 350-750nm 752nm 39nm 277nm green 500-550nm 533nm 1.3nm 23nm yellow 550-620nm 566nm 1.6nm 27nm 8. although the wavelength spectrum do not show a clear gaussian form fwhm can be found use the normalise amplitude from figure 8 and find the width of a spectrum at amplitude=0.5 this provide an alternative measurement of the spectral width for wavelength list in the table a λ f w hm these value be more appropriate than those label λ l it be clear that the unfiltered light span a great range of wavelength than 39nm a such the quote result use λ f w hm a λ. the reason for this discrepancy be unclear and be worthy of far investigation the unfiltered wavelength in figure 8 constitute many colour in the visible range which can be visually demonstrate by look at the fringe pattern produce by the ft both filter wavelength distribution show a sharp nearsymmetrical peak this be indicative of narrow band-pass filter the unfiltered tungsten lamp show the gradual increase in amplitude with increase wavelength until around 750nm expect for an incandescent light source 10 a the mean wavelength of the tungsten lamp be outside the visible range the detector be show some ability to detect infra-red wavelength it be also know a see in figure 5 that the tungsten lamp be produce wavelength great than those see in figure 8 the gradual die off of wavelength intensity between 750−1000nm be due to the detector not be able to record these wavelength a oppose to an effect of the lamp in all fourier transform wavelength plot the unit on the y ax hold little significance a to clearly see fringe the gain of the detector be adjust this mean that the amplitude of the signal be only relevant to data from the same scan not comparison between scan this mean the analysis be limited in only show the range of wavelength pas not demonstrate any secondary effect the filter may have on intensity a perfect filter would not alter intensity of the incident light however this be unlikely to be the case with real experimental data to investigate this a single value of detector gain could be identify at which all fringe be sufficiently visible the rest of the analysis would be identical except that the intensity of the green and yellow result could be compare to the unfiltered result and the attenuate effect of the filter could be measure another limitation of this method analyse filter be the lack of information regard whether they be absorptive or dichroic a the difference between the two type be in how they filter and not what they filter study the filter spectrum do not distinguish between the two to gain a deeper understand of the filter their nature must either be know from the manufacturer or determine through an another alternative empirical technique a possible method of experimental identification could be measure the temperature of the filter while in use it would be expect that in absorb certain frequency the absorptive filter would become warmer to a great extent than the dichroic filter a major shortcoming of this experiment be the lack of proper error analysis often in the analysis of spectrum standard deviation σ be quote a error this value be incorporate into the calculate value for λ l which be then reject anyway the value use for λ act a a broad uncertainty for λ a the true value for the mean must lie within the spectral range for wavelength to develop this experiment a more thorough method of handle error analysis must be developed in figure 7 a show a less smooth curve than both a and b with few data point this be a all three interferograms be produce by move the translate mirror at the same speed 0.5µms −1 even though the unfiltered result be over a much small distance range although time consume if the experiment be to be repeat it would be worth repeat the process for the unfiltered lamp at a slow speed the nyquist frequency be not consider during the analysis of this experiment a the determine wavelength fell within the expect region and the spectrum take expect shape thus it be extremely improbable that we be sample at an inappropriate frequency however if the experiment be repeat under different condition care would have to be take to ensure the sample frequency be great than the nyquist frequency the aim of the experiment be to analyse the nature of two optical filter when use with a tungsten lamp use a fourier transform spectrometer interferograms of the detect signal intensity against position of the translate mirror be then plot and fit to gaussian curve from which the coherence length and subsequently spectral width of the source be determine these value be found to be unrepresentative of the measure spectrum these interferograms be then transform to frequency spectrum use a fft algorithm from which the wavelength of the source be found along with new value for spectral width for wavelength the unfiltered light be found to have λ 752nm λ 277nm the filter be found to limit this to λ green 533nm λ green 23nm and λ yellow 566nm λ yellow 27nm in order to improve the analysis of the filter the experiment could be repeat with fix gain so the filter effect on intensity could be determine the absorptive or dichroic nature of the filter could also be investigate a more thorough method of handle error should also be employ,prediction,none
146,2ndINT_FHJ539_Redacted,"an optical fourier transform spectrometer base on the michelson interferometer be use to determine the interference pattern and spectral property of different light source in this paper the average wavelength coherence length and spectral width for a white light emit diode lead blue lead and white tungsten source be accurately obtain a within the uncertainty the experimental value match the accepted value five atomic spectral line of mercury be measure with wavelength match the accepted value to 3 significant figure the yellow mercury doublet be also observe to display a beating pattern the michelson interferometer ushered a new era of modern physic by debunk the theory that light propagate through an aether thereby validate einstein 's theory of special relativity it have many u in modern day physic include the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ligo and hyper-spectral image for earth observation 1 which make use of the interferometer 's ability to make precise displacement measurement 2 with sensitivity well than 10 −19 mhz −1 2 in this paper the michelson interferometer be use in a fourier transform spectrometer this paper u the michelson interferometer to measure the wavelength coherence length and spectral width of different light source use precise measurement of distance 3 it be also use to observe the atomic spectrum of mercury and the separation of wavelength of a non-monochromatic source the yellowdoublet in mercury which give rise to a beating effect the michelson interferometer consists of two right-angled mirror and a beamsplitter which be a partially-silvered mirror that split the incoming light source into two beam of equal amplitude e 0 4 the dielectric plate on the beamsplitter cause a phase shift in one of the beam the beam be reflect at the two different mirror and be recombine at the beamsplitter 4 a schematic layout of the set-up be show in figure 1. the beam be assume to travel only in air give the dielectric constant a unity if the distance between the mirror hence the distance traverse by the different beam d be similar an interference pattern be produce assume the light source be monochromatic constructive interference occurs when where t be the difference in the arm length of the interferometer a show in figure 1 λ be the wavelength of the light source θ be the angle to the normal and m be an integer 5 fig 1 schematic diagram of a michelson interferometer 4 where m1 the movable mirror be at right-angles to m2 the tiltable mirror the beam from the source be split into two beam by the beamsplitter and reflect at mirror m1 and m2 m2 be the virtual image of m2 a see through the beamsplitter they recombine at the beamsplitter and the interference pattern be measure by the detector in a fourier transform spectrometer mirror m1 be able to translate back and forth change d. the recombine beam be detect synchronously 6 the amplitude of the recombine beam e r be give by where ω be the frequency of the beam and δ the phase difference between the beam be give by where ∆ be the path difference 6 the intensity of e r can then be give by where k be the wavenumber 6 for a non-monochromatic light source with spectral distribution of i k and different wavenumbers k intensity i ∆ be give by which be the fourier transform of i k the intensity of the light source 6 a white light consists of wavelength range from 400nm to 750nm 5 an interference pattern only occurs when all the wavenumbers be interfere constructively this happens when equation 1 be wavelength independent give t 0. a t increase slowly the colour begin to separate until the fringe pattern be wash out completely by the interference of the many different wavelength therefore the coherence length of a white light source be very short and only a few µm long when the light source contains two similar wavelength a beating effect be observe a show in figure 2. this result in a combination of a fast oscillation in an envelope of a slow oscillation characteristic of where f 1 f 2 be the two different frequency present in the light source 7 fig 2 beating effect cause by the interference of two light source with wavelength 589.0nm and 589.6nm simulated use python this experiment u three different type of light source a light emit diode lead a tungsten filament lamp and a gas discharge lamp lead 's emit light when current flow through it in a process call electroluminescence 8 the tungsten light source work by conduct electricity along a thin and long tungsten filament which cause it to heat up the tungsten filament approximates a black-body and emits thermal radiation light from a gas discharge lamp be emit due to electron transition from high energy level 6 quantisation of the energy level give rise to discrete spectral line however the uncertainty in the excitation lifetime result in a spread of transition energy from the heisenberg uncertainty principle 3 this result in natural broadening therefore the emit light will contain a range of frequency and can no longer be model by dirac-delta function the relative motion of the atom to the observer result in a doppler shift of the frequency this increase the bandwidth which resembles a gaussian shape collision of the atom with each other will result in a lorentz broadening 3 the convolution of a gaussian and lorentz function be a voigt function due to the broadening mechanism present the light emit display certain characteristic such a a coherence length l be which be optical delay over which interference effect be observe and a spectral width ∆v which be the measure of the range of frequency emit by the source 3 l and ∆v be related by where c be the speed of light 4 the set-up of the michelson interferometer be show in figure 3. the movable mirror m1 be place on a linear stage control by a linear motor the different light source observe in this experiment be a colimated green laser a white light emit diode lead a blue lead a white light tungsten source and a penray mercury lamp the experimental apparatus be set-up carefully and the initial alignment be checked to ensure the mirror be parallel to the beamsplitter and perpendicular to each other the colimated laser beam be use to check and perfect the alignment by ensure the reflection of the laser beam on the various optical apparatus coincide with each other and the centre of the view screen the plano-convex lens be use to amplify the image during the alignment to ensure the interference pattern be appropriately centre this be do to reduce the uncertainty due to the misalignment of the apparatus and to ensure a clear interference pattern could be observe the distance between the mirror m1 and m2 and the detector d be make a similar and a small a possible to reduce the attenuation of the light source in air and increase the intensity detect this be also do to ensure the effect due to the misalignment be a small a possible the colimated green laser through a 25mm plano-convex lens be use to find the null point the position at which the optical path length difference t be zero this be do by observe the direction of the curvature of the interference fringe on a white screen set-up show in figure 3 a mirror m1 translates slowly the interval to a few mm in which the curvature revers direction contain the null point this interval be then scan quickly with the white lead to find the exact position of the null point the ground glass diffuser be place in front of the white lead to focus and enhance the uniformity of the white light source a green and yellow filter be place between source and the beamsplitter to isolate and observe different bandwidth of the white light and mercury spectrum when use the mercury source the 100 mm focal length planoconvex lens be place in front of the detector to focus the light from the mercury lamp and obtain a clearer interference pattern this be do because the mercury source be uncolimated result in a lot of scatter light and a low intensity detect the mercury lamp be also left on for more than 10 minute to allow it to sufficiently heat up the linear motor have a minimum incremental motion of 20nm 9 therefore the translational velocity of mirror m1 be take in the range of 0.2 − 4 µms −1 a a compromise between the amount of time need to obtain the result the number of data point need to get clear result and reduce the uncertainty due to the vibration and non-constant step in the linear motor the interference pattern obtain from the different light source be analyse by first apply a hilbert transform which allows the derivation of the analytic representation of the light source also call the analytic signal 10 the analytic signal be a complex value function where both imaginary and real part be function of space with no negative frequency component 10 the hilbert transform of the real part be the complex conjugate of the imaginary part of the function this allows the instantaneous amplitude 10 of the interference pattern to be obtain which be the envelope of the interference pattern although the interference pattern be best model by a voigt function due to the broadening mechanism present for mathematical simplicity a normal distribution or gaussian be use the l be give by the standard deviation σ of a gaussian which can be found by fitting a gaussian to the hilbert transform of the interference pattern the spectral width can be then calculate use equation 8. the fourier transform of the interference pattern be found use equation 5to obtain information about the emission of light from the light source since the fourier transform of a gaussian be also a gaussian the average wavelength and uncertainty can be found from the mean and standard deviation of the gaussian fit to the fourier transform of the interference pattern the experimental and theoretical value of the average wavelength coherence length and spectral width of the different light source be show in table i. table i the value of the experimental and theoretical value of the average wavelength coherence length and spectral width of the interference pattern of the light emit from different source along with their respective uncertainty the theoretical value be obtain from the manufacturing website of the different light source 9,11 the interferograms of the white and blue lead be show in figure 4 and 5 the coherence length of the blue lead be much longer compare to that of the white lead a show in table i. this be due to white light have a range of wavenumbers and therefore will only interfere when there be constructive interference between all the wavenumbers however the coherence length of the white lead be longer than that of the tungsten source a the white lead produce white light by change monochromatic blue light to white use a layeremitting phosphor on the lead 8 this also cause the average wavelength emit by the white lead to lie close to that emit by the blue lead the interference pattern of the white lead show asymmetry this be due to the non-uniformity of the source which shine with a high intensity on the right side use a ground glass increase the uniformity of the light source thereby decrease the asymmetry but do not completely fix it due to the asymmetry a skewed nonnal distribution be fit to the interference pattern to obtain an accurate value of the coherence length and spectral width the probability density function of a skewed nonnal distribution be give by j x 2ef x ax 9 where be a normal distribution function and be the cumulative distribution function give by where a be a parameter which defines the skewness of the distribution which be the measure of asymmetry of the distribution 12 the interference pattern have a value of 6.3 for a indicate it have a right skew the coherence length of the tungsten source be shorter compare to that of the white lead a show in figure 6. the fourier transfonn of the tungsten source show in figure 7 do not simulate a black-body spectrum instead it look similar to the fourier transfonn of the white lead with a high standard deviation this be due to the spectral sensitivity of the detector which be a silicon pin photodiode fig 6 the interference pattern of the white tungsten source fit with a hilbert transfonn and a skewed normal distribution function it have a short interference pattern a it emits a wide range of wavelength which only interfere constructively near the null point where t 0. that have an upper detection limit of 950nm and a low limit of 400nm 13 fig 7 the fourier transfonn of the white tungsten source fit with a nonnal distribution which be use to obtain the average wavelength emit by the source the spectrum do not resemble that of black-body radiation and instead look similar to that emit by the white lead the tungsten source be found to have an average wavelength in the infrared region a show by table i and figure 7. assume the tungsten filament act a a black-body and the peak wavelength amax be similar to the average wavelength the temperature can be estimate use wien 's displacement law give by 4 le-5 t λ max 2.898 × 10 −3 11 to give t to 3500 ± 500 k. the specification of the tungsten light source use give λ max a 1000nm and t a 2796 pm15 k 11 which be outside the range of detection of the photo-diode lead to the theoretical value not match the experimental one the average wavelength and relative intensity of mercury 's spectral line be show in table ii table ii the value of the experimental and theoretical average wavelength 14 and relative intensity for the different spectral line of mercury along with their respective uncertainty the fourier transform of the interference pattern of light emit by the mercury lamp when no filter be use be show in figure 8. three spectral line with different wavelength correspond to the blue green and the infrared region of electromagnetic radiation be observe from the fourier transform of the interference pattern fig 8 the fourier transform of the light emit by the mercury lamp fit with a superposition of three normal distribution which be use to obtain the average wavelength emit by the source three spectral line be see which correspond a blue green and infrared spectral line apply the yellow filter allows the yellow mercury doublet to be observe a show by the fourier transform of the interference pattern in figure 9. ii the peak on the right in figure 9 corresponds to 600±26 nm mercury have two spectral line that lie within the uncertainty of the wavelength obtain for peak 2 579nm and 580nm with relative intensity 900 and 400 respectively 14 compare the relative intensity of two peak with the theoretical value of the relative intensity peak 2 more closely corresponds to the spectral line with wavelength 579nm the relative intensity of the experimental value do not closely correspond to that of the theoretical value this could be due to the relative spectral sensitivity of the photodiode which varies accord to wavelength 13 or the fourier transforms inability to measure relative intensity accurately the interference of the two yellow spectral line which have similar wavelength result in a beating pattern a show in figure 10 which be very similar to the beating pattern show in figure 2. the envelope of the interference pattern can be fit use cosine function which be expect from a beating phenomenon equation 7 be use to obtain the beat frequency of the yellow-doublet which be found to be 25 ± 4 t hz the interference obtain do not have any destructive interference due to the different intensity of the spectral line show in figure 9. observe the interference pattern of the yellow-doublet over a longer range show that the beating pattern do not continue this show that although the two wavelength have very similar wavelength they be not exactly coherent with each other the big error present in the experiment be due to the limited range of wavelength which could be detect by the photodiode which might have lead to overestimate of coherence length and spectral width this be because include more wavelength of electromagnetic radiation result in the interference lose coherence faster this be especially true for the measurement of white light use the lead and tungsten wire a the relative sensitivity at 400nm and high than 930nm be very low which might have result in the intensity of the light around those wavelength be too low to be differentiate from the background noise therefore a photodiode capable of detect a wider range of wavelength with a relatively constant spectral sensitivity should be use to obtain more accurate result another cause of error in the experiment be the assumption that the beam of light only travel in air throughout the experiment however the electromagnetic wave travel through the beamsplitter which be make of glass which result in a decrease value of c use in equation 8. therefore take into account correction for the value of c will result in more accurate calculation of the spectral width the aim of this experiment be to investigate the interference pattern emit by different light source use a fourier transform spectrometer base on a michelson interferometer the light source investigate be a light emit diode lead a tungsten filament lamp and a gas-discharge lamp this be do by determine the average wavelength coherence length spectral width and atomic spectrum of the different light source the experimental value of the wavelength obtain for the blue lead white lead and white tungsten source be 485 ± 13 nm 560 ± 76 nm and 810 ± 120 nm respectively accurate to 3 significant figure five spectral line of mercury be observe and correspond to the wavelength 435 ± 23 nm 549 ± 31 nm 1010 ± 50 nm 571 ± 25 nm and 600 ± 26 the experiment be accurate in determine the different wavelength present in the light source a the value obtain in the experiment lie within one standard deviation of the theoretical value however the value obtain be not very precise with uncertainty a high a 14.8 this could have be due to the high background noise due to external vibration and light more precise method should be use to obtain well result by incorporate interferometer lock 2 and use a more precise detector such a a charge-coupled device or a fieldprogrammable gate array 15",prediction,bal
147,2ndINT_IHJ555_Redacted,this experiment demonstrates the construction and use of a michelson interferometer a simulation of the experiment be complete use python before any physical experiment the result from both simulation and the physical attempt be compare and discus by use the interferometer a a spectrometer we obtain and investigate the interferograms of a blue lead light a white lead light and a tungsten light source then fast fourier transform fft be perform on the interferograms to reconstruct the light source some interest feature discover from observation be also discus in this report albert michelson invent the interferometer in the late 19 th century when he and edward morley perform the `` michelson-morley experiment `` 1 at that time physicist believe that there must be a medium which allow the propagation of light to happen this medium be call ether they thought that ether form an ether wind across earth 's surface which control the speed of the travel light since the earth be constantly move in it orbit unless the ether maintain stationary relative to the earth all the time the light emit from a source on earth 's surface would change accord to the magnitude and direction of the ether wind 5 michelson and morley assume that if two light beam travel the same distance through ether but in different path their speed would be different and an interference pattern would be create for them to calculate the speed of ether relative to the earth therefore prove it existence however they found no evidence in the change of light 's speed regardless of which path the light travel along 6 this experiment be regard a the most famous fail experiment and be a strong evidence against the existence of ether 5 today interferometer be widely use a investigative tool in science they merge two or more source of light to create interference pattern allow scientist to measure and analyse the light source 1 a simple demonstration of the interferometer be show in fig 1. the michelson interferometer can also be use a a spectrometer by change the path length travel by the light beam the interference pattern will change and can be observe by analyse the interferograms and the resultant figure after fft be perform on them we obtain information about the location of the null point the coherence length and the spectral width for each light source a show in fig 1. the incident light emit from the source go through the beam splitter where half of the light be allow to pa through and the other half be reflect at 90 degree to the first one 1 each beam travel to a mirror then be reflect and travel back to the beam splitter where they be merge back into one single beam before travel to the detector whilst recombine they interfere with each other if the distance from the beam splitter to the two mirror be exactly the same or differ by nλ where n be an integer the two beam will interfere constructively and give a bright fringe output however if the distance travel by the two beam differ by nλ/2 where n be an odd integer the two beam will interfere destructively and cancel each other out leave no light to be detect by the detector 2 in this experiment we fix the position of one mirror and move the other mirror to change the distance travel by one of the two beam thus obtain an interferogram of the light when the two mirror be align at 90 degree to each other a circular fringe pattern which be call the `` haidinger fringe `` appear consider light come in at an angle θ a show in fig 2. constructive interference will only occur at specific value of θ which give an integral number of wavelength in the resultant path difference investigate different source of light from interferograms assume the refractive index of the medium be 1 we can derive the equation govern the angle θ to be where t be the separation of the two mirror θ be the angle form by the reflect light from the mirror and the horizontal accord to theory when two light beam with two different frequency interfere with each other a beating pattern will form a show in fig 3. the closer the two frequency be to each other the longer the separation between the null be the reason for this be that when the frequency of the wave differ by a large number the two wave be more likely to 'catch up with each other in a shorter time than two wave with closer frequency would a show in fig 4. where the two wave on the top have closer frequency than the two wave on the bottom the faster wave always form a large number of wave than the slow one do before the next null but the closer their frequency be the longer the time between each null point thus the few the number of null point form within certain time interval by perform fast fourier transform fft on the interferograms we reconstruct the light source from the resultant figure we found the coherence length of the source l which be the range before the interferogram contrast become poor by use where l be the coherence length in m c be the speed of light we found the spectral width of the source ∆ν in hz which be the measure of the range of frequency emit by the source another theory worth mention here be that object with temperature above absolute zero emits radiation one of the light source use in this experiment be tungsten light it light up by heating up the filament therefore we can use where λ 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 be the mean wavelength to calculate the temperature t in kelvin of the filament at the time when λ 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 be observe to investigate how change the path length the light travel affect the interference pattern and to find the location of the null point we built an interferometer and use different source of light to obtain several set of data for our analyzation an image of the experimental set-up be show in fig 5. we first use a green laser to align the interferometer the distance from the laser source to the two mirror and the detector be measure to be 7 inch each we use a white board and a 25mm lens to help u adjust the alignment since this be an easy way to see the position of the two light beam when the circular fringe be form a show in fig 6. the equipment be align properly and the two light beam be interfere by use a python code which control the move rate of the mirror stage we take a large amount of data to plot the interferograms since the null point be define to be the point where t=m=0 accord to equation 1 θ need to increase in order for cosθ to reach zero and to satisfy the null point condition thus the fringe will move inward if it be move towards the null point and outward if it be move away from the null point by try to find the location where the fringe change from go inward to go outward we determine the range of the null point location in order to increase our efficiency we first use the green laser to observe the fringe and narrow the range down after obtain the narrow range we only scan this range for other light source to find the null point there be many source of error present in this experiment for example since the equipment be extremely sensitive a knock on the table or people walk around result in inaccuracy of the data take since we use our judgement when we read the data from the graph there be an error associate with each reading in addition we could not completely isolate the light source whilst perform the experiment which mean that light from other source be affect the measurement we ran several simulation use python to investigate and get a rough idea of what the result would be like the image obtain from the simulation be show in fig 7. and fig 8. the wavelength we use in the simulation be approximately 600nm a the figure show when more spectral line be add the middle part remain similar but small beating pattern could be see on each side this be an indication of interference of light with two different frequency when the stage be move too fast the dark and bright fringe be change at a rate so fast that the detector be not able to record it properly when we decrease the move rate of the stage to be around 0.001mm/s the result be clearer therefore in this experiment data be take with the stage move at 0.001mm/s when the gain of the amplifier be too large the graph appear clip the top of the line becomes straight instead of curvy a show in graph 1.0. an appropriate gain be found before take our measurement graph 1.0. clip graph due to large gain of the amplifier let the mid-point of the mirror stage be zero when the mirror be move far away in positive direction from position +8mm the fringe be go outward when the mirror be move in positive direction far away from position +7mm the fringe be go inward thus we determine that the null point should be between +7 to +8mm we scan this range for the blue lead light and found the null point position to be +7.3368mm accord to the interferogram which be show in fig 9. by observe this interferogram we narrow the range of the null point position down to between +7.239mm and +7.345mm for scan other light source by observe the interferogram of light from each source we determine the position of their null point the result be show in table 1.0. the theoretical wavelength of blue light be 435nm to 500 nm a fig 10. show the wavelength of blue light obtain from our data be around 460nm to 520nm which be close to the theoretical value this prof that the fft do reconstruct the light source from this figure we also found that it mean wavelength λ 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 to be about 480.2nm and it coherence length to be 7.334 -7.340mm by use equation 2 along with the data obtain we found that the spectral width of this blue lead light to be 6.505 × 10 9 -6.510 × 10 9 hz by use the same method we found that the coherence length of white lead light tungsten light without green filter and tungsten light with green filter to be 7.333-7.340mm 7.332-7.334mm 7.320-7.350mm respectively the mean wavelength of white lead light tungsten light without green filter and tungsten light with green filter to be 603nm 857nm 556nm respectively the spectral width of white lead light tungsten light without green filter and tungsten light with green filter to be 6.505 × 10 9 -6.511 × 10 9 hz 6.510 × 10 9 -6.513 × 10 9 hz 6.500 × 10 9 -6.523 × 10 9 hz respectively these data be summarize in table ii the interferograms of the tungsten light be interest fig 11. show that some data point seem to go horizontally which be unexpected we think that those data point be take when the mirror first start to move or when it stop since the equipment be very sensitive a tiny shake or movement can have big impact on the data which be the one take when no filter be use we see that the middle shape remains similar for both case however the side appear to have beating pattern when a filter be use we think that this be because the filter filter out some wavelength the remain light 's wavelength be very different from each other thus when they interfere with each other a beating pattern be observe also the data seem messier we think that this be due to the unclearness of the filter after fft be perform on the interferograms the shape of the one without filter look like one for black body radiation a show in fig 13. the tail never go to zero because all matter with temperature above absolute zero emit radiation tungsten 's high melt point be useful in this case since the filament heat up during the process 4 we use equation 3 to calculate the temperature of the filament when λ 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 be observe which turn out to be 338k from fig 13. we can see that the range of wavelength exceeds the visible light range this be because when atom heat up they gain energy when they fall back to a low energy level the excessive energy radiate away and be see a light however only a small fraction of radiate energy occurs in the visible wavelength range the rest of the energy radiate away at infrared wavelength 4 another interest thing about tungsten light we notice be that when we be at a very close distance to the null point light emit from the tungsten light source appear to have different color on the detector a show in fig 14. this be because when we be near the null point the interference be the strong and the interference of the light with different wavelength give off light with different color the interferograms of a blue lead a white lead light and a tungsten light be obtain in this experiment fft be perform on these interferograms to reconstruct the light source from the resultant figure we obtain the mean wavelength coherence length and the spectral width of the source tungsten light without filter appear to have the long mean wavelength which be 857nm this be follow by 603nm of the white lead light 480nm of the blue lead light and 56nm of the tungsten light with a green filter use by use the coherence length obtain we calculate the spectral width for each of the source which be 6.505 × 10 9 -6.510 × 10 9 hz 6.505 × 10 9 -6.511 × 10 9 hz 6.510 × 10 9 -6.513 × 10 9 hz 6.500 × 10 9 -6.523 × 10 9 hz for the blue lead light white lead light tungsten light without green filter and tungsten light with green filter respectively by compare the interferograms of each light source and the resultant figure after fft be perform on them we discover some interest feature about these source for example the miss wavelength of the tungsten light when a green filter be use on it the dissymmetry of the white lead interferogram etc regard operation in the lab no major issue occur throughout the experiment in conclusion in this experiment we construct an interferometer investigate the effect of fast fourier transform on interferograms compare and discus the resultant figure and obtain unique data for each light source,deep,the
148,2ndINT_YMJ516_Redacted,he application of device which emit radiation be almost a numerous a the device themselves while light-emitting diode which saw their first practical production in 1962 1 be originally only able to produce emission in the infra-red region they have since be design to emit light across the visible spectrum for use in aviation light automotive headlamp and digital display in fact in 2014 a nobel prize be award to nakamura et al for their work in the 1990 's on the production of the first blue lead 2 lamp contain tungsten or mercury have be use for domestic light but many have be discontinue after the discovery of their high uv emission in order to reliably design and manufacture these device it be important to be able to characterize them in term of the spectrum they emit the intensity of their emission and their operating temperature one technique for characterize these source be interferometry by observe the behaviour of interfere electromagnetic wave it be possible to learn about the source itself the medium that the wave be travel through and also the equipment use to detect it the result of interferometry be call an interferogram and from the fourier analysis of these we can find the emission spectrum of source an example of an interferometer be use in modern physic be the ligo experiment in america where use an interferometer with 4 km long arm the first detection of gravitational wave be make by observe the slight fluctuation of the interference pattern cause by a change in the length of the interferometer arm ten time small than the size of the proton 3 evidence by this example interferometry be a staple in experimental physic and it be by this method that this experiment analyse the property of a range of optical source the lead 's study in this experiment be base on semiconductor diode these emit light by provide enough energy for electron to cross the gap between the valence and conduction band and recombine with hole result in photoemission the reason that lead 's have a finite bandwidth be that the band gap be not the same distance everywhere produce a spectrum of possible energy for emit photon the impurity in the semiconductor material be such that the spectrum of lead 's can be approximate by a gaussian distribution an incandescent tungsten filament lamp produce white light from a thin wire carry a high current the filament becomes hot with many device have operating temperature of around 3000 k 4 tungsten filament lamp can be approximate to blackbody and so their spectrum can be expect to follow planck 's law where 𝐸 𝜆 be the energy emit per unit volume of a cavity in the blackbody λ be the wavelength emit and t be the temperature of the source 5 for a blackbody of temperature t the peak wavelength λmax can be found use wien 's displacement law 2 where b be the `` wien 's displacement constant `` 6 this can be derive from planck 's law 1 numerically use newton 's method while a range of `` monochrome `` lead 's can be produce by vary the semiconducting material use to produce a white lead a common method involves coat a blue lead in a phosphor a popular choice for this be ce 3+ yag which emits a broad bandwidth of yellow light 7 the combination of the narrower blue band and the wider yellow band produce an overall white light by have those photon emit by the characterisation of optical source by method of interferometry and fourier analysis t lead which do n't pa through the coat excite the phosphor electron result in yellow emission this phosphor band can also be approximate to a gaussian two source of the same wavelength will interfere when superpose on the same position with bright concentric circular fringe form at the point where the path difference between the two source be an integer number of wavelength for two source of different wavelength fringe can still form but the point at which they do be dependent on the difference between the two wavelength for example the separation t where the first maximum be found for source of wavelength λ1 and λ2 must satisfy the follow condition a more source be add the point where constructive interference form ring become more complicate to calculate however the one point where fringe can always be found be the point where the separation be zero this be know a the null point and be where due to the change in the degree of interference the amplitude of the resultant waveform be most sensitive change in separation this be a sensible place to scan to form an interferogram of a source contain multiple wavelength such a a blackbody the process of the experiment involve analyse the source through spectroscopy by first record the signal produce by the source a they interfere at the null point and then use fourier analysis to characterise the source in term of their emission spectrum the michelson interferometer use be assemble a described by figure 1. from there the difference in the path of the beam d1 -d2 determines the type of interference observe at the detector the interferometer be assemble such that d1 ≈ d2 so that the detector be near the null point then by scan short distance between every millimetre the rough position of the null point be found to find the null point a green laser of wavelength 532 nm be use a it form bright fringe which could be use to as whether the mobile mirror be move towards or away from the null point if the mirror be approach the null point the concentric fringe would appear to collapse inwards if the mirror be recede from the null point the fringe would appear to expand outwards with the null point locate the green laser be replace with a blue lead a white lead and then a collimate tungsten lamp for each of the source the mobile mirror be programmed to scan across the null point and the signal detect be record on a computer the data record by the detector be unpacked in a python module and a 2d plot library be use to produce interferograms of each of the source use a fast fourier transform package the data be employ to produce the wavelength domain representation of the signal it be expect that the step size between data point should be 1 -2 nm to verify this we form a histogram of the distance between adjacent data point the result of this be described by figure 2. we found that there be distribution of step size centre about -1 nm this value be non-zero because the mobile mirror have a speed and be negative because the mirror be move from right to left in this scan we take the mean of step size in the second and third quartile to omit those near the begin and end because at these point we found the motion of the mobile mirror be stutter this mean be use to plot the theoretical fit for the source spectrum since the blue lead be effectively monochromatic we would expect the interferogram of it signal to display a singlet wave packet this be what be found and the fourier transform of the data be displayed in figure 3. use the gaussian the lead be estimate to have a peak wavelength of 473.84 ± 0.48 nm with the error arise from the covariance matrix of the gaussian fit this place the blue lead in the blue region of the visible spectrum 9 a expect the fwhm of the gaussian be calculate to estimate the bandwidth of the blue lead to be 30.48 ± 1.11 𝑛𝑚 the white lead be expect to have two peak in it wavelength space representation one peak in the blue region of the visible spectrum and a second peak in the yellow region figure 4 show the wavelength spectrum of the white lead the profile of the fit in figure 4 be that of the sum of two gaussians indicate two main emission band the first band be found to have a peak wavelength of 460.83 ± 1.92 𝑛𝑚 and a bandwidth of 34.86 ± 4.18 𝑛𝑚 these value be like those of the blue lead which be encourage a we know the white lead contains one of these the second band be found to have a peak wavelength of 585.78 ± 2.39 𝑛𝑚 which be in the yellow region of the visible spectrum and a bandwidth of 151.88 ± 6.06 𝑛𝑚 this be much wider than the blue peak which indicates that there be a wide range of allow transition in the yellow region of the visible spectrum possibly due to there be multiple layer of slightly different phosphor coat the similarity in the amplitude of these two peak be what give the lead it clean white colour have one of the peak be significantly great than the other the lead would have appear to be a cooler or warmer white figure 5 show the simulation of a white light source the profile of the interferogram in figure 6 closely follow the prediction make by the simulation in figure 5. here the tungsten lamp appear to behave a expect the tungsten lamp be found to operate at a temperature of 2796 k 10 and be expect to behave a a blackbody of this characteristic temperature for the tungsten lamp a model utilise planck 's law 1 be use to attempt a fit curve to the profile of the data the result of this be found in figure 7. here the tungsten lamp be discover to not behave a expect base on the know operating temperature of the tungsten we would expect a wavelength space representation which peak later and with a longer tail than that we see in figure 7. if we omit the tail of the profile of the experimental data and assume the lamp be act a a blackbody we find use wien 's displacement law 2 that the lamp have an operating temperature of 3625 k. this be far above the know operating temperature it be possible that a tungsten lamp be in fact much different than a blackbody however there be much evidence external to this experiment that suggests this be n't the case with this rule out the practical conclusion be that the detector have a finite range of wavelength over which it can reliably detect a signal this detection drop of rapidly for wavelength great than 800 nm for this reason it be not sensible to characterise the tungsten source use this apparatus this experiment use a michelson interferometer and fourier analysis technique to characterise a blue lead and a white lead an attempt be make to characterise a tungsten lamp but it be conclude that a reliable estimate of it property could not be make with our experimental apparatus the property of the characterise source be described in table 1,superficial,the
149,2ndINT_CCY232_Redacted,the theory behind the analysis for the interferograms be relatively simple to understand the spectral line qualitatively the mean wavelength and spectral width could be explore mean wavelength of a light source can be found by assume constant distance between sample find the difference in position between peak in the interferogram give the amount the stage be move by between these point this mean the path difference in light be twice that amount a light travel to and from the mirror hence the wavelength be double the distance between peak spectral width calculation require an assumption of a gaussian distribution the full width at half maximum 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 can be found from the interferogram and from this the standard deviation 𝜎 can be found use here the standard deviation act a the coherence length of the source therefore the spectral width ∆𝑣 can be found from where 𝑐 be the speed of light in a vacuum this can be turn into a wavelength width ∆𝜆 use light-emitting diode lead be small robust and efficient light source they work on the principle that when a voltage be apply across it electron recombine with electron hole inside the lead this release energy in the form of photon where the wavelength of the photon release correlate to the physical characteristic of the device 3 there be two conventional method for create white light in lead firstly the rgb method combine red green and blue lead to create white light secondly the phosphor method combine a short wavelength lead such a blue or uv with a yellow phosphor coat some of the short wavelength photo be convert to yellow photon and these combine to create white light the interferometer be built follow the general schematic show in figure 1. the mirror be situate approximately 16cm from the beam splitter a see in figure 2. a green laser be use a the light source and a temporary black screen be insert in front of the detector to align the apparatus successfully the angle of the tilt mirror be adjust until the laser dot from both path be overlap the move mirror set on a motor stage be move to it zero point a the basis of alignment a broadening lens be use to expand the beam and allow the fringe to be see well the lens be insert before the beam splitter because if it be insert after then any error in misalignment would be magnify by the lens fringe from the green laser be see on the black card in order to find the null point the stage be move in increment of 1mm between the full range of -10mm and 10mm the number of fringe be count for each position and it be found that the number decrease and increase around the null point the range of the null point be establish to be between -2 and 0. the laser be replace with a white lead and data be take between this range at first the stage be move at a speed of 0.0002 mm/s however the result data be very irregular this be because the stage do not move continuously so multiple measurement be take at each position additionally the stage be not perfect and vibrate slightly between movement the speed be increase to 0.001 mm/s and improve data be take the asymmetry be cause by the lack of precision in the set up if all component be at exact right angle to one another there would be no angular vary path difference and the interference would be more symmetric therefore ground glass be insert in front of the white lead to disperse the light which in turn minimises any error in misalignment another set of data be take despite the add dispersion measure the data be still relatively skewed when re-observing the set up it be found that the white lead be rest against the ground glass create an unwanted reflection effect the lead be reposition and a new data set be take here the symmetry be clearly improve however the data take be once again very irregular repeat data point be take at the same position rather than at regular interval to explore this far a histogram of the frequency of distance move by the mirror on the motor stage be take for the above data set very often the distance move be almost 0. this suggests that the speed of the motor be set erroneously to compare the stage movement histogram be plot for the second data set and a regular distribution around 20nm be found a expect by the specification of the instrument therefore for analysis the more regular albeit asymmetric data set be to be use a the asymmetry do n't play too important a role in determine the spectral distribution additionally the white light interference pattern be observe by eye and it be found that the colour spectrum be mirror around the null point this be due to the vary wavelength of visible lightsince blue have a small wavelength than red the interference pattern go red to blue a it approach the null point and then blue to red a it recedes from it the null point be a dark fringe due to the dielectric plate on the beam splitter use the same method of a mount lead in front of ground glass an interferogram be take for the blue lead a well the interferogram be see to be very regular and symmetrical apart from a deviation on the left of the null point this could have be cause by several physical factor notably a disturbance to the equipment such a a knock against the desk or some 'zero distance stage movement rather than the desire 20nm a explore earlier the mean wavelength be measure from the interferograms of the white lead and the blue lead to avoid the deviation in the data the distance be calculate over 10 peak at a time divide and then average since the distance between sample be not truly constant an error in wavelength be derive from this it can be see from figure 6b that the vast majority of distance move by the stage be between 0 and 40nm hence the error be chosen to be ±20nm finally the mean wavelength of the white and blue lead be found to be 500±20 ×10 -9 m and 480±20 ×10 -9 m. the spectral width be measure from the interferometer for both lead a outline in the theory section the spectral width of the blue lead be found to be 29±7 ×10 -9 m. the error be derive from the lack of precision in interpolate the full width at half maximumthe width have to be measure between discrete wave peak on the interferogram similarly the spectral width for the white lead be found to be 90±20 ×10 -9 m. this be much wider than the blue lead demonstrate that white lead be form of more frequency than blue fourier transforms be also take and be show below the peak wavelength from the fourier distribution for the white lead be found to be 470±20 ×10 -9 m and 610±20 ×10 -9 m left and right peak respectively where the error be carry through from the stage inaccuracy average this the mean wavelength be found to be 540±30 ×10 -9 m where the error be add in quadrature this differs from the previous value however the error overlap so the difference most likely arises from the inaccuracy of the method for the blue lead it be found to be 480±20 ×10 -9 m. this correlate perfectly with the wavelength found by average the interferogram distance suggest that the method work best for regular distribution such a the blue interferogram from the fourier transform it be see that the white lead spectrum be much broader than the blue spectrum due to the many wavelength that constitutes it this validates the inverse relationship a mention in the theory section the blue lead have a sharp and narrow peak at the appropriate wavelength for blue light whilst the white lead be compose of a more indigo tint blue and orange a extrapolate from the visible light spectrum diagram below wavelength distribution of visible spectrum wavelength obtain from analysis correlate well with the visible colour produce by lead 5 this indicates that the white lead be of the phosphor type rather than the rgb a there be no green spectrum to be see in the fourier transform the main aim of the project be to build a michelson interferometer and to use it to explore the interference and spectral distribution of light interferograms of a white and blue lead be take and analysis be complete to find it 's comprise wavelength a expect the blue lead have a mean wavelength of 480±20 ×10 -9 m and have a sharp narrow spectral line with a short spectral width this contrast with the much broader spectral line for the white lead which be comprise of wavelength in the blue and orange region of the visible spectrum at 470±20 ×10 -9 m and 610±20 ×10 -9 m respectively furthermore this suggest the white lead to be of the phosphor typea method of create white light use a blue lead with a phosphor coat,superficial,the
150,2ndINT_JWI426_Redacted,we begin by review the basic concept behind implement a michelson interferometer a a fourier-transform spectrometer along with the associate theory behind this and the coherence length of a source we then detail the standard experimental setup procedure in which interferometer alignment be achieve by use of a monochromatic laser and the null point be found use a full spectrum lead by take the noise filter fft of interferograms to form spectrogram for a green laser white lead and blue lead a similar process be then carry out for a tungsten lamp and lowpressure mercury discharge tube both with and without the addition of green and yellow filter for all configuration the coherence length be approximate use a gaussian method for the tallest peak and by use a more sophisticated method involve autocorrelation function we then conduct a deeper analysis to determine the extent to which factor such a system misalignment and noise may have affected our result the michelson interferometer be perhaps the most well-known amplitude-splitting interferometer with it name hail from it be a variant of the apparatus use in the now famous 1887 michelson-morley experiment it have since remain a tremendously useful piece of apparatus with it see use in application range from the ligo interferometer 1 to fourier transform spectroscopy we will be use the latter of these application to measure the wavelength spectrogram for various source from which we can find the approximate coherence length of the source the interferometer consists of two mirror which be initially an equal distance 𝑑 from a central beam splitter along with a light source and detector arrange a show in figure 1. a the path difference 𝜀 between the two beam be varied by move the mirror opposite the detector the intensity 𝐼 at the detector will cycle between destructive and constructive interference for monochromatic light of wavelength 𝜆 this will happen every time 𝜀 be some multiple of 𝜆/2 note that 𝜀 be twice the stage offset from the null point ∆ since move the mirror by some increment have the effect of change the path difference by twice that increment we can then note the intensity be the complex modulus of the amplitude and use the complex exponential form of cosine to find if we then define 𝐼 2𝐸 𝐸 along with the wavenumber 𝑘 2𝜋/𝜆 we can write note that this be only for a monochromatic source if we consider a source which instead be compose of a vary spectral distribution give by 𝐼 𝑘 we need only sum over all the contribution from the differ spectral component by replace 𝐼 with 𝐼 𝑘 and integrate to yield from this it becomes clear that the rh be simply the cosine form of the fourier transform ℱ 𝐼 𝑘 of the wavenumber distribution since this establishes 𝜀 and 𝑘 a a fourier pair we can assert that we need only take the fourier transform of our measure interferogram 𝐼 𝜀 to obtain the wavenumber and by extension the wavelength spectrum of a source the coherence length of a source 𝐿 be the distance travel by a light wave over which it maintains a certain degree of coherence the formula for the coherence length of a gaussian spectrum with peak wavelength 𝜆 be give by where 𝑛 be the refractive index and ∆𝜆 be the spectral width of the source which we define a the range of wavelength over which the magnitude of the spectral component be great than the full-width-at-halfmaximum fwhm in the case of the michelson interferometer the coherence length be especially important a system misalignment will differ the phase difference between the two beam a the travel mirror be move which can have drastic affect on the quality of measure interferograms we can extend the definition of coherence length to apply to an arbitrary spectrum to do this we define the coherence factor a the autocorrelation between the two interfere wave a a function of time 2 and use the wiener-kolmogorov theorem to obtain we can then convert this into a function of shift displacement 𝑥 by use 𝑥 𝑐𝑡 by use 𝑐 𝑓𝜆 we can also note 𝑑𝜆 −𝑐𝑑𝑓/𝑓 which allows u to express 5 directly in term of the wavelength spectrum 𝐼 𝜆 since we be deal with a discrete signal our integral becomes a sum over the discrete 𝜆 and 𝑑𝜆 → ∆𝜆 the space between each wavelength we then obtain our final expression for the coherence factor a the coherence length can then be define a the value of 𝐿 for which γ 𝐿 𝑟γ 0 a before the choice of 𝑟 varies on the definition we wish to use to be consistent with the gaussian method 's use of the fwhm we will use 𝑟 0.5 to define 𝐿 unless state otherwise we begin the experiment by construct the michelson interferometer on an optical breadboard with arm length of 𝑑 ≈ 20𝑐𝑚 for all data collection run the entire setup be enclose within a black enclosure to reduce background interference for the alignment procedure a collimate monochromatic 532nm green laser be secure directly to the beam splitter this be then adjust until it be align with the breadboard grid with the beam centre on the travel mirror the travel mirror be secure directly to the breadboard and be interfaced directly with a computer for control and data collection the stationary mirror be then move and fine adjust until the beam fell on it centre and the final image form fizeau fringe on a screen place at the detector the presence of such fringe be also checked with the screen approximately a metre behind the detector position to give great confidence that correct alignment have be achieve a diverge lens be then insert between the laser and beam splitter which lead to the formation of concentric circular hadinger fringe a final check of alignment be do by carry out a scan over the stage position range of 𝑥 −12mm to +12mm a small gradient of the mean intensity corresponds to well alignment we repeat the realignment process until the gradient appear negligible over the full range with the system align the next step be to determine the position of the null point 𝑥 to do this we replace the green laser with a white tungsten source before a scan between 𝑥 −5𝑚𝑚 to 5mm be carry out this allow u to determine the approximate position of the null point in the first few scan we attempt to use a stage step of approximately 6nm which lead to erratic bunching in data point we later found this be because the stage have a minimum travel of approximately 20nm thus the 6nm travel command result in a breakdown of the stage 's ability to resolve it own position from this point only step value large than 20nm be use to avoid this undesirable effect a high resolution scan be then make between ±1 from the approximate null point which give u a detailed interferogram for tungsten around the null point the peak of the envelope of the interferogram show in figure 7 a corresponds to the null point position this process be repeat with and without the presence of ground glass between the source and the beam splitter the use of ground glass be qualitatively see to reduce the asymmetry of the interferogram about the null point with the unfiltered tungsten scan complete we next take scan for tungsten with green and yellow filter apply separately in both case a longer scan range be use to accommodate the introduction of the envelope beating now occur on either side of the central maximum the tungsten source be then replace with a lowpressure mercury lamp which be not secure directly to the beam splitter the same process of take a scan for both the green and yellow filter be then do at the end of the experiment we begin to investigate the zeeman effect in the mercury green line although due to time constraint this could not be peruse in depth the green laser interferogram show a clear sinusoidal shape show in figure 3. the fft before and after a noise filter 1 of this signal show in figure 3 suggests the source be not exactly monochromatic with multiple different peak within the green range alternatively we can split the interferogram up into section over which we assume there be only a single wavelength active figure 5 show how the fit wavelength for each section varies with the stage position the fit wavelength varies in a roughly periodic fashion suggest the spread in wavelength be in part due to some form of misalignment broad spectrum source such a the lead 's and unfiltered tungtsen lamp be comprise of many spectral component meaning they have a very localise interferogram hence their utility in find the null point from the interferogram in figure 8 we obtain an approximate peak wavelength of 742nm use wein 's displacement law we can calculate the temperature correspond to this peak wavelength to be approximately 3910k this result must be incorrect a this surpasses the melt point of tungsten which be approximately 3695k 3 a possible explanation for this be that the detector be less sensitive in the ir range meaning the spectrogram peak at a low high energy wavelength under ideal condition the wavelength spectrum of the filter source should depend only on the raw spectrum and the spectral width of the filter under normal condition the mercury green line be stable with a wavelength of 546.1nm 4 and can thus be use to quantify the variation in the stage 's movement in theory we could have use this to then improve our spectrogram by alter the distance between our fft sample in accordance with the stage variation this be decide against a from figure 13 we can see there be some amplitude modulation indicate poor alignment thus use this data would have likely decrease the quality of our spectrogram another way of investigate stage movement be to consider how stable it speed be to do this we can plot distance against time for the stage travel in figure 15 a and b show how the average speed and linear regression coefficient vary for the green mercury scan here the mean value of r be 0.9998 ± 0.0005. the fact that the stage speed be not stable will decrease the quality of our spectrogram table i. a summary of the full spectral width at half maximum and the coherence length obtain by approximate the large peak of the spectrum a a gaussian and apply 4 the uncertainty here be derive use 8 show in the appendix the value for the refractive index of air be take a 𝑛 1.0003±0.0001 5 all 𝜆 value be assume to have an uncertainty of 1nm the coherence length obtain by consider the full spectrum and use 7 be show in the rightmost column from table i it be clear that the presence of multiple peak within a spectrogram can have a significant impact on the validity of the gaussian spectrum assumption source such a the colour filter tungsten lamp which have multiple large peak appear to be particularly affected in this way by employ the michelson interferometer a a fourier transform spectrometer we have be able to determine the approximate coherence length of several source when align correctly such a setup can produce exquisitely accurate measurement a feat which be found to be surprisingly challenge over the course of the experiment if the experiment be to be repeat great emphasis should be place achieve correct alignment particularly for the mercury lamp with the green filter this would not only allow u to quantify stage movement variation bus also enable u to investigate the how zeeman splitting affect the coherence length of mercury lamp,expert,the
151,2ndINT_PLS878_Redacted,the aim of the experiment be to determine property of lead and tungsten lamp source use interferometry this be do by shin light from these source into an interferometer and then fast fourier transform the interferograms to obtain wavelength spectrum for the light through fitting a gaussian to the spectral peak we obtain the mean wavelength and spectral width of the light for the tungsten lamp we obtain a mean wavelength of 856±59 nm and spectral width of 279 nm for the blue lead we found a wavelength of 464±10 nm and a spectral width of 23 nm and for the white lead we found a wavelength of 595±50 nm and a spectral width of 140 nm likewise for the green and yellow filter tungsten lamp we obtain mean wavelength of 544±13 nm and 583±18 nm and spectral width of 39 nm and 28 nm respectively these result agree with the expect mean wavelength and spectral width to test the black body nature of the tungsten lamp we subject it to wiens displacement law and derive a temperature of 3389±234 k which do not contain the state value of 2796 k within it error range this difference be likely down to the inability of the detector to detect in infrared range he main objective of the experiment be to determine property of light source such a the mean wavelength emit and the spectral width use interferometry this be do by feed light from a variety of different source into an interferometer the interference pattern be detect by a photodetector and then fourier transform through computer code for the analysis 1 this allow a wavelength spectrum to be produce along with the result on the mean wavelength and spectral width the investigation be important a it enables the property of a light beam to be deduce when no other effect be present so a to act a a comparison for far interferometry experiment such a the detection of gravitational wave by ligo 2 the michelson interferometer work by splitting a light beam into 2 distinctive beam reflect them off 2 perpendicular mirror and then recombine the beam when they be at right angle to each other plane wave recombine will interfere and the interference pattern will be determine by the path difference between the 2 beam from their respective mirror to where they recombine if the path difference be an integer number of wavelength then the beam will meet in phase to constructively interfere to form a bright fringe if the path difference be a half integer number of wavelength then the beam will meet completely out of phase and destructively interfere to form a dark fringe in addition to this the orientation of the mirror determines the shape of the fringe have the mirror perpendicular to each-other creates a cylindrical symmetry for the reflect light result in circular haidinger fringe by tilt one of the mirror the cylindrical symmetry be broken so straight line fizeau fringe will be form instead 1 deduce property of light source use interferometry -- va1ying the path difference of monochromatic plane wave light ie by shift the position of one of the minor will result in a se1ies of alternate bright and dark fi.inges with an amplitude that increase to a maximum at the null point where the path difference be 0. alternatively use light make up of 2 frequency will produce the same pattern of bright and dark fringe but with an amplitude that modulates a show in figure 1. a fomier transfo1m of these amplitude signal will generate the frequency that make it up in the fo1m of spectral line conesponding to the separate wavelength of light that constitute the beam the broader the spectral line the nanower the interferogram i these spectral line can be approximate a gaussian an approximation that be most fitting for lamp emit light in this case the mean wavelength can be approximate from the peak wavelength of the gaussian and the spectral width can be found use where bj be the spectral width and fwhm be the full width at half maximum namely the width of the gaussian at half it 's height the spectral width be a measure of the range of frequency emit by the source i lose energy and emit photon of a specific frequency to generate a ce1tain colour in order to fo1m white light lead 's often contain multiple chip of different colour which combine to fo1m white light 4 the equipment be set up a show in figure 3. great c.are be take to ensure that the minor be perpendicular to eachother and that the light beam be perpendicular to the mi1rnrs to ensure a clear inte1ference pattern this be initially do by eye with the aid of the magnetic mler which help to align all component conectly finer tune be do by turn on the green laser and alter the 01ientation of one of the minor until clear circular haidinger fringe be see for this a lens be use to expand the beam into a broaden source to make the fringe clearer the mobile minor stage be then move over it entire 20mm range until we obse1ved a change in the direction of movement of the haidinger fringe to indicate the presence of the null point and the procedure be redone with a small range ultimately we scan through the small length with the white lead until we saw a large increase in the amplitude of the interferogram highlight the null point position this be necessa1y so that all the spectroscopy expe1iments could be perfo1med around the null point to allow u to obtain the large amplitude inte1ferograms which could then be fast fourier transform to produce spectral line for analysis i essentially the only interest data be around the null tungsten lamp source work by heating up a tungsten filament by passing electricity through it to the point that it emits light continuously in this way it behaves a a black body emitter and would be expect to emit all wavelength of light a a black body the wavelength emit by the tungsten lamp would follow wiens displacement law give by where t be the temperature and a.peak be the peak wavelength i point the green laser be then replace with a blue lead and the minor stage be set to move a few tenth of a millimeter through the null point position and the interferogram be obtain from the detector this procedure be then repeat for a white lead a tungsten lamp and finally a tungsten lamp with a green filter and then a yellow filter each interferogram be then cut so that only the high amplitude data around the null point be include so a to ensure that only the relevant data be fourier transform and hence accurate spectral line be obtain 1 after the interferograms be fast fourier transform gaussian curve be fit to the spectral line for the blue lead and filter tungsten lamp the mean wavelength be take from the peak wavelength on the gaussian a the light be make up of only 1 main wavelength this can not be do for the white lead and unfiltered tungsten lamp a they be comprise of multiple wavelength so the mean wavelength be calculate by measure the width of the interferogram over the null point position and then divide this by the number of wave we measure over the spectral width for each spectral peak be then found use 1 for the tungsten lamp a mean wavelength of 856±59 nm and a spectral width of 279 nm be obtain whilst for the blue lead a wavelength of 464±10 nm and a spectral width of 23 nm be found and for the white lead we deduce a wavelength of 595±50 nm and a spectral width of 140 nm for it wide peak likewise the green and yellow filter tungsten lamp produce mean wavelength of 544±13 nm and 583±18 nm and spectral width of 30 nm and 28 nm respectively the mean wavelength for the blue lead and the green filter tungsten fit comfortably within the expect wavelength range of these respective colour be 450-495 nm 5 for blue and 495-570 nm for green whilst the mean wavelength for the yellow filter tungsten be within the accepted range although it error range do exceed the limit of 570-590 nm however due to the approximate nature of the wavelength limit and the fact the error range only oversteps the yellow range by a few mm this do not raise any concern the unfiltered tungsten mean wavelength suggests the tungsten lamp mostly emits in the short wavelength infrared spectrum a can be expect from the fact it generates light by intensely heating a filament wire in addition the large spectral width highlight the fact the white tungsten light be comprise of a large number of vary wavelength due to it continuous emission a a black body this be most evident when compare to the comparatively small spectral width of blue lead and green and yellow filter tungsten which reflect the single frequency nature of the light fig 5. a graph show the wavelength spectrum for a white lead 1 both peak be fit with a gaussian fig 6. a graph show the wavelength spectrum for a blue lead 1 here a lorentzian fit would be more suitable than a gaussian fig 7. a graph show the wavelength spectrum for yellow filter tungsten lamp fit with a gaussian 1 an unexpected dip can be see a a black body emitter the tungsten lamp would be expect to follow wiens displacement law use 2 a temperature of 3389±234 k be derive for the tungsten lamp which do not contain the state value of 2796 k within it error range this discrepancy be most likely explain by the fact the detector use can not detect infrared light meaning valid data in the infrared range be exclude from the fourier transform result in the peak wavelength be small than it should be this fact also explains the difference between figure 4 and the expect black body curve namely the sharp drop of the data to 0 amplitude after a certain distance into infrared range a oppose to an asymptote with the x-axis the error introduce by this could be account for by use a detector that can detect in the infrared region for the white lead 2 peak can clearly be see in figure 5. this highlight the different method of generate white light undertook by the lead compare to the continuous emission of the tungsten lamp here each peak corresponds to the 2 wavelength of light generate by the 2 semiconductor chip within the lead which mix to form white light however the gaussian curve do not seem to fit the data a well a it do for the tungsten graph the data be sharper and narrower than the gaussian near the peak and do n't drop off a rapidly which be characteristic of a lorentzian curve 6 -this be most obvious with figure 6.the suitability of a gaussian for the tungsten graph suggests that the thermal emission of light be well model a a gaussian and so the fact gaussian curve fit the lead graph relatively well highlight thermal effect cause some light emission in the lead model the wavelength spectrum of the lead 's after a lorentzian would be a way of improve the experiment in addition to this the sensitivity of the detector result in a lot of noise be picked up this error could be reduce by repeat the experiment in an isolated room an unexpected result be obtain with the sharp dip in figure 7 and 8. this be clearly not 2 separate peak a it be obtain from monochromatic light and be unlikely to be noise due to it size meaning a point of far investigation could be to probe this range with more reading to get high resolution data the aim of the experiment be to deduce property of lead and tungsten lamp source use interferometry this be do by feed light from these source into an interferometer and then fast fourier transform the result interferogram to obtain wavelength spectrum for the light this allow u to calculate the mean wavelength and spectral width which fit the expect value base on the light colour and method of generation we also perform wiens displacement law on the tungsten lamp to test it black body behavior we obtain a temperature of 3389±234 k which differs from the state value of 2796 k. this discrepancy be likely due to the inability of the detector to detect infrared light the sensitivity of the detector also generate a lot of noise to reduce the error introduce by this i would repeat the experiment in an isolated room and use a detector which can detect infrared light fig 8. a graph show the wavelength spectrum for a green filter tungsten lamp fit with a gaussian 1 here an unexpected dip can be see,extended,the
152,2ndINT_QFQ712_Redacted,michelson interferometer be construct and use to record interferograms of a white lead a blue lead a tungsten source and a tungsten with a green filter the null point be found to be at -0.86 mm with 0.005 uncertainty the spectrum of different source be construct from the interferograms and the characteristic of the light source and the filter be analyze in this experiment we investigate how the michelson interferometer produce interference fringe and construct one a a spectrometer then the interferometer be use to record interferograms use source with a variety of spectral composition in mathematics principle the interferogram be essentially a fourier transform of the light source so we can describe the spectrum of the source quantitatively use the interferograms a simulation of different light source and their spectrum be developed to compare with the experimental data optical interferometer can be use a spectrometer for the study of detailed line in a spectrum remarkably the basic structure of ligo 's interferometer which develops gravitaional wave observation be very similar to the michelson interferometer 2 the michelson interferometer be invent by albert araham michelson and it be a common configuration for optical interferometry the setup be show in figure .1. the interferometer produce interference fringe by splitting a monochromatic light so that the reflect beam a travel to a movable mirror and the transmit bean b travel to a fix mirror the beam splitter have a partially silver surface and a dielectric plate when the beam be partially reflect at the mirror and brought back together at the detector an interference pattern result the ray diagram from an observer 's perspective be show in fig 2. the path difference between distance travel by a fig 2 the ray diagram from an observer 's perspective 1 and b be t d−d m2 be where the mirror m2 appear to be when the path difference be multiple of m 2 λ where m be odd number the beam interfere constructively when m be even number the beam interfere destructively so we obtain where θ be the angle make by the incoming ray and m be the order of interference this equation show the relation between θ and the order of interference fig 3 formation of interference fringe in the michelson interferometer 3 the nature of the fringe observe by u depends on whether two mirror be properly align the fringe can be interpret a the result of interference between light come from tow virtual image s 1 and s 2 of the original source in fig 3a m1 and m 2 be parallel which mean the mirror be perfectly align the result interference pattern be circle center normal to the mirror it be call haidinger fringe in fig 3.b m1 and m 2 be tilt the cylindrical symmetry be broken m1 and m 2 have interference fringe of hyperbola shape and the overlap of the mirror give straight parallel and equally space fringe near the axis this be call the fizeau fringe fourier transforms decomposes a signal a function of time into frequency that make it up an interferogram temporal be transform to a spectrum spectral through the principle of fourier transform for a single monochromatic wave we observe a sinusoidal fringe which be a delta function in frequency space for two monochromatic wave of distinct frequency the interferogram be the sum of the two sinusoidal fringe with different time period a show in fig 4. at equal arm length m=0 two fringe pattern be exactly in phase a one fringe with longer wavelength move away from that point it will catch up with the other fringe at some point and the two wave will be exactly in phase again that be why a beating pattern appear in the interferogram a show in fig 5. there be a reciprocal relationship between the separation between the null in the interferogram and the separation of the two frequency in the frequency space which be a direct consequence of fourier transform the spectral line shape of a monochromatic light source such a a blue lead be approximately gaussian where v 0 be the mean frequency and σ be the standard deviation accord to fourier theory a gaussian spectral feature lead to a gaussian temporal feature interferogram the reciprocal relationship be demonstrates again a a consequence of fourier theory that a narrow spectral line lead to a wide gaussian interferogram and vice versa a show in fig 6. the coherence length be the propagation distance over which the light wave resembles a sinusoidal 4 it describes the spectral quality of a light source partially speak it measure the distance over which one arm of a michelson interferometer can be scan before the quality becomes poor 1 the relation between the spectral width and the coherence length be give below where ∆v be the spectral width hz of the spectrum and l be the coherence length m the spectral width be associate to the wavelength width 1 where λ be the mean wavelength m of the light source and ∆λ be the width of wavelength m the relation between the full width half maximum fwhm and σ of a gaussian be the σ of a gaussian fit to a interferogram can refer to the coherence length and the σ of a gaussian fit to a spectrum can refer to the spectral width ∆λ which can use to calculate l use equation 3 and 4 the experimental procedure consists of three main part construct an interferometer find the null point and character different light source we construct the interferometer use the arrangement of the michelson interferometer a described previously the set up be show in fig 7. to align the component of the interferometer a green laser be use we firstly fix the position of m1 and put the beam splitter parallel to m1 and at the same height these two component be align when the reflection beam from m1 merge with the beam come out of the beam splitter then repeat the same for m2 and the beam splitter the tilt of m2 be adjust in order to have two spot from the two arm of the interferometer on top of each other about 1 meter away from the beam splitter an interference pattern be observe then a 25mm lens which have a long focal length be put fig 7 the set up of the construct interferometer between source and the beam splitter to enlarge the fringe pattern the stage be move by use the take-data function in the terminal in linux the three parameter be the position of the stage move to the rate of stage movement and the sample size we chose a rate that be not too fast for the oscillation of the stage to disturb the signal or too slow and inefficient the sample size be chosen to be sufficient in represent the data the spectrum be reconstruct by perform fast fourier transforms fft on the interferogram use python they be compare to reference literature to check their accuracy the null point be the point at which t=0 the arm length be exactly the same at the null point we found the null point by use the green laser and the white lead consecutively the closer the stage be to the null point the few number of dark and bright fringe be observe accord to equation 1 a long range of the stage be scan through and we narrow it down to the range where the fringe number be small a the position of the stage approach the null point the fringe disappear into the center a the position of the stage move away from the null point the fringe appear out of the center use this property we found the null point within 0.2 mm the white lead be then use because the white light fringe can only be see at the null point the reason for it be that white lead cover a board range of wavelength and the probability of all the wave be in phase be very small except at the null point the stage be then scan through the reduce length and the null point be found we characterize different light source and filter by take interferograms of a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten white light with a green filter for 0.1mm range around the null point the mean wavelength of each source be calculate by zoom in on the interferogram record the length around 10 wavelength and calculate the mean the assumption be that the distance between sample be constant the coherence length be measure use a combination of method we measure the range of the interferomgram where the signal be sinusoidal alternatively we fit a gaussian function for a spectrum measure the full width half maximum fwhm and calculate the σ of the gaussian from equation 5 and hence obtain the value of coherence length the null point of the interferometer be at -0.860mm with 0.005 uncertainty a show in fig 8 the white light source give a very sharp line at the null point so the uncertainty be very small the spectrum of a white lead a blue lead a white light tungsten and a white light tungsten with a green filter be analyze by fitting a gaussian function to each spectrum the value of fwhm of the gaussian be measure and σ the coherence length l and the spectral width ∆v be calculate use equation 3 4 and 5 these value be only an approximation for u to take data since the formula assumes a gaussian while the actual shape of each source be not the two main source of uncertainty be the alignment of the interferometer and the non-linear movement of the stage the alignment ensures the transmit and reflect beam to be near 100 overlap the non-linear movement would be measure a a displacement which interrupt the amplitude of the signal a well a shift the interferogram the spectrum of the white lead source use fast fourier transform be show in fig 8. the offset which be the background noise be read from the interferogram be 0.88 a.u .. we fig 9 spectrum of the white lead source use fft can see that the spectrum peak at λ 1 =457 nm and λ 2 =577nm λ 1 be in the range of green color wavelength the amplitude be significantly high in the range of λ=520nm to λ=640nm which be in the range of red and green color 5 this indicates that white lead be actually make of three domain color blue red and green which match with theory when we perceive white light it be actually come from a combination of wavelength of blue red and green or blue and yellow 6 so the white light produce by lead be combine red blue and green lead or use a blue lead with a phosphor coat to convert blue light to white light by a process call fluorescence 7 since the amplitude be high in the red wavelength region than the blue wavelength range the light would be perceive a warm white the spectrum of the tungsten white light source be produce use fft with offset 0.65 a.u a show in fig 10 .. the tungsten light source be approximately a black body radiation which can be described use planck 's law a show in fig 11. however the sensitivity of the photodiode in the be only sufficient over the from 400 nm to 1100 nm which be around the visible region 8 the photodiode also have a fig 11 black body radiation at 3000k 9 directional sensitivity characteristic which mean it be more responsive to beam normal to the surface than others so the fft spectrum only show the visible part of a black body radiation and the other part be cut off wien 's displacement law state that where t be the temperature k and λ peak be the maximum wavelength m the temperature of tungsten white light calculate be 3620 ± 50k a green filter be use to transmit a define wavelength band of light while reject other unwanted radiation the mathematical principle be a convolution of a black body radiation and a bound region the green filter be also use to broaden the coherence length of a light source by 37.5 which be due to the reciprocal relationship between ∆λ and coherence length l. the filter we use act a a band-pass filter and have gaussian property with mean wavelength 543.5 ± 2 nm and fwhm 10 ± 2 nm 10 these two graph be symmetric about the centre which demonstrates a direction of the peak of the spectrum associate with the two side of the filter they show the spike be not the result of noise in the signal but very likely to be the manufacture property of the green filter in this experiment we construct a michelson interferometer to take measurement of a variety of light source such a white lead blue lead tungsten white light and tungsten light with a green filter the null point of the interferometer be found to be at -0.860 mm with 0.005 uncertainty the interferogram of light source be reconstruct to spectrum by perform fast fourier transforms on a computer we characterize the light source and filter by measure the spectral width and coherence length and analyze the spectrum the spectrum of the white lead indicates the nature of white light be a combination of red blue and green light the tungsten light source be approximately a black body at temperature= 3620 ± 50 k. the green filter be show to broaden the coherence length by 37.5 and to transmit light in a want wavelength range we also found the filter be not behaving like an ideal gaussian a described but have three peak on the top due to manufacture property,extended,the
153,2ndINT_BMS328_Redacted,this investigation sought to observe some of the property of various light source with the use of a michelson interferometer this interferometer consist of a stepper motor which would change the type of haidinger fringe observe it be essential that the null point be found a this would be the point where reading would be measure from four different light source be use include a white lead a blue lead a tungsten halogen light source and a mercury discharge lamp the white lead produce two clear peak a expect with wavelength of 441nm ± 51.0nm and 563nm ± 123nm the former of these wavelength prove to match the calculate mean wavelength of the blue lead also analyse with a wavelength of 454nm ± 4.00 × 10 −8 m. the tungsten halogen light source be measure both with band pa filter and without the former of these provide lorentzian peak with the yellow filter lie within the range of the mean wavelength measure however the wavelength measure for the green filter do not lie within the bandwidth of the green filter use the measurement take without filter provide a curve that approximately follow that of a black body curve until the infared spectrum where these two line 'diverged due to the limitation of the detector the mercury fft provide two distinct peak with some splitting however the value obtain lay outside of the expect value for the green spectral line and yellow doublet t he first use of the michelson interferometer come in 1887 with the michelson-morley experiment which aim to detect the earth movement through the 'luminiferous ether 1 this configuration of interferometer have go on to be very useful in multiple area of study include the detection of ligo 's detection of gravitational wave in 2015 2 this investigation seek to investigate the composition and property of several light source which include white light from a tungsten and lead source a blue lead and a mercury discharge lamp this can be do by take interferograms of the various light source and use this to generate a fourier transform to determine property of the light source such a spectral width coherence length and peak wavelength this spectral analysis can be accomplish use the michelson interferometer which be another application of interferometry in it most fundamental form the michelson interferometer consists of two arm connect by a beam splitter which split and then recombine the light source which can be either monochromatic or chromatic from the two path to generate a superimpose signal compose of light and dark fringe which can be detect and analyse 3 there be two main type of interference pattern that be commonly produce by this kind of interferometer the first and most important for this investigation be the haidinger fringe which produce line of equal inclination and the frizeau fringe which generate line of equal separation haidinger fringe be more useful a in theory they should produce a more sinusoidal signal for intensity against distance move by one of the mirror on the interferometer in addition the haidinger fringe make it easy to find the null point of the interferometer which be where the path difference between the two path length t be zero there be two factor that affect the production of interference on a michelson interferometer with those be the linear distance between the mirror and the orientation of both mirror if this difference be simply linear and the mirror be perfectly align then haidinger fringe will be generate if however the respective mirror have differ orientation which would imply that the mirror be not perfectly align fizeau fringe be generate which can be see in fig 1. it can be thought of a a consequence of two virtual image interfere with one another separate by a particular distance 'white light be the mixture of all visible wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum at the null point the arm of the interferometer be equal in length and thus constructive interference occurs at all of the compose wavelength of 'white light source and white light will be visible at the detector a one move away from the null point there will be very specific constructive and destructive interference produce a colourful interference pattern a can see in fig 2. however a high order of interference be reach there will be common factor of the order of interference of the various wavelength compose white light which will lead to a match of interference which lead to a disappearance in the interference pattern a a result white light have a short coherence length of about 10µm the two 'white light source use have significant difference in their composition and construction white lead 's can be construct in several way with the most common type compose of a blue or uv lead with phosphor material help to create the white light spectrum on the other hand the stabilise tungsten halogen light source provide a constant black body radiation spectrum that range from 360 to 2600nm 5 this source therefore can be described by where b be the spectral radiance h be plank 's constant k b be the boltzmann constant c be the speed of light ν be the frequency of the em radiation and t be the temperature in kelvin when the interference pattern be detect by the photodiode an interferogram be produce this can take to determine the coherence length of the source which be simply the range over which the interferometer can scan before the resolution of the interferogram becomes too poor to measure and 'white noise be only detect an interferogram like any time dependent signal can be fourier transform to reveal information about the signal the fourier transform of a real time dependent function f t be where g ω be a function of angular frequency for a monochromatic source with infinitely thin spectral width a delta function δ ω will be produce the spectral line generate from a lamp should take the form of an approximate gaussian which can be express a with α be a constant 6 it can be see from fig 3 that the broader the spectral width of a source the thinner the interferogram and thus the shorter the coherence length the spectral width of a source can be calculate without the use of fourier analysis use the formula where ∆v be the spectral width measure in hz and l be the coherence length in meter the spectral width be related to σ for a gaussian for the coherence length this relationship can easily be obtain by measure the fwhm of the coherence length where the fwhm be the full width at half maximum for the interferogram and σ be the standard deviation of the same distribution which be equivalent to the spectral width of the source fig 3. illustration show a spectrum for a give source and their respective interferograms 7 from this the wavelength can be calculate without fourier analysis to be where c be the speed of light in a vacuum λ be the mean wavelength and ∆λ be the difference in wavelength across the spectrum fig 4 show a basic set up for the type of interferometer use in this investigation this type of interferometer consists of 5 main component the first of these be the source which can be mount inside a collimation package or can be place inside the v-block clamp this then lead to the cube beam splitter in which one of the side be coat in a reflective dielectric material which allows the light to be split and then recombine the two mirror have different system of movement which both have their u m 2 help with the alignment of the interferometer by provide two degree of freedom in order to generate the desire haidinger fringe mirror m 1 do not have this type of movement and so keep the fringe at a constant inclination the detector provide have an amplifier which be useful when certain light source have a low intensity than others the first procedure that have to be carry out be the alignment of the interferometer use a collimate green laser this involve align both of the laser spot so that they be directly over one another on the output arm this alignment can be make well by extend the distance of the output arm perfectly overlap the two light spot give a explain previously haidinger interference after the alignment process the null point have to be found this would be the point around which all interferograms would be take initially the difference in distance between the two orthogonal interferometer arm t be large the distance t be then reduce which cause the fringe pattern to move inwards towards the centre of the haidinger interference pattern a t → 0 the fringe become wider until only the central fringe be visible if t → −∞ the fringe move outwards until the central fringe becomes too small to measure 9 this provide a framework to find the null point due to the short coherence length of white light this be use to fine tune the location after the collimate laser have found it to the near 0.1mm after this the detector could be put in place and a series of measurement could take place it be important to scan over one coherence length to provide a complete spectral measurement whilst also scan with an appropriate resolution for the interferogram to be useful iv result and analysis fig 5 show an interferogram for a white lead scan across the entirety of the coherence length it be clear to see that this interferogram be not purely compose of a continuous distribution of wavelength due to some inflection in the interferogram like that see at -0.918. the approximate coherence length obtain from fig be 11µm ±1.84µm after the interferogram of the lead have be take a fourier transform could be perform a see if fig 6. two peak can clearly be see with these have peak wavelength of 441nm ± 51.0nm and 563nm ± 123nm for the first peak from the left and the peak furthest to the right respectively the significance of this result will be realise when the blue lead interferogram and fft be analyse the fft generate from this in fig 8 show a very well define peak with a spectral width of if 4 be use 5.97×10 12 hz±6.99×10 11 hz this lorenzian shape coheres to the concept of natural and doppler broadening 10 the peak wavelength obtain from this fft be 454nm ± 4.00 × 10 −8 m. the above result be significant due to the way in which the white lead 's be construct for this experiment the small of the two wavelength found in fig 6 have an associate error that lie within the range of the wavelength found from the fft of a blue lead a be expect 9 show two fft for a tungsten halogen light source with either a green or yellow filter affixed onto the light source once again similar to the blue lead the peak be lorentzian in character both peak be split in similar way at their top this make find λ peak especially challenge these two peak be found to be 530nm ± 3.00 × 10 −8 m for the green filter and 572nm ± 3.50 × 10 8 m for the yellow filter the filter use for this fft be band pa filter which would explain why there discontinuity either side of the peak these filter have central wavelength of 580nm±2nm for the yellow filter and 543.5nm ± 2nm for the green filter use 11 the range of the yellow filter measurement indeed lie within this range however the peak wavelength measure for the green filter do not lie within this range one explanation could be the fact that the green filter cause a large drop in intensity which would lead to a great uncertainty in the signal detect by the photodiode for the tungsten source without a filter a narrow interferogram be produce with a coherence length of 14µm ± 2.83. a this be a slightly large coherence length than for the white lead one would expect a very slightly narrower fft fig 11 show both the fft of the interferogram in fig 10 and the theoretical black body curve use both 1 and wein 's displacement law simply from observation the first portion of the black body curve in the ultraviolet spectrum move in some way like the signal they both peak a expect however when λ λ peak the two curve 'diverge and then recombine this be down to the range a the photodiode can not detect em in the infared the final light source analyse be a mercury discharge lamp the emission spectrum of a mercury lamp include a green line of wavelength 546.074nm and a yellow doublet of 576.959nm and 579.065nm 12 fig 12 show two distinct peak with well define splitting on both peak these peak however appear to be shorter wavelength than expect with the high two peak have wavelength of 540nm ± 50nm and 526nm ± 45nm with this large calculate error this indeed could be the yellow doublet however the small of the peak with a wavelength of 526nm ± 34nm this clearly be not the green line consider the success of the previous measurement some random error must have occur or the equipment be use in such a way to find a new fault there be a multitude of different explanation that could diagnose some of the problem face with this investigation and help to explain why some measurement like that of the tungsten with the green filter and the mercury discharge lamp be unsuccessfully take one possible explanation for any such problem be the concept of motor backlash backlash be when a motor loses motion which a a result lead to a discrepancy between the command position the position displayed on the computer and the actual position of the motor 13 other way of improve the result obtain would come from increase the sample size of some of our measurement a for some interferograms use like the one obtain for the green and yellow filter the interferogram be not smooth and sinusoidal like what be expect this may have produce smoother peak without asymmetry the information that be gain from the interferograms obtain through the use of a michelson interferometer prove for the most part to be very useful which render this experiment a success the interferograms for the lead 's measure prove to be successful and generate correct value tungsten prove to also be successful produce encourage fft 's the error encounter be most likely down to the mechanical shortcoming of the motor and it lack of consistency especially at the begin and end of the motor cycle,deep,exp
154,2ndINT_QPL350_Redacted,the main object of this experiment be to analyse the spectrum of different light source by measure the interferogram which could be fourier transform to spectrum in this experiment the characteristic of the green laser white lead blue lead and tungsten lamp be investigate the spectrum of those different light source be plot a well a calculate the coherent length and spectral width for each of those light source by fitting a gaussian function to the fourier-transformed interferogram some improvement be discus at the end of the lab report i nterferometry be a strong and precise technique by take advantage of the interference phenomenon of wave normally electromagnetic wave interferometer be usually use to measure small displacement refractive index and other precise measurement the most famous application of interferometry be the discovery of gravitational wave in ligo use a fabryprot interferometer which be basically a michelson interferometer the configuration of the interferometer use in this experiment be the michelson interferometer the light after reflection by the mirror travel the opposite direction compare to the light before but with the same path the path be separate in the diagram be for clear illustration this graph be reproduce from 1 interference be a very common phenomenon when two wave of the same frequency superpose base on the principle of superposition the superposition principle will be discus in later section in this experiment we measure the interferogram of many different type of light source include green laser white lead blue lead white tungsten bulb itself and tungsten bulb with green and yellow filter the green laser be monochromatic since in theory it consists of only one frequency of light other light source investigate in this experiment generate light which consists of a range of frequency after fourier transformation the interferogram will be transform into a spectrum in this report the characteristic of the interferogram and spectrum of all the aforementioned light source be discus both quantitatively and qualitatively such a the mean wavelength coherent length spectral width and shape of interferogram around the null point in this section the theoretical and mathematical background of the interference michelson interferometer fourier transform be introduce when two wave of the same frequency meet they will superpose accord to the superposition principle in other word the net amplitude of the resultant wave form at one point be the sum of the amplitude of the two individual wave at that point when two wave be in phase constructive interference occurs result in bright fringe whereas destructive interference occurs when two wave be out of phase create dark fringe the type of fringe produce by a michelson interferometer be determine by the set up of the apparatus for example the position of the mirror to understand this imagine the two mirror be place a show in figure 1 at exactly right angle to each other for convenient calculation and simple illustration the setup mention could be consider a the same in the diagram a of figure 2. the relationship between the separation t and the wavelength λ of the incident could be described by the equation where m be the order of interference and refractive index be assume to be 1. due to the cylindrical symmetry of the case in figure 3b haidinger fringe will be produce if the incident light be monochromatic when one of the mirror be tilt a show in figure 2b the cylindrical symmetry be broken create fizeau fringe identify the fringe form be of great importance in the alignment of the mirror and the beam splitter a michelson spectrometer consists of five main part a light source two mirror a beam splitter and a detector or screen a show in figure 1. monochromatic wave be emit from the light source laser and split into two beam due to the beam splitter the reflect beam travel to mirror 1 and reflect back superpose with the beam pas through the beam splitter and refle cted by mirror 2. after superposition the resultant light beam be project on the screen or detector create interference fringe when the path distance l1 and l2 be of the same distance constructive interference occurs conversely if there be exactly λ 2 path difference between l1 and l2 there be no light on the detector due to destructive interference therefore move either mirror one or mirror two by a fraction of the wavelength will influence the fringe produce on the screen however the dielectric plate on the beam splitter introduces a phase shift for one of the split beam which mean that the destructive interference occurs when two path be of the same length an interferogram can be plot by measure the intensity of the light project on the detector and the position of one the mirror the interferogram can be use to determine the coherent length of the light source and after fourier transform it becomes a spectrum which be useful in the analysis of the characteristic of the light source such a the spectral width and the mean wavelength normally the fourier transform of a function refers to the transformation of a function f t in the time domain to a new function g w in the frequency domain a define in equation 2. conversely the inverse fourier transform can transform a function in the frequency domain to the time domain use equation 3. the fourier transform of a gaussian function could be solve by integrate by part this give a form of the gaussian function in the frequency domain however fast fourier transform fft be use in this experiment which be more efficient and convenient for the computer to calculate the fft base on discrete fourier transform transforms a sample of equallyspaced sample of function delta function in this case to a same-length sequence of equally-spaced sample of complex function of frequency 4 the fouriertransformed gaussian function can be use to describe the result from fft therefore it be possible to fourier transform the interferogram in time domain to retrieve a spectrum with it frequency composition a show in figure 4. a gaussian function could be fit to the spectrum in figure 4b the spectral width could be consider a the σ in the gaussian function and can be calculate by the fwhm full width at half maximum of the fit gaussian use equation 6. the spectral width calculate be in meter which could be convert to hertz with the equation where c be the speed of light and λ be the centre wavelength then the coherent length l could be found use the formula also it be possible to measure the coherent length from the interferogram and calculate the spectral width use equation 8. for this experiment the apparatus setup be the same a the michelson interferometer in figure 1. the position of the mirror 1 be at a fix distance from the beam splitter and mirror 2 be carry by an electric motor the mirror1 be adjust so that it be approximately perpendicular to mirror 2 and parallel to the side of the cubic-shaped beam splitter that it face the alignment could be checked by align two beam of a green laser to a screen use two plano-convex lens to convert the light beam to an extend source if haidinger fringe be produce then the apparatus be correctly align the plano-convex lens be only use for the green laser when try to align for other light source such a the white lead and blue lead a diffuser be use to acquire a more spread uniform light source what 's more the interferometer and light source be place inside a black box to minimize the noise from other light source in the laboratory all of the measurement be take by a computer the data of the intensity of light be collect by a photodiode detector the parameter that be adjustable be the position of the mirror carry by the motor speed of the motor and the frequency to take the data point the default frequency be at 50 hz during the lab cycle 3 my partner and i obtain the interferograms for the green laser white lead blue lead tungsten bulb and tungsten bulb with green and yellow filter all of the interferograms be fourier-transformed to spectrum to proceed far analysis there be a slight misalignment for all of the measurement which cause asymmetry in the interferogram plot this be solve by subtract the diagonal line from the original data the data use to proceed fft be the modify data the spectral width of the green laser spectrum be calculate to be 1.98±0.07 × 10 13 hz which in term of meter be 1.83±0.06 × 10 −8 m. the mean peak wavelength be found to be 527±17 nm and the coherent length be 2.42±0.09 µm in theory the green laser beam be monochromatic which mean that it contains only one frequency of light and produce only one peak in the fourier-transformed spectrum however in the spectrum show in figure 5 there be several peak instead of one peak also in the interferogram of the green laser beating appear which mean that the laser provide be not a monochromatic a we think this be due to the limitation of the uncertainty principle a light source can never be perfectly monochromatic despite the laser be not perfectly monochromatic the fairly narrow spectral width compare to other light source make it a good source to generate sharp and clear interference pattern for the alignment a show in figure 6. fig 6 green laser interference pattern this figure be take after proper alignment a show in the figure the fringe form be concentric circle which agrees to our theory it could be see from the figure that the brightness of top right fringe be high than that of the bottom left fringe this be due to slightly misalignment of the mirror more detailed information will be discus in the error analysis section the mean peak measure for the blue lead be 466±14 nm with a spectral width of 12.5±1.9 nm and the coherent length be found to be 1182±17 nm this be within the range of the blue light which be from 400 nm to 495 nm the main mean peak for fit gaussian of the spectrum of the white lead be at 582±16 nm with an uncertainty of nm moreover a see from figure 7 there be also a peak on the white lead spectrum at 456 nm with an uncertainty of nm which be also within the blue light range the cause of this unexpected peak on the white lead spectrum be the manufacture of the white lead blue red and green lead be the three most common lead use in our daily life the white lead use in the experiment be manufacture base on a blue lead cover with fluorescent material that illuminate a variety of light that combine together to form white light the peak in the blue light region be due to the blue lead inside the white lead the spectral width of the white lead be 61.2±7.3 nm which in the frequency spectrum be 5.42±0.64 × 10 12 hz the coherent length of the white lead be 881±11 nm compare the gaussian function g in the time domain with the gaussian function g equation 4 and equation 5 it be clear that a wide spectral line in the spectrum result in a narrower interferogram the result from the experiment for blue and white lead be consistent with the theoretical prediction what 's more the emission spectrum of both blue lead and white lead be within the visible optical range for human eye which mean that most of the energy be use to generate visible light this characteristic of the lead make them more efficient illuminate tool compare to the traditional incandescent light bulb a see from the spectrum of the white tungsten lamp the majority of the frequency be locate in the infrared region with some relatively small peak in the visible spectrum after fitting with a gaussian function around the main peak it be found that the mean peak wavelength be at 963±28 nm with a spectral width of 191±6 nm the coherent length be calculate to be 910±26 nm the vast amount of emission of infrared make the tungsten bulb a much less efficient way of illumination most of the energy be transfer to the creation of infrared which could cause heating effect around the surroundings therefore tungsten bulb a well a other type of incandescent light bulb be good heating source moreover the tungsten bulb could be approximate to a black body with a peak emission at 963±28 nm use wiens displacement law the temperature of the tungsten bulb be calculate to be 3008±89 k. when place behind a green filter the spectral width be calculate to be 13.1±1 nm with a peak at 509±14 nm when replace by a yellow filter the peak shit to 544±15 nm with a spectral width of 15±1 nm the coherent length for the green and yellow filter be calculate to be 3.1±0.1 µm and 3.2±0.1 µm respectively this prof that the filter be good band-pass filter with very small bandwidth it be clear from figure 8 that the filter wave be in the visible spectrum but with relatively small intensity compare to the infrared emission from the white tungsten lamp the main error in the experiment be from misalignment which cause asymmetry in the interferogram when do fft to the asymmetric interferogram the mean wavelength of the light source may shift compare to the situation when the apparatus be perfectly align we found it difficult to make perfect alignment during the experiment after try for a multiple of time the mirror carry by the electric motor be fix in position and could not be adjust this mirror may not be perpendicular to the ground or it may tilt slightly which could be a source of misalignment there be speck of dust on the surface of the beam splitter which could also influence the alignment another source of error be the fast fourier transform the fft be base on the discrete fourier analysis which be only valid for equally-spaced discrete value from the data collect by the computer we found that the electric motor do not move with a constant interval this could cause a shift of peak value and a change in spectral width for the spectrum transform by fft there be also an uncertainty in the function fitting what 's more although place in a black box there could be a leak of noise from other light source in the laboratory however this effect be too small compare to the other two error source thus this effect could be neglect there be several improvement that we could make for this experiment the default sample frequency of the detector be 50 hz this mean that to take data for a long range of distance it could take hour to proceed we could have change this frequency during the experiment to proceed the experiment more efficiently a long a the sample rate be within the nyquist frequency beyond the nyquist frequency aliasing effect could occur result in an incorrect interferogram moreover multiple interferograms of the same light source could have be take to get more accurate result during the measurement of the tungsten lamp the bulb wire be heat to a high temperature the tungsten lamp could have be switch off and cool between successive measurement my partner and i successfully construct a spectrometer use a michelson interferometer and a computer do fft after obtain proper interferograms for the green laser the white lead the blue lead the tungsten bulb and the same tungsten bulb with green and yellow filter we do fourier analysis to the interferograms to get their correspond spectrum by fitting gaussian function to the spectrum of those light source we calculate the spectral width the mean wavelength and the coherent length for each of those source then we analyze their function with the characteristic we get from their spectrum lead be energy-saving and efficient light source which could be use for illumination tungsten bulb be good heating source due to the vast emission in the infrared spectrum the yellow and green filter be bandwidth filter that only allows a very narrow range of frequency of light pa through in the end the error source and improvement be discus,extended,bal
155,2ndINT_WEM893_Redacted,abstract-when light be pas through a michelson interferometer light from the two arm interferes with each other due to a phase change along their respective path the resultant pattern be refer to a an interferogram in this lab report we investigate the interferograms for different source of light spectrum with different filter and use them to characterise the source and filter we investigate an unexpected result when apply the filter to a tungsten lamp certain wavelength be unexpectedly miss from the detect beam we explore factor such a dust in the lens alter which wavelength of light be be absorbed to explain this discrepancy t he michelson interferometer be invent in 1887 by albert michelson to determine the effect of the earth 's rotation on the speed of light 1 it be use in the famous michelson-morley experiment to search for the presence of the luminiferous aether through which light be believe to travel through when light from a source be pas through the interferometer it be split into two arm via a beam splitter light from these two arm be then reflect back onto the beam splitter when these beam be focus onto each other they produce an interference pattern call an interferogram it be expect that light travel in the direction of the earth 's rotation would travel faster than light travel perpendicular 2 which would show in the interferogram the result of the experiment be to disprove the existence of any such aether which would go on to be the basis of einstein 's second postulate of special relativity we have built a michelson interferometer to investigate several light source the aim of this report be to determine which wavelength be present in the spectrum of these source base on the interferograms produce and to investigate discrepancy between the interferograms produce and the expect result the beam splitter in an interferometer split incident light onto two arm a and b. light on arm a be reflect off the partially silver mirror while light on arm b be transmit light on path a and b be then reflect off mirror m1 and m2 respectively and be both detect at the detector a schematic of an interferometer be give in fig 1. the dielectric plate in the beam splitter cause a phase change in one arm of light therefore there be destructive interference incident at the detector when the path difference between the two arm be equal to mλ where m be an integer and λ be the wavelength of the light when an extend light source be use light appear to be both reflect and transmit at m2 fig 2. show the path difference between light come from arm a and b. this path difference be equal to 2tcos θ where t be the separation between m1 and m2 and θ be the angle between the incident ray and the normal to m1 a proof of this be give in appendix 1. therefore we get for destructive interference one light source may contain several different frequency of light the line width of the spectrum of light emit have an effect on the result interferogram consider a light source contain two frequency ω 1 and ω 2 where the amplitude be f t we can define such that therefore the amplitude of the wave at some time t can be described by the result pattern show fast oscillation with time period t f ast modulate by a slow frequency with time period t slow a demonstrate by fig 3. this beating pattern be dependent on the difference in frequency therefore the closer the two frequency the far the separation between the node of the beating pattern this can be extend to a source with a spectrum of frequency the narrower the spectral width the wider the beating pattern the amplitude of a beating pattern decrease with time a the phase difference of the interfere wave change this result in the interferogram look like a beating waveform envelop by a gaussian distribution from an interferogram one can determine property of the light source we will measure the peak wavelength present and the spectral width of each source we will take a fourier transform of each wave which will decompose the interferogram into the wavelength present the temporal coherence of a source refers to the average correlation between the interference pattern from one point in time to another and be related to the spectral width of the source 4 we define the coherence length l to be where c be the speed of light and τ be the coherence time the coherence time be equal to the change in time between the two point of the interference pattern ∆t therefore where ∆υ be the spectral width or the range of frequency combine equation 8 and 10 give we will take the coherence length of each source to be the full width half maximum fwhm of the gaussian envelope the equation for the fwhm be where σ be the standard deviation of the gaussian thus we can use the fwhm to find the spectral width by combine equation 11 and 12 an image of our interferometer be show in fig 4. we use a 100mm lens to focus light from a laser source onto the beam splitter to ensure the laser beam be parallel to the work surface we position a magnetic ruler at one end of the plastic tube that the laser be held in and measure it height at eye level we do the same for the other end of the tube and adjust the beam splitter to ensure these height be equal we then fix the stand hold m1 and m2 so that they be both perpendicular and equidistant from the beam splitter we rotate the beam splitter so that the beam be focus at the centre of m2 with a 25mm lens we focus the outgo beam onto a black card near the detector to make the beam clearer to see we then adjust m1 so that the two beam from arm a and b be focus at the same point result in circular haidinger fringe due to the cylindrical symmetry of the system we use a laser during the alignment process a it be more focus than the lead or tungsten source this allow u to achieve a precise alignment before we take data use other source the null point be the point at which t 0 m2 appear to be at m1 here wave from both arm of the interferometer be in phase result in a peak in amplitude we wish to take data close to the null point a this be where the beating pattern and overall gaussian be most clear to determine what range the null point be in we use equation 1 for a give fringe m be fix a we approach the null point t tends to zero therefore co θ must be increase so θ must be decrease therefore a m2 move toward the null point the haidinger fringe will appear to move inwards and vice versa this method allow u to narrow down the width of the range the null point be in to less than 1mm the nyquist sample theorem state that the sample frequency for a signal should be at least twice the high frequency contain in the signal to avoid aliasing 5 our simulation for the interference of white light show that the small wavelength present in the interferogram have an order of magnitude of 10 −6 m. we know that the detector by default sample at a frequency of 50hz we want the distance between sample to be 100 time small than the small wavelength present in the interferogram to achieve a good image base on this we set the motor speed to a maximum of 0.001mms −1 we take data for a white and a blue lead and a white light tungsten source with a green and a yellow filter we take data for the 1mm range we determine the null point to be in make sure that when we be take data that the work bench be not disturbed a the mirror be sensitive to vibration though the bench to minimise noise in the signal due to background light we conduct the experiment with the apparatus in a black box iv result and error analysis fig 5. show the characteristic of each light source the mean wavelength be calculate by zoom in on the peak wavelength present in the fourier transform in the case that there several wavelength peak the average of these peak be take when zoom in on the fourier transform to find the peak the plot appear to be uniform over a 20nm range therefore an error of 10nm be estimate for the measurement of the peak λ peak in the case that a light source give more than one peak the error be calculate use where n be the number of peak present fig 6. and fig 7. show the interferogram for the blue lead and it fourier transform respectively the third column of fig 5. refers to the standard deviation of the gaussian envelope fit to the interference pattern this fit be make use the curvefit function in the python module scipy.optimize data be selectively filter from the interferogram such that the gaussian be fit only the top curve a demonstrate by fig 8. the curvefit function return a matrix of the fit parameter include the standard deviation of the distribution a well a it associate error the coherence length be calculate from the standard deviation use equation 12 therefore the error on the fit parameter propagates to the error of the coherence length h therefore the spectral width be then calculate use equation 13 the result show that for the white light source the spectral width be significantly large than those of source that only emit one colour of light the theory justifies this a white light contains the entire spectrum of visible light so contains more frequency our result far corroborate the theory a the coherence length of the white light source be up to 100 time small than those for other source this demonstrates the reciprocal relationship between t slow and the range of frequency in a source demonstrate by equation 7 when analyse the effect of add a filter to the tungsten lamp we expect to see that the spectral width of the interferogram be narrower a we be select few frequency for the yellow and green filter we expect to see peak at 580 ± 10nm 6 and 543.5 ± 10nm 7 respectively a these be the quote bandpass range from the manufacturer while the result do fall in line with these prediction the fourier transforms show that there be several peak wavelength present instead of the expect one this be show in fig 11. and fig 12. when explore explanation for this result our initial guess be that the lens be scratch thus cause random error however the shape of the graph be similar to each other the likelihood of this happen a a result of scratch on the lens be small a they would have to both be scratch in the same way another theory be that the filter be perform a expect but the detector be less sensitive to certain wavelength thus cause the decrease in amplitude in the middle of the fourier transforms fig 11. be a plot of the relative sensitivity of the detector with increase wavelength of light provide by the manufacturer 8 we can see that the sensitivity of the detector increase with increase wavelength the effect of this would be to increase the amplitude of longer wavelength however this still do not explain the dip in our fourier transform our final theory be that there be some dust on the inside of the lens absorb certain wavelength a study publish in 2017 by atmospheric chemistry and physic test the mass absorption efficiency mae of different sample of mineral dust in 2 different category particle with with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10.6µm and particle with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5µm these group be denote p m 10.6 and p m 2.5 respectively 9 the mae be a measure of the rate of absorption of radiation it be found that regardless of the aerodynamic diameter of dust particle the mae decrease with increase wavelength fig 14. show that the mae for mineral dust be large for wavelength in the range 300nm to 600nm the dip in our fourier transforms for the green and yellow filter occur at around 540nm and 580nm respectively which fall into this range therefore if dust of similar physical property be present in the filter it be possible that it would cause the dip in our fourier transform the aerodynamic diameter of household dust particle range from 18µm to 95µm 10 which include the diameter of mineral dust test in the study these dust account for approximately 40 of emit aerosol mass per year on a global scale 9 therefore it be not unreasonable to hypothesize that some layer of dust be present in the filter thus cause the discrepancy in our result an interferometer be use to analyse 3 different light source a blue lead a white lead and a tungsten lamp the spectral width of these source be found to be 17.8ghz 63.2ghz and 61.3ghz respectively the light source with narrower spectral width have longer coherence length a expect when apply a green or yellow bandpass filter to the tungsten lamp the spectral width decrease to 2.7ghz and 2.5ghz respectively a fourier transform of the interferograms produce by use the filter show that certain wavelength be unexpectedly remove by the filter several factor could explain this such a the effect of a non uniform sensitivity from the detector and the effect of dust particle inside the filter the path difference between the two beam of light be equal to the length qrs minus the length qp the length x be therefore the length qrs be equal to the length z be where substitute equation 17 into equation 20 give the path difference d be therefore

156,2ndINT_WSY182_Redacted,an investigation be undertaken with the aim of demonstrate the use of a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer to analyse the composition of light use fourier analysis a variety of light source be analyse and compare white lead tungsten white light with and without filter and blue lead the observation make agree well with the prediction from optic theory and the method be show to be accurate and precise interferometry be a technique in which wave be superpose and the result interference be analyse to make physical deduction spectrometry be a technique use to separate and measure the spectral component of a physical phenomenon usually light interferometry and spectrometry be both essential component of every physicist toolbox and they be use every day in a wide range of experiment in this investigation a simple michelson interferometer and a computer with analysis software be use in conjuction a a spectrometer to analyse the spectral component of a variety of light source white lead blue lead and filtered/unfiltered tungsten light the principle of superposition of light state that when two or more em wave interact the result wave function be equal to the sum of the individual wave 2 this can lead to interference between the two wave and this interference depends on phase difference between the two wave if in phase then constructive interference occurs and the result amplitude be a maximum conversely in anti-phase destructive interference occurs and the amplitude of the result wave be a minimum hence when two wave superpose they form interference pattern with series of bright and dark band call interference fringe these interference fringe encode information about the light source and hence can be use to deduce physical property of the system in a michelson interferometer one light source be split into two perpendicular beam vary the length of these beam varies the difference in path length between the two beam when they be recombine it be therefore possible to manipulate the interference pattern by vary the length of one of the interferometer arm then measure how interference change with vary path length allows the use of fourier analysis to determine the frequency of light present the set up use in this experiment consists of a basic michelson interferometer a light source be direct towards a beam splitter which split the source into two perpendicular beam path a path b. the two beam then travel out from the beam splitter and be reflect by mirror which be held perpendicular to the beam such that they be reflect directly backwards the two path be then recombine and produce an interference pattern which be measure by the detector a show in figure 1. it be important to ensure that both mirror be perpendicular to the light beam so that the interference observe consist of circular heidinger fringe like that on the cover of this report 1 to do this a green laser source be use and each mirror be alligned independently follow by allignment of the combine beam an image of the alligned apparatus can be see in figure 2. the detector measure intensity of light receive at a sample frequency of 50hz by move mirror a use the stage the length of path a be change relative to path b. this result in a change of the interference pattern and hence a change in the measure intensity the null point be a term use to describe the configuration of the equipment in which path a and path b be of equal length this be important a the interest interference effect happen about the null point and the effect decrease a we move away from the null point to take data mirror a be move very slowly about the null point whilst mirror b remains fix the position of mirror a and the intensity of light be both record once every 0.02s this data can then be plot into an interferogram to show the observe fringe the interferogram can then be fourier transform from position space to frequency space to reveal the frequency of light present in the original source this part be essential and be what completes a spectrometer rather than just an interferometer through early observation it be found that very short distance between measurement result in noisy data this be due to the imprecision of the move stage over distance on the nanometer scale the stage would slip at these scale and hence data would contain a lot of noise the detector have a fix sample rate of 50hz and hence to account for this measurement need to be take at high speed a minimum speed of 0.001mm/s be decide on for proceed measurement correspond to a minimum distance between sample of 20nm this be found to be a good balance between detail and speed such a to maximise the smoothness of the measure interferograms whilst retain a much detail a possible before compare different light source use this set up it be important to first find the null point this be first do with a green laser light source a quick check for the direction of fringe movement at different position allow the location of the null point to be measure between −5.9mm and −5.98mm since either side of the null point the fringe would move in opposite direction to locate the null point more precisely a light source with a small coherence length be need a this result in a very narrow interferogram the green laser be replace by a white lead which should have a wide spectrum and hence a narrow interferogram data be take between −5.9mm and −5.98mm and the measure interferogram can be see in figure 3. to measure the null point a accurately a possible a gaussian envelope be fit to the absolute intensity profile of the white lead the signal level from the normalise interferogram be square and root to give a positive 'spike this can be see in figure 4. the gaussian fit be not perfect and a superposition of gaussians or an approximation to a dirac delta function might be more appropriate to fit the data however for the purpose of this investigation the precision of the gaussian fit be adequate the null point be found to be at a position of x −5.8964 ± 0.0005mm measurement that follow be all take through a narrow band of position around this null point to save time the interferogram of the white lead be discus in the previous section in order to convert this into a spectrum of wavelength a fast fourier transform fft be take and the wavelength profile be plot on the nanometer scale the measure spectrum can be see in figure 5 a expect the white lead produce a wide band of wavelength from around 400nm to 800nm cover the entire visible spectrum and reach into the infrared region a gaussian fit of the spectrum give a mean wavelength of λ 602 ± 66nm this high error of 11 be likely due to the misuse of the gaussian approximation of the data a can be see in figure 5 there be in fact two measure peak one at 460nm and one at 600nm the leftmost peak be likely due to background light from an external light source a the light block lid be not fit during the take of this data some superposition of gaussians be likely more appropriate however for the purpose of comparison in this investigation the gaussian approximation be enough give an idea of the width and intensity of the emission spectrum the next source to be analyse be white light from a thorlabs sls201l tungsten light source a with the white lead in the previous section a narrow wavepacket be expect due to the broad emission profile of the tungsten source a total of 1200 measurement be take about the nullpoint between −5.908mm and −5.884mm the measure interferogram can be see in figure 6. a before an fft be take to convert the interferogram into a measure spectrum the measure spectrum can be see in figure 7. a gaussian approximation yield a mean wavelength of λ 870±130nm this be wider than the white lead profile and also center on a much high wavelength outside of the visible spectrum upon inspection of the datasheet for the tungsten source 3 it be clear that there be some limitation introduce by the detector the emission profile for the tungsten source should reach all the way into high wavelength of 2600nm but the measure profile only reach up to around 1200nm figure 8 show the measure spectrum plot alongside the expect emission spectrum give by thorlabs the detector use consist of a very small aperture hence high wavelength of light particularly those beyond 1200nm could not be detect the measure spectrum be only a partial one and a detector with a large aperture would be require to measure high wavelength and reconstruct the full spectrum nevertheless the detector do pick up on visible wavelength between 400nm and 700nm and hence the tungsten source be suitable in order to test the effect of visible light filter a thorlabs fl543.5-10 green filter be fit to the tungsten light source such that light would pa through the filter before enter the interferometer the purpose of a filter be to absorb most wavelength of light and transmit only a narrow band of light in the green region of the visible spectrum hence the measure spectrum should consist of a tight band of green wavelength a before measurement be take about the null point a total of 3600 sample between −5.93mm and −5.858nm be take with the stage move at a speed of 20nm/s the measure interferogram can be see in figure 9 compare to both the white lead and the tungsten source the interferogram of the green light be very broad with first order interference fringe span from −0.015mm to 0.015mm relative to the null point this be over 7 time wider than the interferograms of the white lead and the tungsten source both of which span from −0.002mm to 0.002mm relative to the null point a fourier transform of the wide interferogram should result in a very narrow band of wavelength be present in the measure spectrum which be exactly what be expect for an optical filter figure 10 show the measure spectrum of tungsten light through the green filter accord to the data sheet the wavelength transmit by the green filter 4 be 543.5 ± 2nm the gaussian approximation give a mean wavelength of λ 540 ± 30nm this show u that the spectrometer be very accurate differ from the expect value by only 0.65 the spectrometer be also precise with an uncertainty on this measurement of just 5.6 the green filter be then replace by a thorlabs fb580-10 yellow filter a before a very narrow band of wavelength be expect in the yellow region of the visible spectrum a total of 3600 measurement be take between −5.93mm and −5.858mm and the firstorder interference band can be see in figure 11. the width of the yellow interferogram be roughly the same a that of the green filter this be a expect give that both filter be make by the same manufacturer an fft be take a before and the result spectrum can be see in figure 12. the mean wavelength through gaussian approximation be found to be λ 576 ± 37nm accord to the datasheet 5 the yellow filter should transmit wavelength of λ 580 ± 2nm which once again show that the spectrometry method be use be both precise and accurate compare the yellow spectrum against the green spectrum in figure 10 it can be see that whilst the width be similar the intensity of yellow light measure be much great than that of green light this make sense refer back to figure 7 reveals that the yellow light center at 570nm be closer to the center of the tungsten emission profile and hence should have great intensity for completeness a truopto osub5111p blue lead be fit in the interferometer and it light be analyse and compare to the filter figure 13 show the measure interferogram a one would expect the observe interferogram be wider than both the white lead and the tungsten source however it be actually narrower than both the green and yellow filter light a narrower interferogram corresponds to a wider wavelength band suggest that filter may be a well route at generate monochromatic light than lead 's it could also just mean that the precision standard follow by truopto for their lead 's be less than the standard held by thorlabs for their filter figure 14 show the measure spectrum of the blue lead the mean wavelength be estimate to be λ 467 ± 17nm once again this be accurate and precise compare to the expect wavelength of 470±5nm give in the lead 's datasheet 6 this be actually the best fit of all the light source discus with a tiny percentage uncertainty of just 1.1 suggest that although the lead produce a wider band of wavelength it have less irregularity and imperfection than the filter the maximum amplitude of the receive blue lead signal be ∼ 280 000 figure 13 whilst the max amplitude of the green and yellow light be just ∼ 595 figure 9 and ∼ 650 figure 11 respectively a brighter light source mean that fluctuation introduce by the detector be less significant than for the dim light source and hence the precision of the spectrometer be increase lead 's may therefore still be the well option for generate monochromatic light the large source of error in this experiment be the error introduce by the move stage a discus in section 4.1 the stage would slip and introduce noise in position measurement this effect be greatly reduce by increase the distance between measurement however the error be not remove entirely the fft require the assumption that data point be evenly space in position space and due to the slip of the stage this be not entirely valid to reduce the error far it may be sensible to write error correction code which group data point into evenly space 'bins provide a reasonable amount of data point remain this would decrease the noise in the fft and hence high precision spectrum could be obtain a far source of error in the experiment be cause by slight misalignment of the apparatus a can be see in both figure 3 and figure 6 there be a negative skew in the the measure data due to misalignement of the two light beam which inevitably cause an asymmetry in the final spectrum it may be sensible to conduct this experiment on a large optical bench increase the length of the interferometer arm would enhance the effect of misalignment which may not be obvious on a small set of apparatus those misalignment would then be fix before any data be take a far improvement could be make by increase the aperture of the detector use a wider aperture would mean that high wavelength photon could be detect deeper into the infrared region of the spectrum a discus in section 4.4 this would allow more comprehensive emission spectrum to be obtain a wider aperture also mean that a great total number of photon would be detect and hence the brightness of the receive signal would be great a discus in section 4.7 this would reduce the error on signal measurement and hence the uncertainty on the measure spectrum even far to summarise this investigation demonstrate a michelson interferometer pair with a computer and data analysis software a a spectrometer this spectrometer be use to analyse and compare a variety of different light source and the observation match well with prediction the method outline be clearly powerful with result that be both accurate and precise nevertheless it have it downside and small adjustment could be make to far improve the quality of the experiment,deep,exp
157,2ndINT_OQP549_Redacted,in the experiment present a michelson interferometer be use to obtain the interferograms of a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten halogen lamp to the latter yellow and green optical filter be apply by perform a fast fourier transform on the interferogram data we retrieve the wavelength spectrum of the source mean wavelength spectral width and coherence length of the source be calculate by approximate the spectrum to gaussian curve the value obtain be compatible with what expect with the exception of the coherence length result for filter light the error be thought to derive from the irregular shape of the filter light spectrum which could not be approximate well by a gaussian we determine that the two lead light be more efficient illumination source than the tungsten lamp a their spectrum fall almost exclusively in the visible range unlike the tungsten lamp spectrum nterferometry consists of a range of technique design to exploit the interference of electromagnetic wave to investigate the characteristic of the wave or of the material with which they interact 1 in 1907 michelson won the nobel prize in physic for his contribution in the field of interferometry the michelson interferometer have in fact several advantage over it predecessor be more versatile and capable of more precise measurement when it become apparent that the interference pattern detect could be use to retrieve the spectrum of the source michelson construct an analogue computer to carry out the fourier transforms need this technique have since proliferate due to the advent of fast and inexpensive computer 2 the aim of the experiment present be to use a michelson interferometer to study the spectrum of different light source describe them both qualitatively and quantitatively the first source consider be lead lamp that produce light use a light-emitting diode and be significantly more efficient than incandescent and fluorescent lamp we then study an incandescent tungsten lamp to which optical filter be apply in this report the main spectral difference between the two type of source will be outline a well a the effect that different filter have on the light spectrum interference consists in the superposition of two or more wave from the same source that be incident on the same point the interference be perfectly constructive when the wave be in phase which in the absence of a phase shift corresponds to their path difference be an integer multiple of their wavelength 3 a measure of the maximum path difference the two light beam can have before the interference pattern fade be give by the coherence length l that can be found use where c be the speed of light in a vacuum and δν be the bandwidth of the source 3 in a michelson interferometer the light beam emit by a source be amplitude-divided at the beam-splitter into two beam one reflect and one transmit a show in fig 1. the beam then travel to two mutually perpendicular mirror m1 and m2 in fig 1 and be reflect when the two light wave recombine at the beam-splitter they interfere in different way depend on the difference in the distance travel by the two ray the intensity of the light that reach the detector therefore depends on the path difference l and can be write a where a be the amplitude of the beam and σ1 their wavenumber 4 spectral analysis of lead and tungsten halogen lamp light use a michelson interferometer in the case of an extend source i.e not point-like light beam enter the system from numerous different angle result in an interference pattern characterise by concentric bright ring these fringe be call haidinger fringe and be show in fig 2. the interference pattern change a one of the mirror be translate a it cause the path difference l to change when l be be decrease the fringe shrink towards the centre of the interference pattern and conversely they spread out from the centre when l be be increase the record of this vary signal at the detector be call an interferogram the midpoint of the interferogram refer to a the null point corresponds to a path difference equal to zero 4 the vary intensity of the detect light can be express a a function of the spectral amplitude distribution of the source b σ by rewrite eq 2 in the form we can then split eq n into the two integral the first of which corresponds to a constant equal to half the intensity obtain with optically equidistant mirror therefore we have which be a cosine fourier transform of b σ i.e the real part of the full transform we can now calculate the spectrum of the source b σ a a function of the detect intensity use the inverse fourier transform the frequency composition of the source can therefore be retrieve from the interferogram with the use of fourier transforms 4 a the envelope of an interferogram follow a gaussian shape it be important to note that the fourier transform of a gaussian curve be still a gaussian curve the result gaussian have width inversely proportional to the width of the original one this proportionality be sometimes call the bandwidth theorem 5 for this experiment we use three different source a blue lead a white lead and a halogen tungsten lamp we take measurement of the tungsten light both unfiltered and filter the two filter use be a green filter and a yellow one with central wavelength give to be respectively 543.5 nm and 580 nm by the manufacturer both value have an uncertainty of 2 nm the setup of the michelson interferometer use be show in fig 1. to correctly align the component we use a green laser firstly we make sure that the mirror be perpendicular to the incoming light beam by check that the ray be be reflect back to the same point where they left the beam splitter secondly we make sure that the output ray reach the detector be overlap to achieve this we adjust the direction of two beam until they appear to overlap on a distant object we then add a plano-convex lens f 25.4mm to the source to observe the interference pattern to find the null point we decide to move the stage by 1 mm step and then scan very slowly over a small distance this allow u to determine if the fringe of the interference pattern be move inwards or outwards by refining our step we found the point where the direction of the fringe change that corresponds to the null point we then use a white lead light to find the null point more precisely a it have a broader emission spectrum and therefore a narrower interferogram in accordance with the bandwidth theorem we scan slowly over small interval around the null point 's approximate position found with the green laser until we observe a dark fringe on the detector correspond to the null point we proceed to take preliminary data in order to adjust the move mirror 's speed and the gain of the detector we then take data around the null point for each of the source adjust the range base on the size of the interferogram and with a sample rate of 50hz we found that the null point corresponds to a dark fringe not a bright one the interference with zero path difference be perfectly destructive a the beam splitter introduces a phase change of 90⁰ we observe that for the first 10-20 data point the position step record be not regular furthermore numerous data point be take at the final position after the stage have stop move for these reason we decide to crop our data to avoid shift in the wavelength spectrum to retrieve the wavelength spectrum from the interferograms we perform a fast fourier transform on the data set the step of the move mirror to be constant and equal to the average length of the measure step all the uncertainty report be obtain from the uncertainty on the fit or calculate use the standard formula 6 the wavelength specf lum obtain for the blue lead show in fig 3 be characterise by one single peak with mean wavelength equal to 455.3±0 in the case of a white lead show in fig 4 the spectmm present t\¥ 0 different peak a large one with wavelength range from yellow to red and a small one coitesponding to blue light this result agrees with what expect a the most common way of produce white lead consists in coat a blue or uv lead with a thin layer of phosphor that cause yellow light to be emit the combination of the blue and yellow light appear white to the human eye the thickness of the phosphor layer determines the colour temperature of the lamp 8 in our case the yellow-red component be predominant on the blue one result a warm white colour most of the white lead spectmm be within the visible range therefore only a small part of the energy supply to the source get conve1t ed in non-visible light make the white lead relatively efficient a a illumination source the wavelength spectrum obtain for filter and unfiltered tungsten lamp be show in fig 5. a expect the amplitude be reduce when filter be apply fig 5 not to scale the mean wavelength of the unfiltered light found in table l be shift when filter be apply the shift value for wavelength table l be compatible with expect range of 560-590 run for yellow light and 520-560 run for green light 7 the filter light specn•a be characterise by an in•egular shape which impact negatively on their fit and consequently on the value of spectral width and bandwidth obtain the unfiltered specf lum be well approximate by a gaussian wavelength nm fig 5. plot of tungsten light both unfiltered and filter use green and yellow optical filter ti1e dash line represent the gaussian fit spectrum the amplitude obtain with filter light be amplify by a factor of 30 to be visible in the same graph a the unfiltered light tue fit on the filter light data be very poor while the fit on the unfiltered light data follow the data reasonably well most of the specf lum for unfiltered tungsten light fall outside of the visible range this detennines a low efficiency a an illumination source we approximate the tungsten lamp to a blackbody and estimate it temperature to be 3500k by use wien 's displacement law tapea1 2.898•10-3 where t be the temperature this value be an overestimation on the expect value of around 3000k 9 suggest that the mean wavelength we calculate be likely to be inferior to the actual value 1 be compatible with the interferograms a they be of the same order of magnitude in the case of the white lead the coherence length be found consider the main peak only the coherence length value obtain for the filter light found in table 1 be not compatible with the coitesponding interferograms show in fig 6. these value should in fact be of the order of ioµm the en-or arises from the spectral width of the filter light obtain which be approximately ten time large than the value give by the manufacturer fwhm of i o run this discrepancy be mainly due to the fact wavelength data for filter light be poorly fit which result in a significant overestimation of the standard deviation and therefore of the spectral width and the bandwidth .. by compare the interferograms fig 6 and sub lot of fig 3 and 4 and the coitesponding spectrum it can be observe that wider interferograms coitespond to nrurnwer spectrum and viceversa a predict by the bandwidth theorem in this experiment we retrieve the spectrum of different light source by perfonning a fow'ier transfonn on their interferograms which we obtain with a michelson interferometer the source use be a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten halogen light the latter be employ both unfiltered and filter with green and yellow optical filter we determine that the lead sow•ces have naitower spectrum compru•ed to the unfiltered tungsten lamp and that these prevalently occupy the visible range for this reason we conclude that the lead study be more efficient illlllllination source than the incandescent tungsten light which spectium fall mostly outside of the visible range we found the mean wavelength of the blue lead 455 .3±0.3 run to be in wavelength interval of blue light a expect in the case of the white lead we found that two peak ru•e present a small one coitesponding to blue light and a main one in the range from yellow to red light this combination of t\¥ 0 frequency be perceive a white by the human eye we found that filte1'ing the tungsten light cause it spectruni to naitow and decrease in runplitude the specti•a of the filter tungsten light appear iitegular and much broader than what expect from the data provide by the manufacturer we be unable to properly fit these spectrum result in an incoitect calculation of the bandwidth and therefore of the coherence length of the filter light finally we approximate the tungsten lamp to a blackbody which allow u to determine that the mean wavelength value found 827.2±2.0 nm be likely to be an underestimate this expe1'iment could be improve by develop a more accurate way of processing the filter spectrum and by include in the eitor analysis the contribution of the fast fow•ier transform perform a described for example in an accurate e1ror analysis model f or fast fowier transform 10,deep,exp
158,2ndINT_BOD369_Redacted,a michelson interferometer be use to perform fourier-transform spectroscopy ft on three separate light source -a white lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapour lamp -in order to analyse their spectrum and therefore discern the manner in which they emit the source be expect to emit light via different physical process and be purposefully chosen a such to demonstrate both the versatility of ft and different spectrum form via different form of luminescence t he michelson interferometer fig 1 have provide success in help to discern the nature of electromagnetic wave most famously by the negative result of the michelson-morley experiment 1887 to suggest the non-existence of the luminiferous ether in this series of experiment we use a michelson interferometer a a fourier transform spectrometer in order to analyse the property of three light source a white lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapour lamp this technique involves measure the total intensity i λ of the interference pattern produce by a light source at a single point a a function of the path difference λ between it can be show that the transform pair of i λ be i k where k 1 λ be the wave number and λ be the wavelength of light be detect 1 the exact form of i λ be likely to be too complex to be transform by hand therefore this must generally be do computationally an interferometer induces an interference pattern so that the characteristic of source emission may be analyse however this pattern be effect by both path difference a well a the coherence of the interfere light path difference effect how the split wave will superpose when recombine this be most straight forward for monochromatic light where the amplitude detect a λ be related to the path difference λ between the split beam by where a be half the amplitude of the source beam in this case 1 spatial and temporal coherence of a source will effect how emission interfere temporal coherence be a measure of the correlation of a wave 's phase at different point along the direction of propagation that be how the emission from the source varies in time fig 2a a temporally incoherent source will never cause an interference pattern a the phase shift a function of time of the split wave will differ and the pattern will alter too quickly to be detectable 1 note however that a partially temporally coherent source will still produce discernible fringe when the path difference of the split beam be small spatial coherence be a measure of the correlation of a wave 's phase at different point perpendicular to the direction of propagation that be how the source emission varies across a wave-front fig 2b 2 a all the source use be extend they be all therefore spatially incoherent in this paper the coherence length shall be define a for approximately gaussian distribution where ∆λ be the twice the standard deviation of the gaussian and λ be it peak wavelength 3 this represent the range centre on the point of zero path difference which shall be refer to a the null point within which fringe will be easily detectable for example a broad spectrum with large ∆λ will produce a very narrow region within which fringe exist the interferometer be set up a in fig 1 where the mirror be position to be approximately the same distance 15cm from the beam splitter accuracy in position be not necessary a all path difference be to be control by the movable mirror therefore so long a a large enough range centre on the midpoint exist data could be take effectively a 100mm focal length lens be fix to the beam splitter entrance to focus the beam during splitting and reflection this be do so a to reduce the loss in luminosity of the beam due to dispersion before recombination a 25.4mm focal length lens be attach to the splitter exit to spread out the fringe so they could be more easily distinguish by the detector within the housing of the interferometer the photodetector use be an osram sfh 2200 photodiode set to have a sample rate of 50hz 4 the effective range of detection can be see in fig 3. a 532nm laser be use to calibrate the mirror a any interference pattern would be easily see and should exist for a large range of path difference due to the laser 's large coherence length it can be show that fringe separation increase a the interfere beam become more parallel a such the mirror fig 3. effectiveness of detector across a range of wavelength 4 be adjust until a set of haidinger fringe be see to be centre on the detector a this would maximise contrast between fringe 9 10 a region contain the null point be found by observe the region within which the central fringe be the only one visible a the interfere beam simply superpose to form the source beam and thus produce no interference pattern once a sufficiently small range be found the laser be replace by a blue lead and a measurement take across that range to find the null point more easily this be do a ∆λ for the lead be much small than that of the laser and a such the region in which fringe could be detect would be localise to a small region surround the null point it be found to be 7.24 ± 0.001mm from the zero point on the move mirror a far measurement be take with no light source active in order to establish the level of background noise with reading found to be ∼ 100 time dimmer than the mercury lamp and ∼ 10000 time dimmer than the lead and tungsten lamp the first source under consideration be a white lead in order to achieve a broad spectrum in the visible a violet lead be commonly use to stimulate a phosphor layer to produce a spectrum similar to that in fig 4a white light can also be produce through the combination of red green and blue light from three separate lead produce a spectrum similar to that of fig 4b fringe produce by the rgb lead should noticeably beat due to the superposition of three distinct wavelength of similar amplitude where a the `` warm `` lead would likely lack this quality the second source be that of an incandescent tungsten lamp heat to around 2800k under these condition tungsten should act a a black body radiator produce a spectrum like that in fig 5. when the effective detector range be take into account the spectrum should drop off very rapidly beyond 950nm produce a spectrum of coherence length very similar to that of the detector sensitivity ∼ 1µm the third source be a mercury vapour lamp this work by excite the electron in mercury vapour to emit light upon move to a low energy from this excite state heisenberg 's uncertainty principle can be use to relate the lifetime of an excite state with the uncertainty of it energy a short lifetime will have a large energy uncertainty and thus a large ∆λ 8 in this way the coherence length of an emission will be determine by the stability of the excite state of interest line of note within the effective range of the detector should be those of 403 435 546 578 and 1012. v. data analysis the white lead be fit and measurement take across a 0.35mm interval centre on the position of the null point see fig 7 and the spectrum compute with fit gaussian distribution overlaid onto the peak see fig 8. the fringe appear to display no beating far the spectrum show a broad peak in the visible with a small peak in the violet imply that the source be more similar to the `` warm `` lead however a certain level of asymmetry about the maximum be present which remains unexplained the total coherence length be calculate to be 6.07µm to 3 significant figure the tungsten filament lamp be then use a a light source this produce light via incandescence and a such the emission spectrum should have a similar form to that of a black body spectrum fig 5. however likely due to the detector 's effective range the spectrum peak at 806 nm and then rapidly decline to zero after around 900nm the fringe themselves can be see in fig 9 and exist over a very small interval ∼ 10 −6 metre which be to be expect for a source of coherence length calculate to be 1.68µm to 3 significant figure this be on the same order a our estimate base off of the detector range far support that this be the limit factor fig 8. spectrum derive from take fourier transform of data in fig 7. this spectrum be extremely similar in form to that of the `` warm `` lead in fig 3a imply that the lead be of similar construction the mercury source be far dimmer than any other source use and a warm up period be require to allow all the mercury to vaporise the spectrum fig 12 display a number of distinct peak however too much noise exists within the information in order to accurately fit a set of gaussian function mapping to the position of the peak a such the coherence length of the source can not be effectively calculate use this data however the nature of the fringe measure in fig 11 would imply that the total distance across which the fringe be visible be great than the 2mm range which be measure thus the coherence length be likely great than 2mm furthermore the narrowness of peak see in fig 12 would imply that the excite state of interest have a relatively long lifetime and so the state of interest be quite stable however in order to produce an accurate estimate measurement would be need across the whole of the interference pattern the two high peak occur around those predict in fig 5 however a third primary peak occurs at an unpredicted wavelength of approximately 510nm possibly imply that there be some contaminant element in the lamp a small amount of argon be commonly use a a medium in lamp of this kind however this emission line be not typical of argon or mercury imply that some other element be likely present 11 moreover there be an unexpected peak at 1072nm however in fig 6 a broader peak can be see this be more similar to that of a black body spectrum likely cause by the internal heating within the lamp which may serve a an explanation it can be see in fig 11 that the maximum be not centre on the expect location of the null point 7.24 ± 0.001mm this be likely a for small wavelength error in set up become more prominent a the resultant path difference correspond to large phase difference eq 1. vi conclusion three different type of light source be analyse use ft a white lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapour lamp all of which be partially temporally incoherent a well a be spatially incoherent it be found that the white lead produce a spectrum fig 8 more similar to that of a phosphor base `` warm `` white lead fig 4a than that of a lead make up of separate red green and blue lead fig 4b produce the spectrum in fig 8 with a coherence length of 6.07µm to 3 significant figure the tungsten filament lamp be expect to have a the spectrum of a black body at 2800k fig 5 however likely due to the effective range of the detector fig 3 this spectrum rapidly decline shortly after 900nm peak at 806nm with a coherence length calculate to be 1.68µm to 3 significant figure by comparison we can then say that the lead be a more coherent source than then tungsten lamp the mercury source produce a spectrum fig 12 with a distinct set of peak although the data be not stable enough to effectively produce a gaussian describe the nature of the emission line a a result a coherence length could not be calculate however it magnitude could be expect to be great than 2mm a the full set of fringe do not appear to be present in fig 11. a notable peak be situate at 511nm which do not exist in the expect mercury emission spectrum nor in the spectrum of argon a common medium in lamp of this kind this implies that there be likely some other contaminant present in the lamp emit there be also another unexpected peak at 1072nm which may be cause by black body radiation from heating in the lamp in order to verify any of these hypothesis however measurement must be take across the entirety of the mercury lamp

search for the presence of the 'luminiferous aether a no variation in the speed of light be detect a new theory be require this lead to the development of special relativity by albert einstein the technique of interferometry be still very much at the fore-front of scientific research a very precise measure device can be design upon it principle currently interferometer be be use to measure the tiny change in length cause by gravitational wave in this experiment interferograms of a tungsten filament lamp and a white lead be record the fourier transform of the data be then take to provide the wavelength spectrum of the light source the efficiency of the source in emit visible light be then compare interference occurs when two or more wave interact the result pattern produce depends on the amplitude of each wave at that position there be an alternate pattern of bright and dark fringe a the wave oscillate from interfere constructively to destructively for monochromatic light of equal amplitude the pattern be a function of the phase difference between the wave in the case of an interferometer this phase difference be cause by the fact that one wave have travel a different distance relative to the other fourier analysis be require to consider light with an arbitrary frequency spectrum this result in the follow relation between j the interferogram and s the power spectrum of the source where ∆ be the distance from the null point and ν be frequency j be the fourier cosine transform of the spectral power density s 1 a hot filament will glow with a characteristic frequency spectrum the wavelength at which the peak of this spectrum occurs be give by the follow equation the spectrum will be approximately gaussian in it distribution a there be slight random variation in temperature within the filament which be normally distribute about a mean value lead 's work on the phenomenon of electroluminescence where electron recombine with hole in a semiconductor release light a they do so if there be some element of randomness in the energy release when the electron recombine then it can also be expect that the lead 's spectrum will have some sort of gaussian distribution a michelson interferometer consists of a beam splitter and two plane mirror arrange a show in fig 1. the system be very sensitive to vibration and therefore must be isolated from the surroundings to reduce erroneous noise in the data this be achieve by place the component on an optical breadboard the whole system be position within a blacked-out box and the light in the laboratory be turn off so that the effect of variation in the ambient light be minimise the detector be also shield from the light source use tube and piece of black card in order for reliable data to be take the interferometer have to be carefully align initially the translational mi1rnr be fix in place on it translation stage the beam splitter be then position a sho1t distance away and it orientation be adjust until it be at 45 degree to the translational minor this be achieve use a laser and adjudge to be when the laser beam reflect by the beam splitter and it reflection from the translational minor fonned one spot on the beam splitter the rotatable minor be then position approximately the same distance away from the beam splitter -as measure by a piece of string a piece of white card be then put in the position of the detector and move a far away from the beam splitter a feasibly possible the position of the beam from the translational mirror on the card be then marked the orientation of the rotatable miitor be then adjust so that the beam from each arm form one spot on the piece of card this be adj udged to be when there be no discemible change in shape when one of the beam be block there may also be some additional spot on the card however these can be minimise with careful alignment a magnetic rnler be then use to verify that the laser beam be the same height above the optical breadboard in all place meaning that the system be in an optical plane a planoconvex lens of focal length 25.4mm be then position between the laser and the beam splitter to make the laser an extend source the interference pattem on the card be then clearly visible with the naked eye the orientation of the rotatable miirnr be then finetuned so that the centre of the circular fringe be in the same position a the mark on the card a michelson interferometer can produce fringe in concentric circle or straight line which be visible depends on whether the two mirror be a1rnnged so that they be perpendicular or not a the miitors be move fuither away from be pe1pendicular the fringe become straighter and closer together for this experiment it be not a requirement to have the miirnrs perpendicular a the fringe move at the same rate irrespective of their shape finally the detector a photodiode connect to an amplifier with variable gain be position so that the centre of the circular fringe be at it centre the detector use responds linearly to light intensity meaning that the data it record can be directly plot a the intensity of the light 2 in arbitrary unit the interferometer be now align however the null point still need to be found to do this the translate mirror be put at approximately the same distance from the beam splitter a the rotational mirror -again use the piece of string a quick interferogram be take with white light in a range a couple of mm either side of this position with the maximum in intensity of the interferogram correspond to the null point of the interferometer white light should be use in find the null point a once the interferogram have retwned to a. constant value either side of the pa.ttem you can be sure that the maximum of the interferogram corresponds to the null point of the interferometer -provided there be no asymmetrical phase shift cause by the optic use once the interferometer have be align and the null point found data be take in a small range either side use the light source of interest a tungsten lamp with fibre couple be use a the first white light source -producing the interferogram show in fig 3. fibre couple be necessary to make the sow•ce small enough to fit in the interferometer it be a graph of signal strength 14000 to 26000 in arbitra1y unit against position 8.47 to 8.5 in mm when the fourier

the p eaks correspond to be weight accord to the amplitude of the peak then it give a black body temperature of 5600 ± 30 k. the efficiency in radiate light in the visible region be 98 ± 0.5 this

experiment which disprove the presence of an ether in 1887 1 more recently it be use in ligo to make the first observation of gravitational wave 2 the michelson interferometer be adjust to have one movable mirror in order to use it a a spectroscope spectroscopy be fundamental in our understand of the universe a it allows for the analysis of the structure and composition of matter the michelson interferometer can be amend for use a a spectroscope by make one of the mirror moveable a show in figure 1. light be split into two beam by a partiallysilvered mirror beamsplitter the two branch of light travel via path a and b to their respective mirror and be reflect back to the beamsplitter where they be recombine this light be then detect by the photodetector which be compose of a photodiode and amplifier the moveable mirror be mount on a motorise stage and allows for a path difference to occur there be a path difference when the light travel along path a have to travel far than b due to a movement of the position of the stage when the path difference be zero or a multiple of the wavelength of light then the two beam of light will interfere constructively and if the path difference be half the wavelength of light then there will be destructive interference thus a mirror m1 move the two light branch go in and out of phase create an interference pattern at the detector the detector be connect to a linux terminal where an interferogram of the data be observe when the `` take data `` command be initiate to obtain the electromagnetic spectrum of the interferogram a fourier transform be take to decompose the signal into it frequency the dielectric plate on the beamsplitter in figure 1 result in the phase change of one of the beam of light meaning at zero path difference the light will interfere destructively the null point be where the mirror m1 and m2 be equidistant to the beamsplitter and the path difference be zero like in figure 1 form a central dark fringe on the detector scan about this point be what make the michelson interferometer into a spectrometer there be two type of interference pattern show in figure 2 that can be observe on the detector haidinger fringe and fizeau fringe fizeau fringe be of equal straight thickness and appear to be close to the mirror on the other hand haidinger fringe appear to be at infinity and produce a pattern of concentric circle 4 these be most useful for find the null point from the interferogram several piece of data can be found such a the mean wavelength λ and the coherence length l which be a measure of the spectral quality of a light source 3 the coherence length can be found by assume the light source be gaussian and take it standard deviation σ a the coherence length more practically this can be found use the full width at half maximum fwhm of the interferogram in the follow equation fig 2. on the left example of haidinger fringe 4 on the right example of fizeau fringe 5 this can be use to find the spectral width of frequency ∆ν which be a measure of the range of frequency the light source emits here c be the speed of light furthermore the spectral width can be convert into a unit of wavelength to find the spectral width of the wavelength ∆λ the tungsten light source emits black body radiation and so wien 's displacement law can be use to find it temperature t during emission this be compare to the mercury discharge lamp which have set energy level which the electron can excite and decay between emit photon a they fall to low energy state in this way the mercury lamp should produce clear spectral line to show the quantisation of energy the lamp also emits uv which be of a shorter wavelength than the tungsten light which emits visible light have construct the michelson interferometer a a spectroscope in figure 1 we then align it we do this by use the green laser a it have a narrow beam we first make sure the distance between the mirror and beamsplitter be the same use a ruler so that they would align close to where there would be a central dark fringe we make sure the mirror be perpendicular to the beamsplitter with the dot of green laser light center in the middle of each mirror by make sure the light source be on the optical axis the angle of the non-moveable mirror be adjustable so we be able to tilt the mirror so that it reflect light overlap the light from the other mirror on the photodetector we then want to find the null point the position of the stage where we observe the dark central haidinger fringe we do this by two method the first be to continue use the green laser and add a lens to find the range of stage position where the haidinger fringe seem to change direction and where they be the straightest after have found this range we then switch the light source to a white lead with a diffuser the null point be found on the interferogram by a clear peak in the signal we then decrease the range of stage movement to focus on this area where a rainbow of light be observe on the photodetector and a black spot at the exact null point however this method be slow a the range determine by the green laser to find the null point in be not accurate a we found the null point just outside this range the second more refine method that we use be to scan the white lead signal over a long range at the minimum sample rate where interference be still observe the rate be calculate by consider the photodetector which sample at a frequency of 50hz and the white lead of 10µm coherence length result in a motor speed of 0.05mms −1 over the long scan a peak be see we then narrow the range of the moveable mirror position to get a clear image of the interference pattern this method be faster and so be our prefer method have found the null point we then take interferograms about this point to characterise the light source white light tungsten and a mercury discharge lamp we also take interferograms of the light source with a green and yellow filter on to find the average and peak wavelength of the light source we take a fft with the x-axis a oscillation per step we then take the positive part of the ft and convert the data from oscillation per step to step per oscillation and found the time per step size from this and assume the signal be gaussian we found the peak wavelength and average wavelength the coherence length spectral width and the wien temperature of the white light tungsten use equation 1 4 we also reproduce the shape of the filter function for yellow light tungsten by take an inverse ft of the interferogram for the mercury discharge lamp with the green filter we found the wavelength of the singlet and test the reproducibility of the distance move by the stage by plot wavelength against stage position for the yellow filter we analyse the doublet spectrum by consider the noise that result in the low resolution data scan around the null point with the white lead produce the flow of a beautiful rainbow pattern show in figure 3. the rainbow begin with blue and yellow stripe since these colour have the shortest wavelength and continued to become more intense in colour add the colour red of longer wavelength in image 6 and 7. the rainbow pattern be observe due to white light be compose of different colour of light have different wavelength and so have different path difference this mean the colour interfere at different position of the stage movement a the null point be approach the path difference begin to align so that at the null point a black dot be observe a all colour interfere destructively the interferogram for white light tungsten around the null point be show in figure 4. there be a clear peak in the interference at the null point with an almost symmetric shape we found the null point to be at the stage position 0.633±5×10 −4 mm the data we obtain from the white light tungsten be displayed in table i. our value 457nm±25nm for the average wavelength be within the expect range of the tungsten lamp broadband of 360-2600nm 6 we have obtain reasonable value except for the 6.34k temperature of tungsten which be extremely low the specification state that the temperature should be 2796±15k so the data varies by a factor of 186. a possible reason for this could be that we approximate the tungsten light source to have a gaussian shape interferogram but in figure 4 we see that it be not symmetric this be because the tungsten lamp be actually a black body emitter hence our assumption affect the accuracy of our result there be also experimental source of error due to noise and the non-linear motion of the motorise stage to check if the asymmetry of 4 be due to the motor movement we take interferograms of the stage move in both direction past the null point we observe the same asymmetry ruling out the direction of stage movement a a cause we test the tungsten lamp to see if there be a variation in signal intensity but it be constant with 0 standard deviation this aligns with specification of the tungsten lamp have less than 0.05 output power stability there could be contribution of external light affect the interference pattern a well a misalignment of the mirror cause not all light to overlap however we thought the error be more fundamental than this and so we test the reproducibility of the stage motor with the mercury discharge lamp with a green filter the interferograms of the tungsten light with a green and yellow filter on be show in figure 5 where we observe a diminish beating pattern the filter transform the signal pattern into that of a sinc function described by x otherwise this be because the filter act a top hat function which be then fourier transform into sinc function on the interferogram therefore we can take an inverse ft of the interferograms to find the shape of the filter to do this we have to first perform a hilbert transformation to fit the envelope of the beating shape in 5. we use the fit from the envelope to do the inverse ft. we do this process for the yellow filter tungsten and compare it to the inverse ft of a simple sinc function show in 6. a we can see from the graph our experimental data do n't produce the expect top hat shape but a clear peak we expect to see gibb 's phenomenon of over and undershoot at the discontinuity however it be unclear if there be any in the experimental graph at the base or if this be just noise the restriction of light allow to pa by the green filter be show by the peak and zero magnitude outside the interferogram of the mercury discharge lamp be show in figure 7. on the left side of the graph we can see that the jagged line be produce because the motor briefly jolt forward and backwards before it move more smoothly in the instruct direction from take several reading we found that it be important to keep the lamp on so that we do n't take any reading where it be `` warm up `` a this process be visible in the strength of signal produce there be a lot of noise on the interferogram so not much can be see however when we fft it we decompose the signal to see it wavelength there be a broad spectrum of wavelength in 8 show that the data take be very noisy we found the maximum wavelength of the light to be 542.9nm this be in the range of the expect value of wavelength allow to pa through the green filter of 543.5±2nm 7 we expect a gaussian shape for figure 8 but it be slightly asymmetric we think this be because the position of the mirror on the stage be at a different place to where it say it be and thus due to the motor there be an error on all measurement the error from the motor be best show in figure 9 where we expect a constant wavelength yet there appear to be a periodic pattern of wavelength this clearly show that the motor do not move smoothly a the manufacturer claim but move in small step the pattern be most likely due to the coil in the motor give a systematic error which we quantify to 25nm for each wavelength calculate the interferogram of the mercury discharge lamp with a yellow filter show a beating pattern in figure 10. the beating pattern be due to the doublet produce in the spectrum once a fft be perform on the interferogram due to noise it be not possible to resolve the two spectral line however a graph of their wavelength could be obtain show in figure 11. the two wavelength be found by take the maximum wavelength of each peak give 585nm and 671nm a reason for the heavy noise on the mercury data could have be due to the relative sensitivity of the photodetector accord to it specification the detector be most sensitive to light of wavelength around 900nm which be in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum we can see from the graph in figure 12 that the sensitivity be less than 20 in the uv region hence to improve the accuracy of our result we should consider use a photodetector more sensitive to shorter wavelength a a result we need the gain on our detector to be a high a possible to improve resolution of the interferograms another source of noise for the mercury discharge lamp be the variation in intensity of the light source itself this be show clearly by figure 13 where we see a large spread in intensity and significantly a wide peak this be confirm by the standard deviation calculate to be 15.22 and the average wavelength show on the graph at 139.54 give a standard error of 0.317. sum the error from the motor movement detector sensitivity and the mercury discharge lamp intensity variation we put the error on our wavelength at 50nm we use the michelson interferometer a a spectrometer to characterise a tungsten light source and mercury discharge lamp we found the null point use a white lead where we observe the splitting of the light to produce a colourful flow interference pattern we found the wavelength of white light tungsten to be 457±25nm which agrees with the manufacturer 's specification but be far out of range for the calculate temperature of tungsten we reconstruct the shape of the yellow filter on the tungsten light source where we obtain a peak rather than a top hat shape from analysis of the mercury discharge lamp with a green filter we be able to quantise the error on our data from the motor a 25nm we also found the wavelength to be 542.9±50nm which be in the expect range of the green filter broadband lastly we found the wavelength of the mercury discharge lamp with a yellow filter a 585±50nm and 671±50nm to improve this experiment i would use a detector more sensitive to uv light for the mercury discharge lamp data and use a stage which move at a linear speed,prediction,the
161,2ndINT_LZH215_Redacted,2 abstract-the aim of this investigation be to use interferometry to find the wavelength of various source we do this by construct our own interferometer with a translation mirror we observe how the interference pattern change when the translation mirror be move about the null point the wavelength be then use to find the power radiate per unit area use wien 's displacement law and stefan-boltzmann 's law it be found the blue lead have a wavelength of 483.1 ± 0.4 nm the white lead have an average wavelength of 549.9 ± 0.8 nm the tungsten source with the no filter have an average wavelength of 563.3 ± 0.9 nm the tungsten with a yellow filter have a wavelength of 569.7 ± 0.6 nm finally the tungsten source with a green filter have a wavelength of 555.4 ± 0.4 nm the power radiate per unit area be found to be 3.672 ± 0.054 ×10 7 wm -2 for the tungsten source with no filter for the tungsten source with a green filter the power radiate per unit area be 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 while the tungsten source with a green filter have a power output per unit area of 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 the main error associate with the experiment be the fact that the fitting function assume that the distance between consecutive measurement be constant nterferometry have be an incredible useful technique throughout history from it invention in 1887 by albert a. michelson and edward w. morley to disprove the aether which lead to einstein 's theory of special relativity to the modern-day find of gravitational wave 1 this technique which relies on the principle of the interference of light be still relevant and essential to the modern scientist we will use interferometry to first measure the wavelength of a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten lamp with various filter then by assume the tungsten source be a black-body investigate the power radiate per unit area by tungsten with the differ filter in this experiment we will construct a traditional michelson and morley interferometer with a tilt mirror and a translation mirror interferometry relies on the coherence of the light beam to produce an interference pattern by move the translation mirror the coherence will change cause a visible change in the interference pattern we will use this effect to measure the various wavelength of the source and use this find the temperature and power radiate per unit area for the black-body source interferometry allows u to measure small distance accurately thus we should obtain an accurate and precise measurement of the wavelength coherent wave be two wave which have a constant phase difference the same frequency and similar waveform the measure of how well the wave meet these criterion be call coherence when two coherent monochromatic wave meet the 2 wave will superpose add together and form an interference pattern like that show in figure 1. at place where a wave peak from one wave meet another wave peak constructive inference occurs at place where a wave peak from one wave meet another wave trough destructive inference occurs mathematically constructive interference be give by ∆𝐿 𝑚𝜆 and destructive interference be give by ∆𝐿 𝑚 0.5 𝜆 where ∆𝐿 be the path difference between the wave difference be distance the 2 wave have travel if they have the same source m be any integer and λ be the wavelength of light if the wave be n't monochromatic and be make of many wavelength each wavelength of the same value will interfere this cause point of constructive and destructive interference of each wavelength a show in figure 1. if the path difference be constant the point of constructive inference and destructive remain the same form a stationary still pattern find the wavelength and power radiate per unit area of black-body source use interferometry i iii method the experiment be setup a show in figure 2 with the whole apparatus on an optical board in an opaque black plastic box to absorb external light the two mirror be set approximately equal distance from the beam splitter a green laser be use a a source to align the interferometer the detector be replace by a piece of card and use the adjustment nob on the tilt mirror the two beam through the beam splitter be make incident on the same point on the card this result in faint parallel fridge in the diffract light surround the beam point then a 25.4 mm convex lens follow by a long tube be put between the laser and beam splitter this enlarge the interference pattern such that it be visible the mirror be then tilt in the horizontal plane until circular fridge where see the piece of card be then replace by detector and the circular fridge be centre on the detector the null point be then found by move the motorize translation mirror through the full range which it can move this be do by set the translation mirror to -12mm then run it to 12mm at speed of 0.02 mm -1 the interferogram be plot use the point of maximum and minimum intensity be identify a the null point the null point be found to be between 2.9 mm to 3 mm on the translation mirror scale the lens and laser be then replace by the white lead source follow by ground glass the translation mirror be then move about the null point from 2.9 mm to 3 mm on the translation mirror scale at a speed of 0.001 mm -1 the interferogram be plot this be repeat with the blue lead this be also repeat with a tungsten source with no filter a yellow filter and green filter however with the tungsten source a collimator and the lens be place in front of the source while the filter be place between the beam splitter and detector and the ground glass be remove then the interferogram be fit to a sine wave and a histogram be plot to show the various wavelength in the source use the plot the most predominant wavelength be found or an average wavelength be calculate use equation 4 and 5 the temperature and power radiate per unit area be found for the tungsten source the blue lead be found to contain several wavelength around the blue wavelength of light however a wavelength of 483.1 ± 0.4 nm be by far the most predominant the interferogram be show below in figure 4. the interferogram show the sinusoidal change in signal strength with distance around the null point the maximum signal strength of this waveform increase and the minimum signal strength decrease this be contain within an envelope center on the null point the white lead be found to contain several wavelength around the visible light range however the weight average wavelength be 549.9 ± 0.8 nm the reason the average be weight be due to the fact that the white lead have a wavelength of 488.2 ± 0.3 nm in blue wavelength range which be twice a intense a the other wavelength i believe this be due to the fact that the source produce the various wavelength in an asymmetric distribution this be see when the lead be direct at a distance it become slightly blue tint moreover the interferogram show in figure 5 be asymmetric the tungsten source with the no filter be found to contain wavelength around the yellow and green wavelength of light a show in figure 6. the average wavelength be 563.3 ± 0.9 nm the temperature be found to be 5145 ± 8 k and a power output per unit area of 3.672 ± 0.054 ×10 7 wm -2 the tungsten source with the yellow filter be found to contain a predominant wavelength in the yellow wavelength of light at 569.7 ± 0.6 nm a show in figure 7. the temperature be found to be 5087 ± 5 k and a power output per unit area of 3.797 ± 0.016 ×10 7 wm -2 the tungsten source with the green filter be found to contain several wavelength around the green wavelength of light however a wavelength of 555.4 ± 0.4 nm be by far the most predominant a show in figure 8. the temperature be found to be 5218 ± 4 k and a power output per unit area of 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 the effective temperature of the sun be 5778 k 10 which be similar to the temperature of the source moreover the power radiate per unit area by the sun be 6.14×10 7 wm -2 which be also similar to those we obtain this be due to the fact that the sun mainly emits visible light a the source do the error in the wavelength ∆𝜆 be take a the maximum histogram bar size from this the error in the temperature ∆𝑇 be give by ∆𝑇 𝑇∆𝜆 𝜆 the error in the power radiate per unit area ∆𝑃 be give by ∆𝑃 𝑃∆𝑇 𝑇 the error fails to include the fact that while the apparatus be on an optical bench it be still very sensitive to vibration due to the fact small distance be be measure this be difficult to control when there be many people walk around the lab also external light may have enter the apparatus even though it be cover in an opaque plastic box there be hole in the box to allow cable out of the apparatus which light could diffract through the small the whole the more diffraction would occur however the large the hole the grater the intensity of the light which diffracts furthermore in our calculation for fitting the wavelength we assume the translation mirror move by a constant distance every time it take a measurement however this be not the case the mirror take measurement at a frequency of 50 hz but the distance between these measurement varied more accurate data could have be take if the resolution of the interference pattern be well the resolution r be give by the expression 11 𝜆 thus the resolution be dependent on the distance the mirror move if measurement be take over a great range about the null point the uncertainty in the wavelength would decrease the aim of this investigation be to use interferometry to find the wavelength of various source we do this by construct our own interferometer with a translation mirror we observe how the interference pattern and coherence change by measure how the signal strength varied at a point on the interference pattern with the translation mirror move about the null point it be found the blue lead have a wavelength of 483.1 ± 0.4 nm the white lead have an average wavelength of 549.9 ± 0.8 nm but have predominant blue wavelength at 488.2 ± 0.3 nm due to the asymmetric distribution of wavelength the tungsten source with the no filter be found to contain wavelength around the yellow and green wavelength of light with the average wavelength of 563.3 ± 0.9 nm the tungsten with the yellow filter be found to contain a predominant wavelength in the yellow wavelength of light at 569.7 ± 0.6 nm finally the tungsten source with the green filter be found to contain several wavelength around the green wavelength of light however a wavelength of 555.4 ± 0.4 nm be by far the most predominant we then use the wavelength for the tungsten source to find the power radiate per unit area by assume they be black-bodies and apply wien 's displacement law and stefan-boltzmann 's law the power radiate per unit area be found to be 3.672 ± 0.054 ×10 7 wm -2 for the tungsten source with no filter for the tungsten source with a green filter the power radiate per unit area be 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 while the tungsten source with the green filter have a power output per unit area of 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 these result be similar to those from sun which have a power radiate per unit area of 6.14×10 7 wm -2 10 the main error associate with the experiment be the fact that the fitting function assume that the distance between

162,2ndINT_VLS445_Redacted,this paper report on the outcome of an investigation into interferometry carry out use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer the aim of the investigation be to characterise different light source and describe their spectrum quantitively the source be discus in this paper be white and blue light-emitting diode lead and a white light tungsten source the tungsten source be use either with no filter or with a yellow or green filter interferograms of each source be take and they be fourier transform to produce spectral line the white lead have a spectral width of 3.41±0.01 ×10 13 hz and the blue lead have a spectral width of 3.81±0.09 ×10 15 hz the tungsten source with no filter have a spectral width of 3.91±0.03 ×10 13 hz and it temperature be also calculate to be 3620 ± 11.5 k. from this it be conclude that the tungsten source be a blackbody radiation emitter and that the white lead use be a blue lead with additional phosphor it be also conclude that the method of use this interferometer a a spectrometer be very accurate due to the close agreement of measure value with accepted value the michelson interferometer be first design in 1887 by albert a. michelson and edward w. morley in their famous experiment give the name the michelson-morley experiment the aim of their experiment be to detect the existence of an ether which be proposedly a medium that carry light wave after observe that there be no path difference between the light beam travel perpendicular through the ether and the beam travel parallel the ether theory have to be disregard this be why this experiment be often coin the most famous fail experiment a the result eventually lead to the formulation of special relativity by albert einstein the interferometer split a light beam into two part and each part be make to travel to two perpendicular mirror via different path length the two beam be brought back together at the detector where they interfere accord to their path length this be what allows interferograms to be drawn a the signal measure be record a a function of position the layout of the interferometer be show in the schematic diagram in figure 1. the light emit from the source be split into two by a partially silver mirror which act a a beam splitter the reflect beam a travel to mirror m1 and the transmit beam b travel to m2 the beam splitter have a dielectric plate on one side to ensure destructive interference occurs at exactly zero path difference this be so that a dark fringe be observe rather than a bright output and this allows for an easy location of the null point described later in the method at other path difference the type of interference be determine by whether the distance travel by the two beam differ by λ or by λ/2 if the path difference be an integer multiple of λ constructive interference will be detect and if it be an integer multiple of λ/2 destructive interference will be detect at intermediate path difference a superposition of the two beam determines the output at the detector move one of the mirror by a distance a small a the wavelength of light cause an observable change at the detector this be what make the michelson interferometer an extremely precise instrument for characterise the wavelength and spectral width of light source the mirror m2 can be tilt to change the cylindrical symmetry of the mirror this produce a different type of straight-line fringe call fizeau fringe whereas if m2 be left untitled circular haidinger fringe will appear figure 2 show the relationship between spectral line shape and their interferograms a result of fourier theory state that a gaussian spectral feature lead to a gaussian temporal feature the spectral feature have a gaussian shape due to the many wavelength be present and the impossibility of have a perfectly sharp spectral line this be because three main reason i quantum mechanical uncertainty in the energy of level with finite lifetime ii collisional broadening where collision reduce the effective lifetime of a state and iii doppler or thermal broadening where atom be move relative to the observer in addition to this there be an inverse relationship between the spectral width and the interferogram width this be due to the two graph be fourier transforms of each other the equation from which spectral width can be calculate be give in equation 1 below where ν be the spectral width l be the coherence length and c be the speed of light in a vacuum λ be the mean wavelength of the source and ∆λ be the spectral width convert from frequency to wavelength coherence length be a measure of the distance over which one arm of the interferometer can be scan before the interferogram contrast becomes poor therefore there be a few different way of calculate this for different source the method use in this report be by measure the full width at half maximum fwhm of the gaussian spectral feature and then use the follow relationship to calculate l a for the tungsten source it be a blackbody radiation emitter so it temperature could be calculate use equation 3. in addition to this the same spectral width calculation also apply except that the calculation become less accurate when a filter be use a there be multiple peak so the coherence length be more ambiguous t λ peak 2.898 × 10 −3 4 the interferometer be built a show in figure 1. the next step be to align the two light beam a strong green laser be use for this due to it high visibility than other source a lens be also add at the end of the beam splitter to far increase the ease of align the two light beam by eye once the two beam be align on top of each other mirror m2 be tilt to ensure hailinder fringe be be observe to allow for location of the null point find the null point be not a short process and there be many challenge that be overcome in find it firstly the green laser be use to narrow the range of where the null point would be found this be do by move the stage at a relatively high speed 0.005 and watch when the circular fringe converge in the opposite direction they state converge in this give a range of about 0.1mm then the laser be carefully swap with a white lead and the chosen range over which t would be scan be very specific now the 'take-data function use on linux take 3 argument i the position the stage will move to ii the speed at which it will do so and iii the number of sample after which the detector will stop take reading the challenge in find the null point include how fast the stage should move to ensure the null point be not miss this be solve simply by decrease the speed of the stage around the specify range the other challenge be the ambiguity at time of the range be determine by the green laser due to the fringe not visibly show whether they 're move inwards or outwards this be solve by increase the range scan whilst use the white light the main challenge face when take the real data for the lead and tungsten source be the sample frequency a the stage move too little sample cause the data to be less accurate because the fourier transform be perform on python will not be smooth enough due to large amount of data miss however if too many sample be take the stage would have to move very slowly and this cause an ambiguity in to where the stage think it at and therefore the position collect in the data this cause a lot of noise to be see on the fourier transform of the interferogram this challenge be solve by study the nyquist theorem and settle on a sample frequency in between both extreme after align the interferometer and find the null point the data be take for the three source be investigate in this report and below be the 5 'fast fourier transforms ffts for all of them this be what allows for the spectral width to be determine a it be from these graph that the coherence length be determine to a high level of accuracy this be then use in equation 1 and 2 to find out the spectral width the white lead do not agree with what be expect at first due to it have two peak however when the lead use in this experiment be research it be found that it be in fact a blue lead with add phosphor which add the red and green component to create the the ffts in figure 6 and 7 for the tungsten source with the two filter show more complicate shape this be because the filter only allow a specific wavelength through to the detector the yellow one clearly show a doublet also due to the way yellow light be compose of red and green peak the value for the spectral width for green and yellow filter on the tungsten source be 1.22±0.09 ×10 12 hz and 1.11±0.07 ×10 12 hz respectively in conclusion this experiment be carry out to a level where the spectral width of different light source be measure to a high enough accuracy the relationship govern the absorption of different type of radioactive particle be study the result suggest that the michelson interferometer can be use to a great extent of success a a spectrometer one area of this investigation which could be improve be the effect of background light on the interferograms while it would not have be possible to take reading in complete darkness this experiment could have be optimise by ensure that the background light be constant during reading and lamp be n't be constantly switch on and off furthermore the sensitivity of the stage be the big limitation to this experiment a the fourier transforms lose much of their accuracy,extended,bal

single estimate of the wavelength at 580.3±17.3nm i nterferometry be one of the most powerful technique available to modern physicist with a standard apparatus this technique allows distance measurement of the order of a few nanometre 2 when use with monochromatic high-frequency laser and appropriate optical element the resolution achieve by an interferometer exceeds any other technique 3 in 2014 a shrink in the space-time fabric of 10 −18 m due to the collision of two black hole be make by the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ligo this detection lead to the discovery of gravitational wave 2 4 however any apparatus be only a good a it weak component whose quality be often limited by it price in a teach laboratory for example resource be limited and obviously ligo 's level of precision be completely out of reach for any laboratory with a university-sized budget yet it be possible within a certain limit to correct for systematical error induced by faulty equipment this paper will investigate how to increase the precision of an interferometer without increase the price by consider how the accuracy of it less reliable component -a v-408 pimag linear stage-can be increase the experiment relies on the interference of two coherent beam of light the analysis of the interference of the beam be make by vary the path difference between the beam by slowly move one of the mirror from which the light reflect the intensity of the result beam a a function of the path difference of the beam be then collect and analyse if the path difference be an integer multiple of the wavelength then the interference be constructive and the intensity observe be maximal for a path difference equal to an half-integer multiple of the wavelength the interference be destructive and the light have minimal intensity 5 for a give setup it be very useful to define the null point this corresponds to the position of the move mirror such that the path difference be zero between the two beam 6 ideally the null point should lie at the centre of the stage to allow the large range of motion -and hence data collection-around the null point when the move mirror be at the null point all wavelength present in the source interfere constructively with one another example of interference pattern can be see in fig 1. it be possible to extract the different frequency present in a light source from it interferogram assume the law of superposition and that the electric field be a real quantity it can be show that this process involves a fourier transform of the form 7 where b σ be the flux density correspond to the wave number σ i r δ be the flux of light a a function of δ -the path difference between the two beams-and i r 0 be the flux of light measure when the move mirror be at the null point apply equ 1 to an interferogram reveals the wavelength λ correspond to wavenumbers σ 2π λ present in the light source 7 upon collect data it be very important tomake the interference pattern visible a few data point have to be record within a period of the wave to insure fidelity to the analog signal and to minimize sample effect 6 for a stage travel at speed s and a detector collect data at a frequency f the distance travel by the stage between two record point be accord to the nyquist theorem a discrete signal contains all the information of an analog signal if the sample frequency f s be great than half of the high frequency present in the analog signal the correspond equation be 8 be f max be the high frequency present in the source 's light note that for a monochromatic electromagnetic wave the only frequency f max present in the signal be related to the wavelength λ by f max c λ rearrange eq 3 one can find the maximal distance between consecutive point in the sample such that the discrete signal complies with nyquist 's sample theorem combine this with eq 2 we find the high speed s max at which the stage can travel so that the record signal be akin to the analogous signal use the follow equation be f be the sample frequency and λ be the light 's wavelength the set-up use corresponds to a michelson interferometer and be base on thorlab 's edu-mint2 kit 2,6 the source use in this experiment be a green laser of wavelength 533 ± 1nm experimentally verify and a mercury lamp with a yellow filter the light be divide by the beamsplitter and reflect by two mirror one fix and the another attach to a computer control move stage before be re-combined and measure by the detector a picture of the set-up can be see in fig 2. when use the green laser the yellow filter be remove and the mercury lamp exchange for the green laser fix to a convex lens the laser be directly fix to the arm of the beamsplitter to ensure that the alignment and the amount of light receive be optimal the mirror be carefully align face the appropriate side of the beamsplitter so that the two path be perpendicular the set up be construct so that the light hit each mirror a close to it centre a possible to reduce any error due to potential curvature of these mirror the move stage use be the v-408 pimag linear stage accord to the data sheet it minimum incremental motion be 20nm 9 the detector use be a silicon pin photodiode model sfh 2200 which be most efficient between wavelength of 400nm and 1000 nm 10 the sample frequency of the detector use be 50hz which implies by eq 4 that all measurement have to be do with a stage move slow than 13.3µm.s −1 for high accuracy the speed of the stage be set between 2µm.s −1 and 0.1 µm.s −1 because of the sample frequency this corresponds distance between consecutive point of 2nm to 40nm this low bound be chosen to investigate how much the stage movement be affected by it speed be slow than the recommend limit a second factor for choose this range of speed be the time constraint one of the aim of this set-up be to estimate the spectrum of light emit by various source an easy way to estimate the mean wavelength of a signal be to manually measure the distance between the node in the interferogram the mean distance between the node be equal to half of the mean wavelength 11 measure the mean distance between node in the interferogram for mercury light with a yellow filter yield wavelength of 583.5 ± 31.0nm for accuracy the period measure be take roughly uniformly along the interferogram this method be quite inaccurate due to subjectivity in the location of the node and it be expect that the compute calculation of the wavelength present in fig 3. should be more precise and more accurate the spread in estimate wavelength for this preliminary data be approximately 40nm and it mean value be 580.33 ± 17.25nm this value be well in agreement with the manually measure value and be much more precise however the 2.97 error on this measurement be large for a high precision interferometer and a good proportion of line in atomic spectrum can not be correctly discern with such a high error 12 the pattern that arises in fig 3c could imply a error due to the position of the stage theoretically the value of the calculate wavelength should be indeed independent of the stage 's position if the latter move uniformly and return correctly the value of it position the estimate wavelength should also be independent of the stage 's speed assume this obeys eq 4 compare result with other group and other set of data indicate that this pattern arose in any set of data and that this error could potentially affect all the motor stage it be therefore decide to investigate this phenomenon and the green laser be chosen over the other source for quantitative analysis because it light be close to monochromatic and have a know wavelength a mention in the previous section a recognizable pattern appear when fitting the wavelength a show in fig 3c the estimation of the wavelength seem to be dependant on position of the stage figure 4 show the superposition of these pattern for run do over the same range but at different speed with the green laser qualitatively it be quite straightforward to see that the pattern be independent of the speed of the stage it be important to note that run do at 2µm.s −1 correspond to a distance between sample of 40nm displayed the same pattern a set of data do with sample distance of 15nm 6nm and 2nm the hypothesis that the stage 's limit distance between sample be 20nm a state on it data sheet can therefore be seriously doubt for reference the wavelength of this pattern be measure a 79.4±10.7µm secondly it be important to ensure that the observe pattern be only due to the stage and not the source use figure 5 present the estimation of the source 's mean wavelength a a function of the stage 's position for the green laser and the mercury lamp with a yellow filter it should be notice that the be present in both data set but only shift vertically this be completely expect since the green laser have a mean wavelength of 533nm whereas the yellow filter use with the mercury lamp only transmits light of wavelength between 567.3nm and 592.7nm 13 figure 5 hint that the fault in the stage affect the precision of the result but not their accuracy calculate the mean wavelength and standard deviation of each set of wavelength give 534.92 ± 16.68nm for the green laser and 580.33 ± 17.25nm for the mercury lamp finally the data set present in fig 4 and 5 be collect over the period of a few day during which the stage have be remove and put back into the system the stage 's error can not therefore be explain by a faulty fix of the stage to it support to account for the error cause by the stage it be chosen to base the correction on a single set of reference data collect with the green laser the position be then adjust for the calculate wavelength to match the accepted value a accurately and a precisely a possible the parameter of this correction be then use for correct any set of overlap data a the error be dependent only on the position of the stage the hypothesis chosen for the fitting be that the record position lag behind the true position by a scale factor this hypothesis be in line with the data take but it physical explanation be still unclear to correct this the program function with a small section of the sample correspond to a few period of the interferogram a sinusoidal function be then fit to this data and the optimization parameter be save because the position be record after the correspond data the wavelength of the signal be modify the correction of the position follow a scale equation where x the correct position of the signal be give by where x be the uncorrected position λ laser be the know value of wavelength of the test run λ f itted be the wavelength calculate for this small section of data point x p corr be the first uncorrected point of this section of data and x 0 be the last correct point of the previous section of point a the parameter x p corr λ f itted and x 0 be save it be then simple to correct any point by apply the correction give in eq 5 with the fitting parameter correspond to the region of space in which this specific point lie result of these fit be present in the next section multiple test be undertaken to verify the validity of the calculate correction 1 test with the green laser firstly set of data take with the green laser a the source over the same range of distance but at different speed be correct use the fitting parameter calculate from another set of data take again over the same range and in the same direction plot show the calculate wavelength for the same set of data correct and uncorrected set be present in fig 6. from this plot it be clear that • the beating in the plot of wavelength against the position be remove • the mean error in wavelength be 4.94nm which be low than the mean error for the unfitted data set which be 16.73nm in average • the mean of the wavelength be approximately equal to that in the unfitted case from these observation we can infer that the fit be efficient a it improves precision but conserve the accuracy it be useful to mention that the team suspect the quality of the sample take a reference influence the quality of the correct data 2 test with the mercury lamp it be verify that the systematic error be independent of the source in section iii it be therefore acceptable to infer that the correction calculate from the green laser 's data should be applicable to any set of data acquire over the same range it be especially useful to increase the resolution of the spectrum when work with source have emission ray separate by only a few nanometre for example mercury have a singlet line at 546.074 nm and a doublet at 576.959 nm and 579.065 nm 1 since it be show that the wavelength could vary by more than 40nm for the unfitted data set and since it be expect that the periodicity in the stage 's error alters the signal it seem impossible to resolve the line of mention above without a proper correction of the systematical error figure 7 present the distribution of the wavelength of the mercury light with a yellow filter in the fit and unfitted case it be very straightforward to see that the fit data be not only more precise but also more accurate than the unfitted data fig 7 comparison of the distribution of the calculate wavelength for the mercury light with a yellow filter the set of data use a reference for fit be a run make at 1µm.s −1 with the green laser over the same range the two line in the fit data have a wavelength of 530.9nm and 577.5nm and have a standard deviation of 2.4nm and 3.5nm respectively figure 7 show that the correction greatly improves the accuracy and precision of the signal the unfitted data spread from 630nm to 544nm the fit data on the other hand present two clear peak in the wavelength at 530.19 ± 2.4nm and 577.5 ± 3.5nm it should be mention that both the original and correct data set present wavelength small than 567.3nm which should not be the case if the yellow filter be properly use this anomaly be outside the scope of this study but could be investigate to estimate the overall accuracy of the set-up and analysis method use if the first line in the correct data be quite far from the expect value at 546.07nm 12 the second line corresponds nearly exactly to the mean between the wavelenghs of mercury 's doublet at 576.96nm and 579.07nm this second line contains both wavelength within it margin of error this experiment be affected by many source of error we have already mention the fault in the stage 's position record which be the big source of systematic error however this experiment be also affected by random error and other systematical error table i summarises the different source of error their magnitude and the mean by which the latter can be reduce unless state otherwise the magnitude of the error be give a their contribution to the wavelength 's standard deviation for the green laser correct the position use a test run with a laser of know wavelength a present above vibration more data be require but assume small because of large number of measurement do the experiment in an empty laboratory screw the optical component more tightly to the optical bench align each mirror so that light reflect upon their exact centre line broadening by doppler effect ≈ 3nm 6 14 15 switch off the mercury lamp regularly to allow cool down curvature of the mirror modify the path difference ± λ 10 in path difference 16 systematical error only shift the null point line broadening by doppler effect ≈ 5nm 6 14 15 switch off the mercury lamp regularly to allow it to cool down this study be quite limited in time and there be room for many adjustment and far precision the follow be consider of interest by the team and order by importance 1 write the code that would permit computation of the fourier transform of the correct signal attempt be make use a non-uniform fourier transform program but remain unsatisfactory the construction of a uniform set of data with the proper wavelength be also attempt but the difference in fitting parameter between the different section of data introduce discontinuity in the signal 2 check the range of speed over which the pattern arises and the data can be correct compare with nyquist 's limit frequency to determine the quality of the stage 3 check if the correction can be apply to any stage of the same model or if it stage dependent 4 check if the correction be dependant of the direction of the motor or only on it position on the stage 5 modify the code create for this study to be self explanatory and for it to automatically perform correction on any set of data if provide with a set of reference data 6 investigate the relationship between the size of the section take for fitting the quality of the correct data optimize the current code accordingly 7 use a laser whose wavelength be unique and experimentally verify to construct the data of reference 8 investigate the relationship between the quality of the data use a reference and the quality of the correct data this paper prof the presence of a systematical error due to an inaccurate record of the move stage position in an interferometry experiment it present a method to correct for this error by compute a periodic scale of the position for a set of data take over a long range with a laser of know wavelength the validity of this approach be then investigate by correct various set of data with different test run this correction be very efficient a it reduces the broadening of the spectral line from ten of nanometre to a few namometres whilst keep the accuracy of the initial set of data more precisely in the case of the mercury lamp the correction make it possible to distinguish two separate peak at 530.91 ± 0.21nm and 577.51 ± 0.34nm when the non-corrected data present a band of wavelength between 630nm and 544nm approximately if this first correct wavelength be shift significantly from the accepted value of 546.07nm 1 the second ray be close to the middle of the two wavelength that compose the expect doublet at 576.959 nm and 579.065 nm 1 the correction present in this paper negate the v-408 pimag linear stage 's physical limitation allow confident use of this set-up at low speed however this work be ongoing and the code to perform the fourier transform of the correct signal be still to be complete",expert,exp
164,2ndINT_TGO908_Redacted,we use a michelson-interferometer to measure the spectral width in the frequency and wavelength domain along with wavelength of white lead blue lead a tungsten lamp and a tungsten lamp with a green filter fourier transform allows u to find the wavelength 429.5 ± 100nm 331.5 ± 30nm 574.9 ± 200nm and 513.1 ± 40nm respectively additionally the spectral width be 27.6 ± 13.1nm 4.7 ± 1.3nm 45.1 ± 3.9nm and 2.3 ± 0.8nm respectively t his experiment u the michelson-interferometer to obtain interferograms of various light source we carry out far computational analysis to get their coherence length and spectral width in 1881 albert a. michelson design the basis of a spectral interferometer in order to test for an 'aether alongside edward w. morely since the existence of this be disprove this instrument have be modify and use in relativity spectroscopy and interferometry the interferogram be a fourier transform of the light source so spectrum in different domain can be deconstruct then construct so we can obtain far information about light source this interferometer employ division of amplitude 1 a oppose to division of wavefront precise measurement of length be record use the aparatus show in the schematic in fig 1. the monochromatic plane wave from source be incident on the partially silver surface of the beam-splitter send beam to the two mirror m 1 and m 2. m 1 have an adjustable tilt whereas m 2 have an adjustable position an interference pattern form when the two beam be reflect back record by the photodiode detector.the path difference of the two beam be 2t however for an observer look from an angle θ to the normal of the mirror the path difference be actually 2dcosθ if the distance traverse by the two beam differs by an integer number of wavelength λ we expect constructive interference hence a bright fringe whereas if the distance differs by an integer multiple of λ/2 we expect destructive interference however the dielectric plate on one side of the beam-splitter cause a phase change therefore produce a dark fringe at zero path difference instead the adjustable tilt of m 1 determines the type of fringe produce when interference occurs if m 1 and m 2 be parallel it be equivalent to the source be in line with each other this cylindrical symmetry cause the characteristic circular haidinger fringe to form a show in the right diagram of fig 2. if m 1 be inclined and intersects with m 2 the straight line fringe also call fizeau fringe be distinguishable at the detector these be contour of the wedge between the first mirror and the image of the second mirror reflect in the beam-splitter however if mirror be inclined and do not intersect the resultant fringe be curve section of hyperbola 2 a show in the middle diagram of fig 2. the interferogram record a fourier transform of the spectral line shape from a frequency domain to a spatial domain in frequency space the monochromatic wave be a delta function if the source emits light with two frequency the separation of these frequency relates to the spread of the null in the sequence of bright and dark fringe on the interferogram this spread be inversely proportional to the separation of the frequency hence a wide spectral width in the spatial domain form due to a narrow spectral width in the frequency domain 3 the spectral line be a fingerprint that can be use to identify atom a it presence indicates the idea of discrete energy level the spectral line shape of a lamp be approximately gaussian where it should ideally be a dirac delta function however spectral line broadening occurs this be due to heisenberg 's uncertainty principle which state there will be an intrinsic uncertainty in the energy of photon release by an atom -a natural spread of photon energy around the spectral line that form the gaussian shape another reason for the gaussian shape can be thermal doppler broadening cause by thermal vibration of the electron which change the observe frequency a more appropriate model for spectral line be the voigtian function 3 which be define by the convolution of a gaussian and lorentzian function we use the linux operating system to simulate the output expect from a light source with a specify width of the gaussian profile and an arbitrary intensity this simulation corroborate the theory that broadening the spectral line width in frequency domain narrow the separation of the null point in the interferogram and this be depict in fig 3. furthermore we use the the program to simulate interferograms with white blue and green light source a portrayed in fig 4. the spatial width of the white light simulation be much narrower than both blue and green light this occurs a there be a large range of frequency present in the white light spectrum whereas the range of wavelength for blue and green light be small fast fourier transforms ffts be perform on these interferograms obtain from the simulation give the spectrum in wavelength domain and validate the expect wavelength for the respective light source when construct the interferometer we use a lens of focal length 24.5mm before the beam-splitter so light from the green laser focus on the it after the beam split and recombine we place a lens of focal length 100mm before the detector to diverge the laser light if multiple fringe be incident on the aperture of the detector the signal of the peak would cancel the signal of the trough make it necessary to diverge the beam the mirror m 2 be on a stage it position be control by a motor connect to the computer along with the photodiode detector the detector sample at a rate of 50hz a a default align the interferometer be one of the most important procedure a the quality of data depends on it to ensure the interferometer align well we checked for constructive interference a large distance from the detector if circular haidinger fringe be produce here then it would definitely be well-aligned at the detector we use the green laser a a tool to find the null point the position of m 2 where t 0. when the stage be move slowly the fringe appear or disappear from the centre depend on whether we scan away or towards the null point meaning the null point be situate where the fringe change direction then scan through with a white lead confirm this range to be 8.073 − 8.085 ± 0.0005mm we select the range of position to scan through the speed and the number of sample take depend on the expect interferogram width of the respective light source there be four light source that we characterise in this experiment white lead blue lead white tungsten light and white tungsten light with a green filter another point to note about the tungsten lamp when the fit function be apply the fit wavelength belong in the infrared region hence it can be model a a black body emitter use wein 's displacement law the temperature t have a value of 5040 ± 1000k this be the correct order of magnitude for a tungsten lamp we apply ffts to the interferograms to transform them from a spatial domain to a wavelength domain this give gaussian-like shape for the distribution of the wavelength from which the average wavelength be calculate the spread of wavelength for white lead be show in fig 7. this be expect because white lead comprises blue/uv light along with yellow light from fluorescence 4 the small peak corresponds to approximately 360nm which lie in the uv range and the large peak corresponds to 500nm which be closer to the yellow range wavelength to work out the coherence length l we fit a gaussian over the interferogram and use the relationship to find the full-width half maximum fwhm which be an approximation for the coherence length of the source in order to obtain the value present in table i and table ii we take five interferograms of each of the light source this reduces the chance of anomaly in the data when the average be take the value of the error be also low because the sample size be high the error in the average wavelength arise from the analysis of the fit function and spread of the fit wavelength to the interferogram the error in the coherence length can be determine by how appropriate the gaussian fit be for an interferogram and the error in the σ value for the fit the gaussian fit best on the tungsten lamp interferogram and it be the least appropriate for the tungsten lamp with a green filter this be because the green frequency emit be close in frequency space which cause beating form the shape outside the central envelope also because the gaussian be not a good fit for the spectral line this be illustrate in fig 8. the bandwidth theorem and the relationship between the frequency bandwidth and coherence time 5 rearranges to where ∆ν be the frequency bandwidth in unit of hz this can be rearrange to calculate the spectral width in the wavelength domain also the error in table ii be calculate use propagation of error formula from the l value the white lead and white tungsten lamp have a similar spectral width in the frequency space however it differs significantly in wavelength space -showing that the tungsten lamp be more of a continuous spectrum the blue and green filter tungsten lamp have narrower spectral width a they consist of more distinct frequency hence give them large coherence length v. conclusion this experiment give the spectral width of white lead and white tungsten lamp a 27.6 ± 13.1nm and 45.1 ± 3.9nm respectively whereas for blue lead and a tungsten lamp with green filter they be 4.7 ± 1.3nm and 2.3 ± 0.8nm respectively compare this to the interferograms the reciprocity between spatial domain and frequency wavelength domain be far solidify the main source of error be most likely the limitation of the light source and stray light create noise in interferograms,superficial,the
165,2ndINT_PUK317_Redacted,a fourier transform spectrometer be construct use a michelson interferometer which produce emission spectrum for a blue and white lead and a white tungsten lamp -along with filter instance of the white light source the spectrum produce be see to be consistent with their expect value however it be determine that in order to evaluate the accuracy of this spectrometer far deeper investigation be require t he michelson interferometer be a simple optical setup comprise of a beam splitter and two mirror by allow the position of one of the mirror to be adjust this system can be use to perform fourier transform spectroscopy use this technique mean that if the output intensity of the interferometer be know a a function of the position of the moveable mirror then the wavelength spectrum of the light enter the interferometer can be determine 1 2 this system set-up will be realise use a motorise mirror and digital detector to allow automate data take for large number of data point the set-up will then collect data for multiple source in order to reconstruct their emission spectrum which will then be compare to the expect value in order to verify the behaviour of the spectrometer a beam of light from a single source can be split into two beam of equal intensity if these beam then travel along identical path before be recombine into a single beam and project onto a detector the intensity at the detector will be equal to the intensity of the original beam of light however if a difference δ path be introduce between the length of the path that the split beam travel before be recombine then it can be show that the intensity at the detector becomes where i be the intensity µ be the amplitude of the electric field for a particular wavenumber σ with σ a the average wavenumber it can be see here how the intensity be form from a superposition of the two beam which have a phase difference of 2πσδ path lead to constructive and destructive interference and that the original source be be described mathematically a a continuous weight sum over all possible wavenumbers 2 the intensity i can be easily measure if the intensity be know a a function of δ path then information about the light source can be recover from the interferogram the fig 1. a schematic diagram of the michelson interferometer use in this report the beam travel through the system be show in red the diffuser show be use in conjunction only with lead source in order to remove the structure that can be see in the beam that them emit which would otherwise lead to non-symmetric data the collimator tube increase the collimation of the light a it travel from source to beam splitter which be make of a partially silver plate and a dielectric plate within a glass block the sliver plate reflect half of incident light and transmits the other half splint light between the arm of the interferometer the dielectric plate cause a phase change of π 4 to light each time it pas through the plate result be a constant additional phase difference of π 2 between the split beam when they be recombine the focus lens converges light onto a single spot on the detector relationship between i and δ path by preform a cosine fourier transform which yield where b be the relative amplitude of a particular wavenumber within the source 's emission spectrum and a be an arbitrary constant in equ 2 b be a sum over all possible path difference up to infinity however due to the continuous nature and finite width of spectral emission line of real source in frequency space it can be see that lim due to the large amount of destructive interference that occurs therefore the contribution of large δ path element to the integral in equ 2 tends to zero and b can be approximate by take the integral form zero to a finite limit 2 iii method in order to split light beam and recombine them in a control fashion a michelson interferometer be employ a show in f ig 1 the linear motor stage that one of the mirror be mount on allows the system to scan through different value of δ path by adjust the value of t which be the offset of the mirror from the position where both interferometer arm will have an equal path length it be therefore know that t 2δ path and that t can have both positive and negative value the detector take measurement of light intensity at a constant rate of 50hz the movement speed of the linear stage be therefore tune to produce an appropriate amount of data point per oscillation in the interferogram if the visible spectrum be approximately 400−700 nm and the stage move at a velocity of 0.0016mms −1 then in the interferogram there will be between 6 and 11 data point per high frequency oscillation depend on the shortest wavelength of light present 1 the value of intensity be take for discrete step in δ path so therefore when equ 2 be implement into the analysis of the measure interferogram a discrete fourier transform be instead use this transform be handle by the scipy discrete fourier transforms package when this transform be implement the 2 term be drop because the dielectric plate present in the interferometer add a constant phase difference between the beam which result in zero intensity at the null point δ path 0 rather than the intensity be that of the original light source instead this offset will result in the spectrum of b σ have a sharp spike at σ 0 which be equivalent to a constant value in the interferogram this spike must be cut out before convert b σ into the wavelength emission spectrum along with negative value of σ which will arise from allow t and effectively therefore δ path to have positive and negative value due to the symmetry in the system it be expect that b σ b −σ 2 iv result three different light source be analyse a blue lead a white lead and a tungsten lamp the latter two source be also analyse after be subject to a yellow filter and a green filer in turn for each data take process the linear stage move 0.1mm with this movement centralise about the current null point of the system this corresponds to δ path range from −0.1mm to +0.1mm example of the observe interferograms be see in f ig 2 with the complete set of reconstruct emission spectrum show in f ig 3 the wide wavelength range produce a narrow interferogram it can be see from the emission spectrum that there be two distinct wavelength peak the expect result of this would be beating effect in the interferogram however the finite interferogram package function cause by spectral width reduces the intensity to a near constant value before this effect can become apparent the two curve in the emission spectrum peak at 441 nm and 563nm with fwhm 's of 30nm and 141nm respectively this spectral shape be an artefact of how white lead work these lead contain a single blue lead the light from this must pa though a phosphor material layer which produce longer wavelength yellow light through fluorescence 3 the spectral shape correspond to the fluorescence be naturally wider than to lead that cause it because there be effectively a convolution between the distribution of wavelength incident on the phosphor and the pre-existing distribution of electron energy within the phosphor which shape the distribution of fluoresce light the blue lead produce a wider interferogram than the two white source because the spectrum have a narrower wavelength range the interferogram be still contain within a discrete package because the spectral line be not infinity narrow the peak wavelength be 479 nm with a fwhm of 29 nm the expect wavelength be 470 nm which be consistent with the obtain result 4 a with the white lead the board range of wavelength present in tungsten light result in a narrow image on the interferogram unlike any of the other source however the recover spectrum show that there be wavelength present which lie outside of the visible range into the infra red the spectral curve peak at 788 nm with a fwhm of 278 nm it be know that a tungsten lamp produce light through thermal emission therefore by treat the tungsten a a black body it temperature can be predict use wien 's displacement law where t be the colour temperature and λ max be the peak wavelength in the emission spectrum use this the temperature of the tungsten be predict to be 3680k however the lamp be rat a have a colour temperature of 2796k from this discrepancy it can be conclude that the detector use in this set-up be not sufficient to detect a wide enough range of ir light to fully reconstruct the emission spectrum which for tungsten would be mostly in the ir the decay signal response to longer wavelength be what have cause to spectrum to appear to peak at a shorter wavelength result in a high predict value of temperature 5 it can be see that the spectral width of the filter emission spectrum be small enough that the beating effect cause by the multiple peak can be see on the interferogram before the package function reduces the intensity to a near constant the filter green and yellow filter use in this report be bandpass filter with a central wavelength of 543.5 nm and 580 nm respectively with a fwhm of 10 nm the distinct and consistent spectrum profile that both of these filter produce be therefore unexpected the size of this profile be consistent between filter and source however with a white lead source the green and yellow spectral profile be offset by ∼ 30 nm but with a tungsten source this offset increase to ∼ 50 nm this change be also unexpected and unexplained the experimental set-up have be show to able to reconstruct emission spectrum whose nature be consistent with the expect result however the accuracy of this reconstruction can not be meaningfully comment on without multiple and repeat measurement over a wider range of source in order to facilitate proper error analysis it have also be see with the tungsten lamp that this system be limited by the response of the detector to different wavelength of light meaning that for proper treatment of source which emit light outside of the visible spectrum a different detector would need to be implement this same limitation also lead to different wavelength of visible light invoke different signal response from the detector to produce accurate emission spectrum this effect must be understood though far experimentation so that it can be account for the consistent emission profile of filter source that be found in this report demonstrate that this set-up be capable of produce repeatable data however the shape and position of these profile be not explain the linear stage velocity that be use to collect data be found to be satisfactory throughout 2 for a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten lamp -listed top to bottom the plot for the white source also include the spectrum of these source when subject green and yellow filter show in their respective colour these filter spectrum be show at the correct relative height to each other but be actually much less intense compare to the unfiltered source than be show the amplitude between plot be also not

166,2ndINT_CYF541_Redacted,we investigate the spectrum of tungsten and mercury by use an interferometer to find the intensity of the light source this be do by arrange the different component of the interferometer to obtain an interference pattern of the light source and hence an amplify intensity we then use the fourier transform to find the spectrum of the source in wavelength space the temperature of tungsten be t 3199±446 k. we observe deviation from the expect black body radiation curve and hence analysis of the detector and beam splitter sensitivity be incorporate in order to obtain a more accurate curve furthermore for mercury we saw four main peak in the visible range which correspond to four discrete transition the spectrum however be very noisy and hence upon add a magnetic field we saw slight variation for the wavelength transition the study of spectrum have be a key element in develop our understand of different phenomenon range from the reaction occur in star to discreet atomic transition govern by quantum mechanical process 1 it be one of the major method use to observe matter in general context spectroscopy be the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation in the case of this experiment where we study the spectrum of different light source the main phenomenon govern the process be emission of photon due to atomic transition when atom move between high and low energy state they emit a photon hence in frequency or wavelength space the `` peak `` or the continuous spectrum fundamentally be due to these atomic transition of the source 2 in this experiment we study the spectrum of several light source and obtain the fourier transform of the source to observe it spectrum this be do by find the null point in the interferometer set-up which indicates the position of maximum intensity the two main aspect of the experiment study be the investigation of the black body radiation of tungsten 3 and the zeeman effect in mercury in the study of tungsten incorporate the effect of the detector and beam splitter be need in order to obtain the appropriate curve describe black body radiation in the case of mercury the same procedure be follow to obtain the spectrum to study the zeeman effect we add a magnet to our source we thus theoretically expect the energy level to split and hence see a split in the spectral line interference be the main phenomenon govern the process of this experiment the interferometer be set in a way to allow incoming beam from the light source to interfere constructively see method section the condition for constructive interference be where d be the separation between the interfere beam θ be the angle between them m an integer and λ be the wavelength of the light source the intensity of the wave be obtain use a photodiode and the record plot be an intensity versus distance plot the distance in this case represent the distance from the null point point where the intensity be a maximum in order to obtain the spectrum of the consider source we have to fast fourier transform the signal record by the inteferogram this be do by approximate the intensity signal in `` distance space `` to a set of discrete signal effectively this be give by where x k and x n be the amplitude in wavelength and distance space n be the number of sample consider and the exponential part represent the incoming transform wave in this experiment the incoming signal be gaussians which would in turn give gaussians a spectrum in wavelength space the expression look similar to the fourier series but the variable be different in this case 3 the spectrum of tungsten corresponds to a black body mainly because it emits electromagnetic radiation at all frequency therefore theoretically the intensity of radiation be give by planck 's law where i be the intensity a a constant h and c planck 's constant and the speed of light in vacuum 4 use this relation we can find the temperature of the tungsten law by the follow relation where t be the temperature and λ max be the peak wavelength of the spectrum and b be a constant of proportionality however the beam be affected by two main aspect both the beam splitter use and the detector have sensitivity towards wavelength we thus have two consider take those effect into account the follow plot show the sensitivity therefore in order to obtain the black body spectrum of the tungsten lamp source we should divide the output signal we observe by the above two contribution 5 the spectrum of mercury be different than the other lamp source use since the emission occur at specific wavelength rather than a range of wavelength in the visible region there be 4 wavelength correspond to the four emission at 405 nm 436 nm and 546 nm 579 nm thus theoretically we expect our spectrum to be comprise of 4 delta function centre around the above wavelength a simulation of the data provide a well visualisation of the above case an interest phenomenon occurs upon place the mercury in a magnetic field the energy level of the atomic spectrum of mercury split and hence the peak show in the spectrum split a well in theoretical context the magnetic field add can be thought of a a perturbation to the energy level of mercury atom the value of this perturbation be give by where b be the apply magnetic field µ b be the `` bohr magneton `` m j be the spin quantum number and g j be a constant related to the quantum number describe this system therefore the simulation above would be modify to include the energy level splitting a follow fig 3 simulation of the expect spectrum of mercury lamp upon apply a magnetic field a we can see in figure 3 the energy level of the mercury atom split far and thus we expect to see the emission of more wavelength 6 throughout this experiment the same experimental procedure be follow a schematic of the experimental set-up provide a well understand of the procedure follow the main aim behind the built set-up show in figure 4 be to allow the beam of light come from the desire light source to constructively interfere and hence give a point of maximum intensity light arrives from the source at the beam splitter where it be `` divide `` into two beam go to the two mirror which then interfere and the interfere wave arrives at the detector which measure the intensity of this signal when the distance between the two mirror be exactly the same the beam interfere constructively to give maximum intensity this be the position of the null point in practice find the null point manually be very difficult and thus mirror 2 have a motor which adjusts it position in other word it be enough to find the range of the null point and not the exact position once the range be obtain we can scan the motor and thus have a spectrum of the source at distance before and after the null point the next step be fourier transform the data in order to obtain the spectrum in frequency space for tungsten the same procedure be follow and in order to obtain a well curve describe the black body radiation spectrum we have to divide the output signal by the sensitivity of both the beam splitter and the detector the data-sheet of the beam splitter contain value of the different point we have to multiply and hence divide the output signal by that be relatively easy for the detector the data-sheet only contain a curve represent the value we therefore use mathmatica in order to extract the data by plot a grid which allows u to get the coordinate of the data point therefore take both contribution into account we obtain the spectrum of tungsten for mercury the additional step we conduct be place the lamp inside a magnet in order to observe the zeeman effect we can see from the above figure that upon add the contribution of the detector and beam splitter we get a black body spectrum the maximum wavelength of the spectrum be λ max 878 ± 26 nm and thus use equation 4 the temperature of the tungsten lamp use be t 3199±446 k. the plot with error bar be represent in b since the number of data point be relatively high and hence the plot would be messy and the difference between the curve with and without the sensitivity would not be clearer the error in our result be due to statistical error of run the motor several time and due to `` noise `` of our data more discussion in section v we obtain the spectrum of mercury with and without apply a magnetic field accord to equation 5 we except the peak to split into far different wavelength the result be summarise below a the spectrum of mercury when no magnetic field be apply b the spectrum of mercury when a magnetic field be apply fig 6 two plot show the difference between the spectrum of mercury when a magnetic field be apply figure 6 show the difference in the spectrum of mercury when a magnetic field be apply to the mercury lamp although we can see difference in the shape of the spectrum there be a lot of noise to differentiate between actual splitting of energy level or just random noise the value of the wavelength for the mercury spectrum be 411 ± 19 nm 447 ± 14 nm and 547 ± 12 nm 576 ± 25nm the value obtain along with their error lie within the range of the accepted theoretical value and value obtain by simulation which be 405 nm 436 nm and 546 nm 579 nm concern error the source of error be the same a the one use for tungsten the source of error be statistical due to measure several number of data set and noise in our experiment see appendix for plot with error bar since it make visualise the difference harder for the first part of the experiment the main experimental result be calculate the temperature of tungsten lamp the value obtain be t 3199 ± 446 k. this value along with it error lie within the accepted value of the temperature which be t 2796 k 7 accord to the lamp data-sheet we can see that the expect black body spectrum of tungsten be not quite obtain when directly plot the intensity in the experiment this be mainly due to the way the equipment use receives the incoming light upon find the sensitivity of the beam splitter use in the set-up and the detector we can see that the spectrum be improve and look more like a black body in particular we can see that after the peak the spectrum decay in a way that corresponds to the exponential part show in equation 3 however we can also see that there be still slight difference between the spectrum obtain and the theoretical spectrum of a black body the difference observe can be explain by several factor the way the sensitive be multiply possibly explains these difference a function be not provide for the sensitivity of the detector and therefore numerical method be use to obtain the data point and thus manually multiply the experimental point with these sensitivity the drawback of the method use be that only a limited number of data point be found compare to the large data set and therefore the variation show be for few data point than the one use in the experiment see appendix a for more detail on the method use to extract the point concern the error of the experiment two main source of error be identify the first source of error be the noise present in the experiment around the null point relatively far from the null point we except to see destructive interference thus the small value of intensity be assume to be noise and hence be take into account into the error calculation furthermore a second source of error be statistical to the way data-sets be take in order to improve the accuracy of our result we take 4 or 5 independent data set of every light source therefore a standard deviation and a mean be obtain for individual point which thus introduce a statistical error for the second part of the experiment the wavelength of the mercury spectrum be 411 ± 19 nm 447 ± 14 nm and 547 ± 12 nm 576 ± 25nm the obtain value along with their error lie within the range of the know value the main thing to notice about the spectrum be the relatively low resolution of the measurement this in turn make it hard to actually distinguish between peak and noise in other word although the above measure value be the high peak we can clearly see that there be several other peak this therefore also implies that see actual clear difference when apply the magnetic field be hard a well we can see slight difference in the two plot in figure 6 in particular we can see more peak in the plot show the magnetic field however extract data and numerical difference be relatively difficult to obtain due to the low resolution present several step can be follow in the future to improve the resolution of the plot the major one would be to investigate the behaviour of the motor in detail since it be probably the main factor responsible for the resolution in particular a plot of the distance cover by the motor a a function of time can be consider to see if the motor move in the expect way furthermore the fast fourier transform can be modify to see if this affect the resolution we try however to modify this by use a different method to what be use for the other spectrum the result be not very different from the one obtain and hence modify the way of the fourier transform be not likely to affect the resolution a lot the source of error in the second part of the experiment be calculate in the same way a the tungsten lamp for both part although the calculate quantity be within the range of the expect value there be a possibility of the existence of systematic error the equipment and the detector be very sensitive to any change of distance or light intensity and hence external source of error might have be present in the experiment in order to reduce these source we try to make sure before start to take measurement that the distance be the same and that the lid cover the apparatus be properly on to avoid vary the light intensity in this experiment two main experimental result be obtain the temperature of a tungsten lamp source be calculate to be t 3199 ± 446 k. this result be obtain by take into account the both the detector and beam splitter sensitivity when measure the intensity of the tungsten lamp source in the second part of the experiment we obtain peak wavelength of mercury at 411 ± 19 nm 447 ± 14 nm and 547 ± 12 nm 576 ± 25nm upon introduce the magnetic field we expect accord to the zeeman effect to see energy level splitting and hence several other peak the major drawback however be that the resolution of our spectrum be low and hence differentiate between peak or general noise be relatively difficult several possible extension be interest to far investigate in this experiment for the first part improve the numerical method use to take into account the sensitivity of the detector and beam splitter would provide to be useful to well improve the black body spectrum of tungsten for the second part the major extension would be to investigate the resolution of the interferograms in order to improve the spectrum of the mercury lamp this in turn would provide an improve resolution when compare the data with the magnetic field apply to the mercury lamp in brief the method use to extract the point consists of plot the graph on mathmatica and then plot small grid line which enable u to find the coordinate of the point an example below provide a visualisation of how the method work thus after find the point a scalar multiplication be do to the experimental data point to obtain a new fit the plot below show the mercury spectrum with error bard the plot be not place in the result section since the resolution of the mercury spectrum be low and the error bard make the plot more messy,extended,none
167,2ndINT_FTZ138_Redacted,"michelson interferometer be use to characterise three light source a blue lead white lead and heat tungsten filament radiate a a blackbody an interferogram and wavelength spectrum for each be found and the source characterise by it peak wavelength and spectral width the blue lead be found to have a peak wavelength of 453±2 nm and a spectral width of 10.9 ± 0.1 nm the white lead be found to contain two distinct peak the first of which be found to be similar to the blue lead a it peaked around 443 ± 1 nm with a spectral width of 10.7 ± 0.1 nm the second peak be broader and found at a high wavelength of 559 ± 2 nm with a spectral width of 72.7 ± 3 nm the data for the tungsten source disagreed with theory and be not fit accord to a blackbody but instead a gaussian the peak wavelength be found to be 802 ± 0.8 nm with a spectral width of 125 ± 1 nm this be use to find the characteristic temperature of the source to be 3.62 × 10 3 ± 3.6 k. t he michelson interferometer be an extremely useful tool in spectroscopy a it allows the analysis of high frequency light wave without the need for extremely high frequency detector the interferometer be first use by michelson and morley in the late 1800s to prove the existence of an `` aether `` that propagates the universe 1 though this be found to not be the case it have since be adapt to act a a spectrometer by obtain interference pattern interferograms of light source which encode information about the wavelength of the light use this information can then be extract through a fourier transform of the interferogram the mechanism responsible for the emission of light can then be consider after analyse the wavelength spectrum give an insight into the energy transition occur in the material this have far-reaching application from it first use a a spectrometer in 1949 to analyse astrophysical data to the solid state physic govern the semiconductor lead common in day-to-day life this experiment aim to characterise several light source white and blue lead and a heat tungsten source by determine the general feature of their wavelength spectrum notably the mean wavelength and spectral width a the tungsten source be a blackbody radiator this peak wavelength can then be use to determine the temperature of the source in this experiment the michelson interferometer concern two beam from the same source so that they have the same characteristic frequency and constant phase difference between them i.e they be coherent the two beam be form from a single beam which be pas through a beamsplitter a partiallysilvered mirror orientate 45 • to the incident beam splitting it into two perpendicular beam each beam be reflect off a mirror whose normal be along the direction of propagation a set distance from the splitter so that they recombine and then be image onto a screen or detector this be illustrate in fig 1 2 subtle difference in the distance travel by each beam form interference fringe where the resultant amplitude be the sum of the amplitude of each wave the interference of two coherent wave can be express mathematically 2 by consider two wave propagate in time and space with equal wave-vector k frequency ω and amplitude a 0 with a phase difference between them of δ by the principle of superposition the amplitude of the combine wave be the sum of the amplitude of the original wave furthermore by define the intensity of the wave a the square of it amplitude if each wave have intensity i 0 so that a 0 .a 0 i 0 it be found that so that this be a basic interference pattern where the cosine term produce the light and dark fringe described by a general formula depend on some phase between the wave which can be found for certain situation it can be show 2 that for a monochromatic point source the phase difference between two beam in a michelson interferometer be give by where λ be the monochromatic wavelength of the light and x be twice the difference in length between each mirror and the beam splitter this be the case for θ 0 in fig 1 it can be see then that a peak in intensity occurs whenever δ be equal to an integer multiple of 2π note that this be not the periodicity of the fringe see on the screen but how the fringe change when translate the mirror now consider the original beam to consist of a continuum of wavenumbers with a spectrum so that e e v the interferogram f x show the relation between the intensity at a point on the screen and the difference in path length be give by the constant in the formula refers to an offset which can be remove far simplification include define the interferogram and spectrum to be even about x and v 0 respectively which lead to hence it be show that interferogram and wavenumber spectrum which be easily convert to a wavelength spectrum of a light source form a fourier pair because the wavelength spectrum of an lead source may be roughly gaussian discus in section ii-b it can be predict that the interferogram will also be a gaussian with a width inversely related to the width of the wavelength spectrum this width be define a the coherence length of the source and be centre around the null point when the distance between each mirror and the beamsplitter be equal fig 1 2 a schematic for a michelson interferogram a source s 0 be split use a beamsplitter b and reflect off mirror at position m 1 and m 2 m 1 be variable so that when the distance between each mirror and the splitter be equal m 1 be situate at m 2 the distance between m 1 and this position be d. the fringe produce on the screen be due to the path difference between each beam the wavelength peak in the blue region of the spectrum be due to the extrinsic semiconductor aspect of the lead the material can be described a an extrinsic semiconductor where charge carrier can occupy discrete state in energy level accord to a dispersion relation charge carrier can be either electron or hole the latter be an absence of an electron and a simple dispersion relation 3 show the allow energy level be show in fig 2 where the low band be the valence band and the upper be the conduction band the semiconductor be described a extrinsic because impurity have be add in order to increase the charge carrier density by increase the electron density in one region and increase the hole density in another recombination in the conduction band can be encourage in order to cause the carrier to drop to a low energy level in the valence band and emit a photon because carrier in the conduction band can have a range of energy and drop to a range of energy in the valence band the distribution of emit wavelength be likely to follow a gaussian around a peak wavelength with a spectral width related to the number of allow energy in each band a typical dispersion relation be not compose of single parabolic valence and conduction band fig 2 3 a simple dispersion relation in a semiconductor material the low band be the valence band the upper be the conduction band and the line label e f be the fermi energy charge carrier populate state in each band and their movement from one to another cause the material to absorb or emit energy although a gaussian be fit to the interferogram and the wavelength spectrum the tungsten wavelength spectrum be not described theoretically by a gaussian function a the mechanism for emission do not concern discrete energy level instead the emission can be explain by consider the statistical mechanic of a simplification of the system a a cavity at constant temperature contain a photon gas 4 the distribution of photon state be give by the bose-einstein distribution with a chemical potential of 0 and the density of state found by impose orthogonality condition upon the wavevectors of the photon from this the planck 's radiation law 4 for blackbody radiator can be found express in equation 6 in term of wavelength λ from this it can be show that the temperature of the blackbody radiator be related to the peak wavelength be related to the peak wavelength by equation 7 4 where b be wein 's displacement constant with a numerical value of 2.90 × 10 −3 mk the experiment described in fig 1 be setup on an optical table with opaque plastic black wall and lid to reduce signal noise a coarse measurement of the distance between each mirror and the beamsplitter be make use a standard ±1 mm ruler to ensure that the null point be within the range of the stage a monochromatic green laser be then use to make fine adjustment to the angular alignment of the mirror the reflect beam off the mirror be project onto white card at far distance and the beamsplitter and mirror m 1 be adjust until the two beam be centre at the same point so that circular heidinger fringe be see a 100 mm lens be use to expand the beam before enter the beamsplitter and a 25 mm lens use after recombination to image the beam onto the detector after alignment the null point be found use a white lead it can be predict that the white lead have a broad spectrum so it coherent length be low enough for a welldefined peak to be see at the null point this data be take by move the stage at it low speed of 0.001 mm s −1 a the detector sample at a frequency of 50 hz this provide a theoretical distance between each sample of 20 nm this be also use a a preliminary test to ensure the gain of the detector and speed of the stage be appropriate the latter of which concern nyquist 's theorem for sample periodic analog signal after the null point be observe interferograms over a large range at the same stage speed be obtain with each source allow the coherence length of the source to be found operating a discrete fast fourier transform upon this data produce a frequency spectrum however several consideration need to be make here firstly the fourier transform of the interferogram require the distance between each sample dsamp althought this be assume to be a constant value of 20 nm plot a histogram of dsamp for each data-point produce a gaussian centre at 18.4 nm label µ with a width σ of 11.9 nm a show in fig 3 the mean distance be use to plot the wavelength spectrum although this show that there be a very large uncertainty in dsamp it be hard to quantify how this affect the uncertainty in the wavelength initially the width be to be use to find an uncertainty in the wavelength by plot the wavelength spectrum use value for dsamp of µ−σ for the low bound and µ σ for the upper however this lead to an extremely large shift in the wavelength spectrum and so be deem an inappropriate measure of uncertainty the second consideration be that the spectral sensitivity of the detector be not uniform across all wavelength this be quantify in fig 4 5 because the spectrum be not fig 3. a histogram of the distance move by a motorise stage after receive a command to move 20 nm a gaussian curve be fit to the histogram with a mean value of 18.4 nm and width of 11.9 nm the data be consist of 84,996 point sort into 1,000 bin express by a function or data array it be approximate to 4 linear region provide a value between 0 and 1. this provide a coarse method for correction after a wavelength spectrum be found by divide by the relative sensitivity of the detector at that wavelength it be assume that the detector be only accurate within this range and so any signal outside it be discard this mean that the spectrum be truncate to only include wavelength in the 400 to 1100 nm range however the gaussian for a monochromatic wavelength will be far small than this and will have some noise and fluctuation due to experimental error because of this there be some subjectivity in choose the wavelength range to consider when isolate the gaussian peak which will have an effect on the parameter extract because the uncertainty in wavelength due to this effect be difficult to quantify the uncertainty in each value be take to be the statistical uncertainty in the parameter use to fit the data fig 4 5 the spectral sensitivity of the osram sfh 2200 detector use to measure the intensity of light interferogram this be use to correct the wavelength spectrum obtain from the interferogram of each source a. lead source 1 blue lead the blue lead source be investigate first a the source be predict to be monochromatic so should produce a single gaussian both in the interferogram and the wavelength spectrum a ground diffuser be fix to the beamsplitter and the source place before it so that it be emit through the centre of the diffuser and parallel to it axis though this be not quantify a long interferogram be take which be show in fig 5 a gaussian fit be also plot find the coherence length to be 15.5 × 10 −7 m. the fourier transform of this data be present with a gaussian fit in fig 6. the blue lead be found to have a peak wavelength of 453 ± 2 nm and a spectral width of 10.9 ± 0.1 nm fig 6. the wavelength spectrum of a blue lead solid blue line the central peak be around 453 nm with a width of 10.9 nm these value be extract from the gaussian fit give by the dash orange line 2 white lead the same experimental setup be use for the white lead source to produce the interferogram in fig 7 and the wavelength spectrum in fig 8. it be see that the interferogram can be fit use two gaussian envelope of differ width and amplitude without any significant beating imply that two distinct wavelength be present in the source this be see in the wavelength spectrum where the two peak be see a the coherence length be inversely related to the spectral width peak 1 orange can be identify to have a coherence length of 13.6 × 10 −6 m and corresponds to the wavelength peak at 443 ± 1 nm with a spectral width of 10.7 ± 0.1 nm peak 2 red have a coherence length of 0.6 × 10 −6 m and corresponds to the broader wavelength peak at 559 ± 2 nm and spectral width of 72.7 ± 3 nm it can be see then that the blue lead have one predominant wavelength correspond to one allow transition at relatively high energy and low width whereas the white lead contains two main transition one at a similar energy and width to the transition in the blue lead and a second transition at a low energy with a high band width this be because the second transition red at low energy do not occur by the mechanism above but instead through fluorescence some of the emit blue and high energy light be absorbed by a doped phosphor coat which have a transition that emits at a high wavelength a typical phosphor use be yttrium aluminium garnet a crystal of y 3 al 15 o 12 doped use a metallic element 6 it be the element use here that determines the peak wavelength and spectral width b. tungsten 1 numerical result a sample of tungsten filament be heat so that it undergoes blackbody emission the same procedure a in section iv-a be carry out and the interferogram be give in fig 9 and wavelength spectrum in fig 10. it can be see that the interferogram contains beating at the base of the gaussian fit -with a coherence length of around 5.1 × 10 −7 m -and at far distance from the null point at around −8.817 and −8.76 ×10 −3 m this suggests the the wavelength spectrum contains a central broad gaussian peak with several narrower peak of similar wavelength this be see in the wavelength spectrum which can be fit with a gaussian centre around a wavelength of 802±0.8 nm with a spectral width of 125 ± 1 nm with what may be see a several narrow peak at the central wavelength this be an extremely broad spectrum extend beyond the visible range the significance of this be that tungsten filament be use a everyday light source despite a large portion of their emission be in the infrared region -this be extremely inefficient the tungsten wavelength spectrum have be fit here use a gaussian function however a discus in section ii-c this should be described by the planck radiation law despite this the fit qualitatively look correct and the statistical uncertainty in the fit coefficient be no large than that of the coefficient for the other source for which theory agrees should be fit with gaussian function because of this the peak wavelength can still be extract from the plot and use to find the temperature characterise the filament source use equation 7 and a value of 802 nm for the peak wavelength the temperature of the source be calculate to be 3.62 × 10 3 k. use the error propagation forumla and take a value of uncertainty in peak wavelength of 0.8 nm the uncertainty in temperature be calculate to be ±3.6 k. in conclusion this experiment realise the goal of characterise several different type of light source however far improvement could be make firstly a way of negate the non-constant value of dsamp would be to carry out the fourier transform in such a way that the step size of the x-axis be not constant if this be not possible then a well way of quantify the uncertainty and relate it to the uncertainty in the wavelength spectrum could be found this be important a the uncertainty in the coefficient be relatively small be on the order of 1 secondly the correction for the spectral sensitivity of the detector could be well calculate if a data-set be found so that the plot would not have to be approximate to linear portion furthermore the correction could be carry out a a convolution though the method use be sufficient finally the plot for the tungsten source do not agree with theory a a blackbody fit could not be fit to it a the reason for this inaccuracy have not be found the apparatus should have be partly dismantle and thoroughly checked before take several more data-sets",superficial,the
168,2ndINT_DAG780_Redacted,the investigation cover in this report be carry out in order to verify and study the use of fouriertransform spectroscopy through construct and use a michelson interferometer the coherence length and wavelength of different type of light source be measure the blue lead and white tungsten light have peak wavelength of 464.98 nm and 751.30 nm respectively whereas the white lead have three peak at 454.71 nm 571.46 nm and 606.44 nm and these be close to the true value he study and analysis of light spectrum know a spectroscopy have be crucial in physic for the development of many fundamental theory throughout history due to the information that the spectrum can provide about atomic structure and energy profile in the modern day spectroscopic technique be utilized in nearly all area of physic traditionally spectroscopy involve measure specific wavelength of a spectrum by separate it out use a device such a a monochromator -the dispersive method the entire spectrum could then be measure by splitting it up into a number of spectral element and measure the wavelength for each one the intensity of each wavelength of light would correspond to the amount of that particular wavelength present in the spectrum more recently a type of spectroscopy know a fouriertransform spectroscopy have grown in popularity whereby the desire light spectrum can be retrieve by apply a fourier transform operation to measurement of the temporal coherence of the light source the rapid increase in it application be largely due to the development make in compute technology that have allow the mathematical analysis involve to be perform efficiently for our experiment we would take these measurement by use a continuous wave michelson interferometer a configuration of optical device that be invent by albert a. michelson in the late 1800s it be first popularize after be an integral part of the famous michelson-morley experiment in 1887 1 which be successful in disprove the existence of the aether and eventually lead on to the research that brought about the theory of special relativity in a michelson interferometer a beam of light be direct into a beam splitter which split the light source into two perpendicular component arm of light by use a partially-silvered surface these be then reflect at two mirror and after return to the beam splitter recombine into a single beam depend on the type of interference that occurs between the two beam which be determine by their path difference an interference pattern be produce at the detector if both beam travel equal distance from the beam splitter to their respective mirror and back then they will interfere constructively and result in a bright plane wave output if instead the distance that the two beam travel with respect to each other be separate by half of their wavelength they will interfere destructively and we expect to observe no light incident on the detector in our experiment a dielectric plate be attach to one side of the beam splitter and this cause a phase change of 𝜋 for one of the beam a a result at zero path difference between the two beam there will be destructive instead of constructive interference and a dark fringe will be observe instead of a bright one the visible fringe that be observe for a give path difference between the beam be also dependent on the alignment of the two reflect mirror in the case that the two mirror be align perfectly perpendicular to each other the interference pattern would consist of circular bright and dark fringe know a fringe of equal inclination or haidinger fringe this alignment be very difficult to achieve in practice and more commonly there will be a slight angle between the two return beam due to misalignment of the reflect mirror this result in the formation of straight parallel bright and dark fringe know a fringe of equal thickness or fizeau fringe one of the mirror be attach to a motor-controlled panel and it position along the axis of light propagation be able to be adjust by finite value by adjust the position of this mirror the path difference between the two beam can be change we be especially interested in the point where there be zero path difference between the two beam know a the null point because it will result in a peak -- 2 intensity therefore by shift the position of the mirror over a certain range and take measurement of the interference we be able to narrow the scan range down in order to find the null point the result interferogram will be a plot of the light intensity measure by the detector a a function of the position of the move mirror for monochromatic light we expect a series of sinusoidal bright and dark fringe at the null point a the path difference change through multiple of the wavelength cause different type of interference for a light source with two distinct frequency this sequence of bright and dark fringe becomes modulate base on the separation between their frequency the more frequency that be add to the light source the more modulate the interferogram becomes this can be generalize to the case for a continuous spectrum of light which would be equivalent to the light consist of infinitely many monochromatic source the frequency spectrum for a light source be know a a spectral line which have a gaussian distribution the range of frequency that be contain within the spectral line be know a the spectral width since all the frequency of the spectrum line only interfere constructively at the null point this be where the maximum of intensity will be it can be show that the frequency spectrum 𝑆 𝜈 form a fourier transform pair with the interferogram 𝐼 𝑙 2 this show that by apply a fourier transform to the interferogram we can obtain the spectrum of the light source and this relationship be what form the basis of fourier transform spectroscopy a a result of fourier theory we can also see that for a spectral line that have a gaussian shape the interferogram will also be gaussian in shape furthermore the scale theorem implies that for a wider interferogram we will obtain a narrower spectrum similarly the narrower the distribution the wider the spectrum and at the infinitesimal limit where the interferogram becomes a delta function the spectrum will take on the standard sinusoidal fringe pattern in essence the property of the light source that we be measure through the interferometer be it coherence which describes the ability of the frequency component wave of the light to interfere with each other any two wave that have a constant relative phase to each other be coherent if the wave be not coherent then the fringe amplitude of their interference pattern will slowly decay a the path difference be increase since the beam dephases the coherence of a light source can be quantize through measure it coherence length which be define by convention to be standard deviation 𝜎 of the gaussian it will be easy for u to measure the full-width-at-half-maximum fwhm which be related to the standard deviation by the follow expression for which the coherence length can be easily calculate 3 the type of light source that we will be use in the experiment include lead and tungsten filament light source the colour of light that lead emit be dependent on the energy band gap of the semiconductor that it be make of and be functionally monochromatic therefore we expect the spectral width to be narrow and conversely the coherence length to be relatively wide it should also be note that in industry white lead produce 'white light through a combination of other colour we might expect therefore for a white lead spectrum to produce various wavelength peak tungsten incandescent lamp operate by heating a filament to such a high temperature that it emits light in the visible spectrum a such the tungsten filament can be roughly approximate a a black body and we expect the spectrum to be continuous over a wide range of wavelength stretch into the infra-red region conversely the interferogram should have a small coherence length since we can approximate the filament a a black body and their spectrum depend purely on temperature we can apply wien 's displacement law to calculate the temperature of the filament a follow la_ `` where t be the temperature of the body and 𝜆 bcde be the wavelength in the spectrum with the high intensity a a preliminary investigation a simulation of the interferometer be write and test in order to verify the relation between theory and experiment we generate the spectral line of the light source and then simulated the interference mechanism take place within the beam splitter to produce correspond interferograms first a narrow spectral line for a monochromatic light source be simulated the spectral width be then widen to observe if it have the expect effect on the shape of the interferogram and be eventually broaden so that it roughly represent a white light source we then use the simulation to verify whether a fourier transform of the interferogram could return the original input spectrum one of the key aspect of this investigation involve be able to correctly build and align the michelson interferometer since it precision be largely dependent on how sensitive the interference be to small change in the path difference since the movable mirror m1 be fix to the optical table we align every other device with respect to this fig 3 show the configuration of the light source mirror beam splitter and detector the distance between the two mirror to the beam splitter be make a similar a possible since we need to ensure that over the full movement range of m1 ±10 mm the null point could be reach this be do use a ruler to measure the distance between m1 at it central position to the beam splitter which be found to be 44 × 10 l m and then position the second fix mirror m2 at approximately this distance away from the beam splitter a green laser be use to align the interferometer since it have the brightest and narrow beam in the case that the device be not correctly align two spot be visible which result from the two beam from each arm not be recombine properly the correct alignment could be achieve by use the fine tuner on m2 to adjust it tilt and ensure that the two spot overlap each other at the detector this ensure that the mirror be perpendicular and we would expect haidinger fringe to be form a ground glass diffuser be place between the detector and the beam splitter to expand the point spot and allow the fringe to be more visible once the interferometer have be construct and correctly align we replace the green laser with the other light source that we would analyze -these include a blue lead a white lead and a white tungsten filament light for the two white source the ground glass diffuser be place between the light source and the beam splitter in order to separate out the wavelength so that the interference pattern be clearer a plano-convex lens of focal length 25.4 mm be also place between the beam splitter and the detector for the white tungsten light to focus the output beam onto the detector since it intensity be found to be too low otherwise for each light source the null point be found by scan over the entire range of m1 at a speed of 0.25 mm -1 with a fix scan frequency of 50 hz and observe a visible peak in the interferogram the scan range be then narrow over the null point and the scan speed be slow to 0.0001 mm -1 to produce the desire interferogram 5 that this be tme next we simulated a spectral line of the same peak wavelength but for a spectral width that be double in size we expect the coherence length to be small a the spectral width be increase and therefore the interferogram fwhm should be small fig 6 verifies this since it can be see that the fwhm have approximately halve a we would expect since the spectral width have be double fig 7 also confirms that the fourier transform reproduces the original spectmm since it have the same peak wavelength but a wider distribution the inte1ferogram of the white lead source be show in fig 10 we can obse1ve some asymmetry which can be attribute to misalignment of the apparatus however the effect of this will consider negligible for our experiment the interferogram zoom in around the symmetrical section around the null point be show in from the interferograms and spectrum for the respective light source we be able to calculate the coherence length and peak wavelength these value be show in table i. the coherence length for the blue lead be the large which implies that it be the most coherent light source and this be a we would expect since it should consist of a na1rnwer range of wavelength compare to the white light source and therefore be closest to monochromatic light the coherence length for the other two be on the same order of magnitude since they both produce white light however we would expect the white tungsten light to have a slightly small coherence length due to it continuous spectmm and wide spectral width this discrepancy although small can perhaps be explain by the asymmetry in the interferogram of the white lead fig the value for the peak wavelength be also reasonable since they all lie within the range for the visible spectmm a expect the white lead produce three wavelength peak suggest that it be make up of three component colour the spectmm for the tungsten filament light fig -5 14 be continuous and broad a predict the temperature of the filament be calculate to give 3858 k which be above the quote temperature by the manufacturer of2796 k. the relationship between the inte1ferograms and spectrum through fourier-transform spectroscopy be successfully verify through experiment since our data match the prediction make by both theo1y and simulation it be show that for nattow spectral width the interferograms be wider and more coherent and vice versa in addition the wavelength obtain from the spectrum produce through fourier transfo1ms be ve1y close to the expect wavelength the quote value for the wavelength of the blue lead by the manufacturer be 470 nm 4 1 so our measure value of 464.98 nm be extremely accurate with a percentage e1rnr of 1 for the white lead the three peak have be associate with blue 470 nm yellow 590 nm and orange 605 nm light base on the value from the manufacture14 5 l. our measure value have percentage e1rnrs of3.3 3.1 and 0.2 respectively make them ve1y accurate result finally the white tungsten light produce a peak wavelength of 751.30 nm where it should theoretically be 1000 run 6 1 give a percentage e1rnr of24.9 which be relatively large the temperature calculate from the spectrum be also significantly different from the expect with a percentage e1rnr of 38.0 these discrepancy for the tungsten filament light may have be cause by the use of a focus lens to increase the intensity i,superficial,bal

to each other these be form by monochromatic and coherent beam of light these fringe be extremely useful be determine the null point of the interferometer a will be discus later 2 fizeau fringes-these be fringe of equal thickness and be form due to the thin wedge of air between m1 and m2 when m1 and m2 be not perpendicular to each other 3 to study a source and it spectrum we must convert the interferogram produce by the interferometer to a wavelength spectrum this do use a fast fourier transform fft an fft convert from spatial domain to frequency domain due to the nature of the delta function there be a reciprocal relationship between the separation of the null in the interferogram and the separation of the frequency a gaussian temporal feature lead to a gaussian spectral feature this property be use to analyse the data collect and be discus later 4 iv coherence length 𝐿 the coherence length can be described a `` the distance over which one arm of the michelson interferometer can be scan before the interferogram contrast becomes poor `` 4 the coherence length be give by where 𝑐 be the speed of light and ∆𝜈 be the spectral width hz to turn this into wavelength we can use the formula where ∆𝜆 be the spectral width m and be technically the standard deviation 𝜎 of the gaussian of the wavelength spectrum and 𝜆 be the mean wavelength and can be found use the peak of the gaussian the spectral width m can be found use the full width half maximum 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 by use the formula 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 2.335∆𝜆 4 for a black-body radiator 𝜆= 𝜆 cdef and it be possible to compare the peak wavelength 𝜆 cdef and temperature of a black-body radiator use 𝑇𝜆 cdef 2.898 × 10 lm 5 where t be temperature and be measure in kelvin k this be know a wein 's displacement law the interferometer be set up a show below in figure 3. the interferometer be align use the green laser a the light source a 25.4mm plano-convex lens p/n la1951 -a be place before the beam splitter to broaden the beam and a 100mm plano-convex lens p/n la1509 -a be screw in after the beam splitter before the detector to focus the beam a screen be place approximately 1.5m away so a to reduce uncertainty the screw on the kinematic mirror be adjust till the central circular haidinger fringe could be see on the screen if fizeau fringe be see then the mirror be n't properly align after the interferometer be align the null point d=0 be found this be do a it be around the null point where maximum interference be observe the green laser be first use to find the range in which the nullpoint exists use eq.1 it can be see that 𝜆 be a constant and therefore when d increase 𝜃 must increase therefore a we move towards the null-point the fringe move inwards and a we move away from it the fringe move outwards by use this information and test different point on the move stage the range be narrow down to 0.25mm the green laser be then replace by the white lead and a ground glass diffuser p/n dg10-1500-md be place to remove effect of the conical structure of the lead from the beam the photodetector be place back in it original position the narrow range be then test at a speed of 1𝜇𝑚𝑠 lq the coherence length of white light be approx 10 𝜇𝑚 test at this speed ensure we would see the interference pattern for approx 10 the null point be found a it be the only point where a white light fringe be see on the interferogram the null point be see at approximately -7.39mm position of the stage after the null point be found it be make sure that the interferometer be not disturbed too much and extreme caution be take when change light source three different source be test around their null point and data be take the three source be a white lead p/n ospw5111p a blue lead p/n osub5111p and a stabilize tungsten-halogen light source the tungsten source be use first with no filter then with a green filter p/n fl543.5-10 and then with a yellow filter p/n fb580-10 the data for each reading be take at a speed of 1𝜇𝑚𝑠 lq to get enough data point around the nullpoint the data collect be the signal amplitude time and position of the stage mm this data be then analyse use a python script which output an interferogram and perform an fft on the interferogram to give a wavelength spectrum a gaussian be then fit to the spectrum to get the value of 𝜆/𝜆 cdef 𝜆 be simply the central wavelength of the gaussian and 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 these value be then use to find 𝐿 use eq 2,3 4. note while inputting the data into the programme an offset be notice from the expect value of the wavelength this be because once the stage have stop move repeat measurement be take at the same point this change the value of dsamp average distance between sample to fix this the excess data point be remove a can be see above the wavelength spectrum be a gaussian for the blue lead the mean wavelength be 463.92 ± 14.09 nm the 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 be 32.91 nm ∆𝜆/𝜎 be 14.09 nm and the coherence length be 2.43 ± 0.05 𝜇𝑚 the error for the mean wavelength be simply the standard deviation of the gaussian a the coherence length be a function of the mean wavelength the error for the mean wavelength be then propagate to the coherence length to give u the final error error arose from the uncertainty of the stage of it own position and because the lead could never be place exactly in the center of the light tube the stage can move minimum increment of 0.1 𝜇𝑚 5 the speed be set at 1 𝜇𝑚𝑠 lq and the detector have a frequency of 50 hz this mean that the detector must move 0.02 𝜇𝑚 between each reading but a it can only move 0.1 𝜇𝑚 increment at a minimum there would be repeat measurement at one position lead to an error blue lead be make from indium gallium nitride ingan and the mean wavelength found be well within the range expect by a blue lead make of ingan 450-475 nm 6 it be also expect that the blue lead would have a large coherence length than white light a the blue lead be a monochromatic source this be the case a can be see in the next section ii white lead for the white lead there be two gaussian distribution the first gaussian distribution be similar to that of the blue lead and have a mean wavelength of 451.87 ± 12.38 nm a 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 of 28.72 nm a ∆𝜆/𝜎 of 14.09 nm and a coherence length of 2.62 ± 0.09 𝜇𝑚 whereas the second gaussian distribution be wider and represent the colour from green to red this have a mean wavelength of 577.87 ± 63.11 nm a 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 of 147.35 nm a ∆𝜆/𝜎 of 63.11 nm and a coherence length of 0.84 ± 0.19 𝜇𝑚 it can be see that the coherence length and mean wavelength of the first gaussian be comparable to that of the blue lead the coherence length of the second gaussian be much small a it consists of a wider spectrum of wavelength than the blue lead two distribution be see be because of how a white lead be construct it be very hard to make a white lead a it consists of a wide spectrum of light therefore white light be make from a blue-ingan lead which be coat with yttrium aluminium garnet yag which be a phosphor the phosphor absorbs some of the blue light which it then re-emits a white light due to a phenomenon call stoke 's shift this be a good approximation for white light the blue peak see be therefore a direct contribution of the blue lead whereas the yellow peak see be due to the phosphor coat 7 iii tungsten source no filter for the tungsten source the mean wavelength be 814 ± 122.20 nm the 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 be 285.36 nm ∆𝜆/𝜎 be 122.20 nm and the coherence length be 0.86 ± 0.27 𝜇𝑚 the peak wavelength a state by the manufacturer be 1000 nm 9 and this fall just outside the range of our measurement it be also notice that the tungsten source be closely emulates a black-body radiator use eq.5 it 's temperature be calculate it be see that the tungsten source act like a black-body radiator at 3557.54 ± 537 k. a maxwell-boltzmann distribution be expect a tungsten behaves like a black-body but a can be see the spectrum be like that of white light but with a wider spectrum compare part a b from figure 6 it can be see that the measure data agrees with expect data up until approximately 900 nm and after that there be an unexpected drop this can be attribute to the detector use a it be only senstive to wavelength upto 940 nm 10 this therefore prof that tungsten do behave like a black-body radiator iv tungsten source green and yellow filter it can be see that there be a sudden drop in the amplitude at the central wavelength for both the spectrum this happens because bandpass filter be coat with material of broad block range although these material help block a large range of wavelength they also reduce the transmission of the central wavelength for this reason the central wavelength be n't the peak wavelength and we see a drop in amplitude at the central wavelength 11 the mean wavelength for the green and yellow filter be 539.84 ± 17.32 nm and 578.44 ± 18.08 nm respectively which agrees with the manufacturer value of 543.5 ± 2 nm and 580 ± 2 nm 10 the coherence length for the yellow and green filter be 2.95 ± 0.18 𝜇m and 2.68 ± 0.17 𝜇m respectively in conclusion a michelson interferometer be built and be use to analyse three different source of light a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten source no filter yellow filter and green filter on analyze their wavelength spectrum it be see that the white lead be construct use a blue lead with a phosphor coat this be evident from the two different distribution present it be also see that the tungsten source no filter act like a black-body radiator of 3557.54 ± 537 k. it be determine that the sudden drop in the central wavelength of the tungsten source with the filter be due to the extra coat use to block a large range of wavelength on the filter to improve the experiment a photodetector which be sensitive to large wavelength should be use so that the tungsten source can be properly study this would also help u well determine it temperature a large range of source uv and infra-red should also be look at",superficial,bal
170,2ndINT_NHZ839_Redacted,"interferometry be an experimental method which relies on the interference of a single light source that travel through two different path it have brought groundbreaking result such a the michelson-morley experiment in 1887 refute the aether theory or much more recently the ligo experiment discover gravitational wave i nterferometry be quite a general method which can be set up in various way to study a multitude of parameter such a the length difference between the two path the light ray take or the wavelength spectrum of the source in our experiment we use the

a tungsten lamp with filter or naked the interferometer be then mostly use a a spectrometer get the emission spectrum from the interference pattern a see on figure 1 both beam travel a different path before recombine depend on the path difference they will either interfere constructively or destructively for a single wavelength λ source the interference will be constructive if the path difference be ∆l nλ where n be an integer indeed a beam travel a distance nλ will return to it original phase in the same way the interference will be destructive if the path difference be ∆l n 2 λ. for l and l 2 the respective length from the beam splitter to mirror 1 and mirror 2 then ∆l 2 l −l 2 since each beam travel twice over each length by keep one of these length constant -say l -and then vary l 2 we can look at the evolution of the interference a l 2 move if we draw a graph of the observe intensity over l 2 call an interferogram we can retrieve the wavelength of the source indeed if the mirror move from l 2 a to l 2 b then the path difference between interference a and interference b will be ∆l 2 l 2 a − l 2 b a such the wavelength on the graph will simply be half the wavelength of the source beat ng frequency for 2 s m ar sound wave the sma osc at ons correspond to the mean frequency they happen w th n an enve ope repeat ng w th the beat ng frequency source hep phys c nd ana eu let u now consider a source with two wavelength λ and λ 2 each of equal amplitude the observe wavelength of the source will simply be the mean λ λ λ2 2 for example if we combine a red and a green laser of same intensity at 700 nm and 500 nm wavelength we will observe a yellow beam with a 600 nm wavelength if we shine this combine beam through the interferometer and look at the interferogram we will once again get the oscillation correspond to the mean oscillation but these oscillation will happen within an envelope whose frequency will be f b f − f 2 for f f 2 this be call the beating frequency and can be observe in many place such a combine sound wave this happens because the faster frequency `` lap `` the slow one we can then relate this to a beating wavelength this equation show that the closer the two wavelength be the large the envelope on the interferogram will be c. extend to a large number of wavelength f g 3 beat ng frequency here show for 3 sound wave source http //phys c stackexchange com this beating phenomenon be not restrict to two wavelength but happens for any number of wavelength although it be not a simply described anymore there will still be a periodic envelope around the oscillation correspond to the mean frequency however it will now have many peak and valley see figure 5 by add enough wavelength the envelope will turn into a single short peak surround by long valley once again the size of these envelope will be define by the difference in frequency however a this be for a large number of wavelength we will rather look at the spread in wavelength for a wide spread in wavelength the envelope will be narrower and for a narrow spread in wavelength the envelope will be wider there be no simple formula to express this but we can easily link it to the 2 wave case where a large wavelength difference result in a shorter envelope and vice versa although they be rarely use any more tungsten lightbulb be once the most common light source in any household they consist of a heat up tungsten filament enclose in a noble gas to prevent it from burning by avoid contact with oxygen the filament act a a resistor and be heat up by flow current through it a it be heat up the electron within the tungsten be accelerate these accelerate charge emit wave in the electro-magnetic field light wave this be call `` black-body radiation `` and be described by planck 's law where h c and k b be respectively planck 's constant the speed of light and boltzmann 's constant t be the temperature of the system ν be a frequency and b ν be the intensity of the emission at this frequency figure 4 give u a plot of this but in wavelength space rather than frequency space a show on the plot the spectrum f g 4 p ot of b λ versus λ for t set at

quite wide a we can see that it go way beyond the visible spectrum both above and below e. wavelength spectrum of a white lead the acronym lead stand for light emit diode a state in the name it be a diode the way it emits it light can be described by quantum mechanic but it essentially have to do with current flow through the p-n junction the early visible light lead could only produce yellow or red light but with the invention of blue lead engineer be able to merge those three together to create white lead a such a white lead do not produce a wide a spectrum a it tungsten lamp counterpart but creates white light by combine narrower set of wavelength over the visible spectrum the first step in the laboratory session be to get a feel for how the interferometer work by run simulation we do this with a premade python script ready to use which require to input the spectrum of the light source and would give u the interferogram it would produce to make thing simpler all the source spectrum be gaussian function with a width and a mean wavelength that we could specify we then go on to use a real michelson-morley interferometer a the one schematise figure 1. since we want to draw interferograms one of the mirror be fix while the other could move back and forth with a computer-controlled motor the recombine beam then go in a detector connect to the same computer we could thus easily obtain data for the distance move by the mirror and the interference this produce f g 6 the way we define a coherence ength n order to compare our enve opes w dths a explain in the previous subsection a computer be already setup to record the mirror 's position and the correspond interference in a .txt file it be very easy to extract this data and plot it out use python we be provide with a python script which be meant to fit a function over the interferogram this would allow u to apply a fourier transformation to the function and retrieve the wavelength of the signal turn our interferometer into an effective spectrometer however this script do not work so we could only get more basic data from our interferogram the distance between two oscillation correspond to half the mean wavelength of the source a explain in the theory section we could also compare the width of the envelope by look at a `` coherence length `` we chose this to be the distance over which the oscillation amplitude be above 10 of the maximum amplitude see figure 6 our first two simulation be run for a single gaussian spectrum with the mean wavelength at 589 nm and in the first case σ 0.01nm and in the second σ 2 0.05nm look at the interferograms on a nanometer scale there be no difference between these signal they be both simply sinusoidal and of same frequency however if we zoom out at the meter scale we could see the envelope around those oscillation figure 7 and 8 show a sketch of this in my lab book a we can see the second simulation result in a shorter higher-frequency envelope it wavelength be half the wavelength of the first envelope this be coherent with the explanation for the envelope provide in the theory section a the second simulation have a much wider range of wavelength in the light source although it be hard to see on these sketch the peak of the second simulation envelope be indeed quite narrower than on the first we then ran far simulation where we widen the gaussians even far or add more wavelength the result be all consistent with the theory section have wider gaussians would produce narrower envelope and add more wavelength would produce some more complex-shaped envelope see figure 5 on the real interferometer we use various different light source the first one be a green laser which simply produce a sine wave on the interferogram technically even a laser have some wavelength range and be not infinitesimally precise so we should have see an envelope around this signal however the motor control mirror could only move by a few millimeter and that be not enough to see the very large envelope for the rest of our light source however the range of wavelength be much big so we could see the envelope around the oscillation we could in fact only see one envelope peak around the point be both mirror be at the same distance figure 9,10,11,12,13 show the interferograms we obtain respectively for a white lead a blue lead a tungsten lamp and then the same tungsten lamp first with a yellow then with a green filter there be two thing to note before look at the number these plot give u first for the white lead the envelope be asymmetrical a there appear to be a little blob on the right of it this be probably because our lead be not perfectly align when shin through the interferometer and the white lead do not shine in the same way in all direction a explain before the white lead combine the narrow blue lead spectrum and the wider red and yellow spectrum the main envelope be probably from when all the wavelength be combine or only the red-yellow part the blob after it be probably from the blue part of the spectrum which would be wider on the interferogram the second thing to note be that the interferograms from the filter do not present a single envelope peak but some other small peak next to it this be probably due to the nature of the filter which might let through some doublet of wavelength quite close to each other and create this kind of beating frequency a explain in the experimental method section we measure the mean wavelength by look at the separation in distance between two oscillation and characterise the width of the envelope with the coherence length the precision of these method be limited by the accuracy at which we could measure with the computer cursor so we chose an error of ±10nm for each wavelength measurement and an error of ±100nm for the coherence length since both the tungsten lamp and the white lead produce white light it seem relevant to compare them of course the coherence length of the lead be quite large than the tungsten lamp since it spectrum be narrower an other interest fact be that even though they both emit white light the mean wavelength of the tungsten lamp be much big and quite in the red part of the visible light spectrum if we look at figure 4 show the emission spectrum of a black-body radiation we can see that it decrease quite slowly in the large wavelength meaning that the tungsten lamp emits a large quantity of infrared light cause the mean wavelength to red-shift for the blue and the white lead we can see that the coherence length be big for the blue lead this be unsurprising consider that the blue lead spectrum be part of the white lead spectrum and thereby small for the filter light both green and yellow the coherence length be much large than the rest since instead of a continuous spectrum the filter brutally cut off all part of the spectrum that be not within the filter 's wavelength these result show that we can learn a lot of thing on a light source from the interference pattern it creates even with quite basic data gather we be able to confirm a lot of thing about the know spectrum be able to recreate the full spectrum from a fourier transform of the interferogram would really show what a powerful technique this be",extended,none
171,2ndINT_BYH124_Redacted,measure the spectral component of some light source by use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer abstract-the aim of this experiment be to construct a michelson interferometer to produce and record interferograms from some light source which be compose of different spectral component the data from th interferograms be use to study the spectrum of these source however before any real-world data be take use the apparatus the interferograms for the different source be simulated in a computer use python program language a reference for real interferograms the null point in our set up be found by first use a green laser and then by use a white lead the interferograms from a blue lead a tungsten lamp and a mercury discharge lamp be produce and analyse after find the null point for both the tungsten lamp and the mercury discharge lamp a yellow and a green filter be separately use during investigation the interferograms of some light source from the experiment be process by use fast-fourier-transform fft the null point be locate to be approximately between -4.2 mm and -4.3 mm from the other investigation it be found that the narrower the spectrum of the source be the broader be the interferograms and that different light source emit different range of frequency of the same colour spectrum i nterferometry can be define a a family of technique use to extract information about electromagnetic wave by superimpose the latter to produce interference pattern 1 the technique of interferometry be tremendously use in various field such a in astronomy engineering chemistry and in numerous physic discipline an example of an application of interferometry in the optic industry be to test optical component by verify if they be properly make 2 there exists a variety of interferometer for instance the michelson interferometer the fabry-pérot interferometer the fizeau interferometer and the mach-zehnder interferometer just to name some each one of them have different advantage and disadvantage over the others and depend on what one want to investigate different interferometer be use to get interferograms and fringe a say earlier we make use of the principle of interference normally when someone want to study the spectral component of an electromagnetic source spectrometer and grate be use to produce fringe however by use the michelson interferometer a a spectrometer we get a very precise ruler thus reduce the uncertainty in the information that be obtain from the interferograms when michelson interferometer be use in such a way it call a fourier transform spectrometer ft since one of the mirror be make to move in this kind of interferometry fringe be form when an electromagnetic wave ew be make to recombine with itself refer to figure 3 whereas in conventional spectrometry fringe be form only after the ew have pas through a grate where the ew later superimpose during the experiment most of the apparatus use be kept at a fix position when data be be record except for one of the mirror which be fit to a motor to scan a whole spectrum the position and speed of the movable be adjust by use a computer to which the motor be connect the reliability of the data depends on how good the alignment be make the type of fringe that be use to capture data from the different source of light be circular fringe refer to the 'theory section for more information ii theory not all light source emit light in the same way in this experiment four different type of source be use and the physic behind which they emit light be different the first type use be a light-emitting diode lead which do not contain any filament unlike incandescent bulb lead emit light when electron move between quantise energy level in a semiconductor material 3 regard a tungsten lamp the latter which contains a filament make of tungsten metal emits light like a black body source just like the sun the bulb contain the filament also contains an inert gas and a small amount of halogen when a piece of metal be heat above a certain temperature it will start to glow and depend on the temperature of the filament it will emit different colour but the filament will reach a maximum temperature 4 lastly a mercury vapour lamp also know a a discharge lamp contains a small arc which heat a tube contain solid mercury when the tube becomes hot enough the solid mercury vapourizes to create uv light and the hotter it get the more it light intensity increase 5 figure 1 show the two type of fringe that could be obtain in this experiment the fringe appear circular when the two mirror on which the light be reflect be properly align and this type of fringe be know a haidinger fringe however when the mirror be align in a wedge-like position a show on the upper right of figure 1 b the fringe will appear to be parallel to each other and these fringe be know a fizeau fringe the mathematics behind why for different alignment different fringe be obtain can be found from 6 parallel fringe form when one of the mirror be slightly inclined reproduce from 6 7 when an electromagnetic spectrum consist of two distinct frequency be sent into an interferometer the sequence of bright and dark fringe will still be obtain like when use a monochromatic light but the sequence will be modulate instead and will look like wave beat a show in figure 2. the null point be where the two frequency be in phase with each other and where their intensity be a maximum the result interferogram will have multiple null point and the small the difference between the two frequency the far apart be the consecutive null point from each other figure 2 picture show at the top an electromagnetic spectrum with two different frequency form beat and at the bottom the null point at m 0 and the phase between the two wavelength reproduce from 7 the data extract from a gaussian interferogram can be fourier-transform ft in order to get the gaussian spectral line of the electromagnetic spectrum in fact an inverse relationship exists between the width of these two gaussians before it be possible to find the spectral width ∆v of the source the coherence length l need first to be found the latter can be obtain from the sigma σ of the gaussian interferogram an equation relate the full width half maximum f w hm to the sigma of the gaussian interferogram be give a the value of the sigma refers to that of the coherence length the spectral width ∆v of the source can then be calculate use the relationship where c be the speed of the electromagnetic spectrum 7 before the michelson interferometer be set up some simulation be perform on a computer use the python program language it be important to simulate interferograms and their ft so a we can get an idea whether the interferograms that be obtain from the interferometer agree with what we expect to find simulation be also perform while real-world data be be take to get the best possible data from the set up show in figure 3 all experiment be carry out near the null point m 0 refer to figure 2 the reason be because at that null point the beam come out from the beam splitter have the maximum intensity compare at other point where the distinct frequency be in phase with each other therefore this greatly reduces the influence of fluctuate background light in our data a white cardboard be firstly place at the position of the detector if the two mirror be properly align one should have observe circular fringe on the cardboard to find roughly the null point the mount and movable mirror m 2 be make to move over a certain range and the fringe be observe to move the position of the null point would be where the direction in which the circular fringe be initially move would change direction for instance the position at which the fringe move away from the centre to move towards the centre would be where the null point be after have found roughly the position of the null point the detector contain the photodiode osram sfh2200 be then use with a green collimate laser p/n cps532 and a white lead p/n ospw5111p to find more accurately the null point when the green laser be use a large range of the scan stage be take since the interferogram produce be very broad the white lead be then use to locate even more precisely the position of the null point since it produce a narrower interferogram the mirror m 2 have a limited range over which it could move and so to make sure the null point be within this range when set the apparatus the distance of the two mirror from the centre of the beam splitter should be a similar a possible so a the wavelength be in phase with each other m 0 after the null point be locate the follow experiment and procedure be carry out use the apparatus and a computer 1 the interferograms of a white lead a blue lead and a white light tungsten source with yellow and green filter use separately be produce and be fourier-transform 2 the data obtain be plot use python and gaussian fit be add to the plot 3 the coherence length and spectral width of some of the source be calculate 4 yellow and green filter be separately use to produce fringe from a mercury discharge lamp the range scan and at which the speed the mirror m 2 move for each light source during data record be found below look at the interferograms from both the green laser and white light figure 4 the null point be found to be between -4.225 mm and -4.230 mm the envelope of the green laser interferograms be not smooth because there be a possibility that the laser be not a perfect monochromatic light source single line the interferogram from the green laser be very broad compare to that of the white light lead due to the fact that the spectrum of the green laser be very narrow while the white light lead emit a variety of frequency have a very broad spectrum from figure 5 b the uncertainty horizontal direction in the process data come in by consider that the mirror m 2 may not move exactly by 0.002 mm/s the high the speed at which the motor be move the great be the uncertainty for each data point the interferogram and the plot obtain from the fft of the blue light lead be show in figure 6. if the graph from figure 5 a be compare to that of figure 6 a it can be see that the interferogram from the blue light lead be broader than that of the white light lead this agrees with what be say earlier in the 'theory section that the spectrum of the blue lead be narrower than that of the white lead it be well-known that white light have an array of distinct frequencies/wavelengths thus result in the broader spectrum and in the two peak at different wavelength a show in figure 5 b although a broader gaussian with only one peak be expect figure 7 show the interferograms and plot of fft obtain from the tungsten lamp use the yellow filter first then the green filter the presence of small beat on both side of the interferogram part with the high amplitude in figure 7 a and in 7 c be may be due to the filter not filter perfectly the white light for the detector to detect only yellow or green light consider only the plot from the yellow light for the tungsten lamp the latter can not be a doublet cause these beat or we would have get the same fringe pattern over the scan range a we will see later with the mercury lamp although figure 7 b seem to show two different peak close to each other but unlike what we say in the theory section here the x-axis be a measure of wavelength instead of frequency therefore in the frequency space the two peak would have be far from each other and it be know that the big the difference between the frequency the closer be the null point fringe with high amplitude once again it can be see that the broader the gaussian spectrum the narrower be the interferogram the sigma σ for the gaussian spectrum of each light source be found use the python program language the fwhm and the spectral width of each of the light source be then calculate use equation 1and equation 2 respectively the value for the sigma of the gaussian the fwhm and the spectral width for the white lead blue lead and tungsten lamp with both filter can be found in the table ii the uncertainty in these value be not include because the value of these uncertainty give by python seem to be not sensible at all this be may be because of the background noise which affected the gaussian fit from figure 8 a it can be deduce that the gaussian green-colour spectrum of the mercury discharge lamp must be very narrow owe to the very broad interferogram on the other hand the interferogram in figure 8 b show multiple beat and this already indicates u that the yellow spectrum of the uv light emit by the mercury lamp be not a singlet it be in fact a doublet and hence it be why these beat appear in the interferogram more information about the different frequency that a mercury discharge lamp emits can be found at 8 the most interest find be that both the yellow light and the green light emit by the tungsten lamp and mercury lamp respectively be not similar in term of the shape of the interferograms one source have a great range of frequency of the same colour than the other the objective of this experiment be to set up a michelson interferometer and use it a a spectrometer to investigate the spectrum of some light source by record the interferograms from the device some simulation of the interferograms and fft of the different light source be perform prior to find the null point and some be also do during definitive circular fringe movement start to change direction and then by use a green collimate beam and a white lead after determine the position of the null point the interferograms of a white lead and a blue lead be record a tungsten lamp and a mercury discharge lamp both yellow and green filter add separately be also investigate the data from the lead and tungsten lamp be then process use a fft their fourier-transform enable u to analyse the spectrum of these light source and to determine their value of σ f w hm and ∆v in this set up the null point be approximately found to be around -4.227 mm the first observation obtain confirm that a light source which produce a broad interferogram have a narrow spectrum and that the reverse be also true regard the spectrum of the white lead it be expect to be just a broad spectrum with only one peak but a spectrum with two be instead obtain in this experiment this mean that not all different frequency from the spectrum of the lead be close to each other to only make a broad spectrum a far result found be that different light source do not emit the same colour spectrum for instance the filter yellow light from the tungsten source be a singlet whereas the yellow light emit from the mercury discharge lamp be a doublet but both yellow light have the same wavelength a it should be one of the major difficulty during the experiment be to find the null point which be time consume another difficulty be to isolate the detector from background light noise and occasional from shock when data be be take the vibration and noise make it difficult to get a reliable plot from the fft of the interferogram the experiment can be improve by fitting shock absorber to the bench on which the michelson interferomter be set up some kind of light screen can also be add to the set up for instance on the side of the detector to minimise noise even more from get into the data moreover other filter could be use on the tungsten and mercury discharge lamp to investigate more difference between the two spectrum lastly the vertical uncertainty for the data point of each plot could be determine by record the value of the background noise before each data be take • spectral width of a source if a source emits monochromatic electromagnetic wave the source spectral width be the width of the narrow line on a conventional spectrometer however if a source be non-monochromatic the spectral width be define a the range of frequency the source emits • spectral width of a filter the range of frequency a filter allows to pa be know a it spectral width or `` bandwidth `` • coherence length the contrast of an interferogram becomes poor if the distance over which the fringe be scan be more than one arm of a michelson interferometer that be great than the distance between one arm of the michelson interferometer this be know a the coherence length and the spectral quality of a source depends on it the above definition be obtain at 7 i want to thank my lab partner for the good work we do together during this experiment all the supervisor for their support and guideline and also the lab technician for their prompt help for solve some technical issue,extended,none
172,2ndINT_VJL711_Redacted,"all the light emit source have their own unique wavelength and some of them consist of more than one wavelength by use the same set-up a the michelson-morley experiment we investigate the radiation property of blue and white lead and tungsten and mercury lamp it be found that the blue lead tungsten and mercury lamp emit a mean wavelength of 438 ± 22.6 nm 410 ± 92 nm and 564 ± 134 nm respectively on the other hand the white lead emits light with two wavelength 475 ± 11 nm and 542 ± 49 nm also for the tungsten and me1•cm-y lamp their mean temperature be calculate by wien 's displacement law w hen two or more coherent wave su~erpose they fo1m a great or low wave and this 1 knov.rn a wave interference the amplitude of the resultant wave depends on their phase difference and therefore their frequency which mean it be possible to analyse the component wave by investigate the resultant wave this technique be widely use in many different branch of science and be particularly well-known a be use in the michelson-morley experiment in 1887 albeit michelson and edward morley use white light and a half-silvered mitrnr which split the light into two pe1pendicular beam a show in fig 1 and try to see the path difference from these two beam so that they could prove the existence of `` the aether `` which be assume to be a medium of light even though they repeat the experiment with increase sensitivity the result be always negative this experiment have be know a the most famous fail experiment and michelson won the nobel prize in physic 1907. the two split beam be completely in phase then it would produce a constmctive interference pattem however if the sjpeed of the beam change after be reflect at the splitter then they be not in phase cause the interference pattem to differ from the original and a destmctive interference pattem would occur depend on the degree of the change in speed the change in speed of the beam mean the time take for the light to re-enter the half-silvered mi1rnr would chan e likewise the same result can also be obtain if fhe separation of the two min-or change which result in a change in time take for the light to go back to the halfsilvered min-or and therefore the phase difference in the experiment we change the position of the rniitor to investigate an interference pattem of several light source michelson-morley interferometer layout a monochromatic point source in the michelson-morley experiment cause localise interference fringe if the mirtors be perfectly perpendicular then the fringe be an equal inclirration or haidirrger frirrges these frirrges have a shape of a circle a the perfectly perpendicular or perfectly parallel lens produce two virtual image result irr a formation of concentric spherical fringespl a the angle of the irrclirration change the spherical fringe become laterally move and a a result they tum into a hyperbolic and linear shape the haidinger fringe do not appear when a chromatic source be use so we initially use a green light source to find the null point in the experiment we use a photodetector to analyse the change in the intensity of the superpose wave the photodetector we use have a sample rate of 50 hz which mean the detector only can measure 50 sample per second the nyquist theorem can be simply state a `` the sample frequency should be twice great than the high frequency contain in the signal `` 3 1_ this mean that for one full oscillation of a sinusoidal wave sample the detector should be able to measure at least two point of the wave therefore accord to the nyquist theorem for a wave of a wavelength of500 nm one oscillation of wave should at least take 2/50 second so that the detector can measure at least two point of this wave therefore in the experiment the motor should move at most 12.5 ~uns- 1 when two or more wavelength with different frequency interfere there exists a constructive interference and destructive interference a show in fig 2 this give a new shape which can be perceive a a periodic wave and the distance from a crest to an adjacent crest be call a coherence length of this new wave the coherence length can be use to evaluate the spectral width of this periodic wave a t .v x l 1 2n where t .v be the spectral width in hertz li the coherence length in metre and c be the speed oflight 3 x 10 8 ms-1 to conve1t the spectral width into the range of wavelength c .v -x .a 2 f where .a be the range of the wavelength and a be the peak frequency in the range by combine 1 and 2 we can relate the spectral width and the range of the wavelength a 1 j2 .a -x 3 2n l the wien 's displacement law state that for black body object they emit blackbody radiation with a peak wavelength give by b amax t 4 where b be call wien 's displacement constant equal to 2 .898 x 10-3 mk and t be the absolute temperature of the blackbody in kelvin we set up the michelson-morley interferometer a show in fig 1 yet the screen be replace to a photodetector and one of the miitors be built on a motor so that we could finely change it position and va1y the light intensity detect at the detector the detector be connect to a computer which we could analyse the change in the light intensity where the change be cause by constructive and destructive interference of the split beam the maximum constructive interference occurs when the two min-ors be at the same level and at the same distance away from the beam splitter a discus in theo y pa1t when the light be monochromatic and coherent and the separation be equal there should be haidinger fringe on ha-jun yoon 2 .918 3,920 3.9n s. n4 j.92 j.na j.930 393i the position of the null point the maximum peak be at 3.925 mm away from the centre of the motor the screen at this null point therefore we use a green laser with a piano-convex lens and sa w the haidinger fringe to ensure that the beam be perfectly align then we replace the laser and lens to white lead in order to find a preliminary null point we then use the computer to move the motor sensitively to find the null point the motor moved± 0.05 mm around the preliminary null point with a speed of 2 µm per second where the speed be chosen after a number of simulation cod work which ensure that the value be sufficiently time efficient and follow the nyquist theorem by analyse the variation of the light intensity and find the peak in this region we found the null point which be show in fig 3. then we replace the light source to a blue lead a tungsten source and a mercury discharge lamp and investigate the variation of the light intensity around the null point we be give a code which perfonns fast fourier transfonns on the inte1ferogram which i do not understand by hea1t this turn the interferogram back to a wavelength sjpectmm which lead u to analyse the component wavelength of each source a white lead blue lead white light tungsten and mercury lamp be use and we observe that they overall have some similar pattems a show in fig 2 we expect and saw the increment of the intensity of the incident compound light a the motor and the second rnittor approach towards the null point also they be all emit light with one or two wavelength band yet with different width first of all for the blue lead the interferogram and the fft of the interferogram a.re show in fig 4. the interferogram graph show that the blue lead the coherence length be about 1.25 x 10-5 m which allows u to find the spectral width of the blue lead source by use 1 the spectral width be found to be 7 .25 x 10 10 hz and therefore the range of the wavelength be 45.2 run the fft graph show that most of the light be emit with a wavelength of 438 ± 22.6nm on the other hand for the white lead we observe that it contains more than one peak but two a show in fig 5 the interferogram show that the coherence length for the white lead be about 5.02 x 10-5 m. although the interferogram seem to be the same a the blue lead with a great coherence length the fft frankly tell that the white lead 1 2 and 3 we found that the wavelength of the tv.•o peak be 475 ± 11 run and 542 ± 49 nm this result can be explain with the structure of lead most of the white lead consist of a driver lead and a blue lead with a layer which encloses it a a wave emit from the blue lead travel through the layer it interferes with the layer and turn into white-ish light due to an imperfection of the manufacturing process and age of lead some of the wave emit from the white lead have a blue-wave wavelength thirdly the tungsten lamp show in fig 6 seem to have a genuinely similar pattem with the white lead but a broader width the coherence length and the spectral width a.re found to be 3x l0-4m and 7.52 x 10 10 hz respectively this give the wavelength of the light emit from the tungsten source be in the range of 410 ± 92 nm lastly for the mercury lamp it be found that the wavelength be in the range of 564 ± 134 nm for the tungsten and mercwy lamp their ffts show that the tail be more spread than of the lead this be because the tungsten and mercury lamp radiate light in the form of the thermal radiation which in theory should contain almost all wavelength a show in fig 8. we found out that the movement of the motor be not consistent but the distance between sample varies we measure the distance it move per sample and make a histogram a show in fig 9 with a gaussian fit even though the sample size be not big enough the histogram and the gaussian fit show that the mean distance between sample be 0.24 µm with a standard deviation of 3.338 which arises an uncertainty of 13.7 we can approximate the tungsten source and the mercury lamp a blackbody whereas not the lead since lead be pn junction which emit light depend on the band gap of the lead which depends on the material that they be make of whereas blackbody radiate light only depend on their temperature by use the wein 's displacement law give in 4 we can approximate the temperature of the tungsten and mercury lamp a 7068 ± 968 k and 5138 ± 704 k respectively however the melt point of the tungsten be 3695 k so i highly doubt our tungsten measurement the accepted temperature range of mercury be between 5600 k and 6400 k and therefore we agree that our measurement for mercury be reliably do the major error source throughout the experiment be the inconsistency in the motor movement since this be a systematic error we could not remove this fundamental error of the experiment to make it reliable also a discus in result a wavelength of each source the blackbody object should emit wave with a continuous hill-shape of wavelength but our experiment give a bell-like shape graph just like lead we could not figure out why this happen throughout the experiment we investigate the light-emitting property of white blue lead tungsten and mercury lamp by use the michelson-morley experiment set-up and found the wavelength spectrum of the source and calculate their peak wavelength however we arrive at a disappoint result in find the colour temperature of the tungsten apart from this all the other value seem to be in an acceptable range so the tungsten measurement should be repeat",superficial,the
173,2ndINT_SKD544_Redacted,michelson interferometer with motorise mirror be use to produce interferograms of a tungsten white light source both with and without filter the interferograms be fourier transform to recreate the input spectrum render the whole process an alternative method of optical spectroscopy the tungsten source be intend to resemble a blackbody spectrum and the data collect exhibit sign of this relationship though the evaluation be limited by poor detector sensitivity the filter act to permit only a small range of wavelength to be transmit around a specify central wavelength the experimental data produce value of 580 nm and 543.5 nm for the yellow and green filter respectively the standard error on these wavelength be 15 nm which be significantly wider than the simulated 5 nm this be thought to be due to variation in the detector sample step however the determine central wavelength match specification value which support this method of spectroscopy use an interferometer t he spectrometer be an instrument central to numerous field of science use to disperse light into a spectrum of it constituent wavelength the spectrometer provide a mechanism for determine property of light source this have far-reaching impact for a material heat to the point of incandescence it spectrum be characteristic of it elemental composition spectroscopy have historically aid the discovery of new element such a caesium and rubidium 1 and the development of new technology such a neon light 2 the development of spectroscopy be far influential in physic the emission spectrum of white light be unusual in that the total energy be not equally distribute among all frequency spur the development of quantum mechanic in this experiment a michelson interferometer be use a a spectrometer this possibility arises from the mathematics of fourier transforms where position space be convert to frequency or wavelength space transform the interferogram a plot of amplitude against position therefore provide a method of recreate the original spectrum of light go into the interferometer a tungsten white light source have a spectrum that be often model a that of a blackbody so study it interferogram and fourier transform to wavelength space can evaluate the extent to which this be correct since the star and planet be often model a blackbody where the elemental composition of the body influence the emission spectrum the action of filter on the tungsten spectrum have significance and can be explore the success of the result can therefore be interpret a a test for the efficacy of this method of spectroscopy a michelson interferometer consists of a light source beamsplitter two mirror and a detector a show in fig 1 the beamsplitter which be make up of two adjacent prism allows the light beam from the source to be split into two beam of approximately equal intensity one beam a travel to the mirror m 1 and the other b travel to the mirror m 2 upon which they be both reflect the two beam return to the beamsplitter and undergo a partial reflection and recombination interfere a they recombine the recombine beam can be image on white card the difference in distance between each mirror and the beamsplitter be represent by t. for a plane monochromatic wave with wavelength λ if t be equal to zero which be know a the 'null point or t be an integer multiple of λ then the two beam will constructively interfere if t be equal to an odd integer multiple of λ 2 then destructively interference will occur this produce an interference pattern a series of dark and light fringe if mirror m 2 be exactly perpendicular to beam b cylindrical symmetry allows haidinger fringe to form 3 which appear a concentric cylindrical circle a show in fig 2. mirror m 1 can be motorise in order to slowly alter the distance t. the detector can then scan over a range of t value and measure the intensity at that point to produce an interferogram for a monochromatic source this interferogram will appear a a sine wave however if the light source be not monochromatic but contains two distinct frequency the resultant interferogram will be modulate wave of both frequency leave the source with the same phase but will only have the same phase upon reach the detector if t be equal to zero or an integer multiple of both wavelength if use a source with many wavelength such a a white light emit diode the modulation will increase in number until the interferogram have a gaussian appearance all of these interferograms in position-space be related to the spectrum of the light source in frequency space by a fourier transform by fourier transform the output interferogram of any source it be possible to reclaim the original spectrum the michelson interferometer can thus be use a a spectrometer when the distance between the two mirror and the beamsplitter be unequal the two light beam recombine at the beamsplitter with a path difference the coherence length of the light source be define a follow for a difference in path length between the two beam great than the coherence length phase relation between two different ray become random 5 a a result for distance from the null point great than the coherence length no interference be detect the peak on the resultant interferogram therefore have a width approximately equal to the coherence length if the light contains a very limited range of frequency such a that from a green laser the coherence length be very large which produce a wide interferogram for a light source contain many different wavelength such a a white lightemitting diode the resultant interferogram have a narrow peak a tungsten white light source have an output that approximates to a blackbody radiation spectrum the tungsten source use in this experiment provide a constant-intensity spectrum from 360 to 2600 nanometre reference thorlabs it spectrum be claimed to most closely resemble a blackbody at 2796k 6 the temperature t be inversely proportional to the peak wavelength λ peak 7 and be give by where b be stefan 's constant which be equal to 2.898 × 10 − 3 km to 3.s.f a filter act to restrict the wavelength allow through it two filter be available a green filter with a central wavelength of 543.5 nanometre and a yellow filter with a central wavelength of 580 nanometre both have a full width at half maximum of 10 nanometre and have a characteristic gaussian transmission spectrum 8 since few wavelength be present the coherence length increase so the interference pattern appear over a wider range of mirror position the predict spectrum of a tungsten source with filter be assume to be give by the convolution of the tungsten spectrum and the filter transmission spectrum 9 since the transmission range of each filter be so narrow approximately ten nanometre compare to the overall range of the tungsten lamp there be little noticeable difference between the convolute output and original gaussian input however the simulation be able to be later compare to the data collect simulation for the tungsten source both with and without filter be show in fig 3. the michelson interferometer be assemble accord to fig 4. care be take to ensure that all component be the same height by use of a magnetic beam ruler the distance between each mirror and the beamsplitter be make approximately equal component be secure by screw them into a vibration-damping board which reduces fluctuation in the interference pattern due to external vibration clamp fork be use to far secure component correct alignment of the interferometer be essential for produce clear interference pattern a green laser of wavelength 532 nanometre be use for alignment 10 the collimation package be screw into the lens tube which itself be screw into the beamsplitter so that the light beam be exactly perpendicular to the beamsplitter prism surface first the angle of the beamsplitter be adjust so that the laser beam reflect off the centre of the move mirror the angle of the fix mirror be also adjust so that the laser beam also reflect off of it centre the detector be replace with a sheet of white card on which to image the laser beam for alignment the angle of the fix mirror be adjust in small increment until the two beam overlap on the card this card be initially held close to the beamsplitter then held at a great distance to finetune the beam overlap so that they be coincident insert a planoconvex lens expand the laser beam to a broaden source so that interference fringe be visible the angle of the fix mirror be once again finetuned so that the centre of the haidinger fringe laid at the centre of the field of view the white card be then replace with the detector which be position so that the centre of the haidinger fringe laid on the detector itself the detector be once again secure with a clamp fork and the laser replace with the tungsten white light source due to the nature of the white light tungsten source which have a wide spectrum contain numerous wavelength it be only around the null point at which there be visible interference a discus in coherence length although it be possible to scan over the whole range of the motorise mirror the slow rate at which the mirror must move to detect the interference peak make this extremely unpractical require ten of thousand of reading therefore it be useful to first find the approximate region within the mirror 's range of the null point in order to find this region the green laser be use due to it clear interference fringe at all mirror position the white card be place in front of the detector to more clearly image the fringe a the mirror move towards the null point the haidinger fringe will move towards the central bright fringe conversely fringe will move out of the centre a the mirror travel away from the null point therefore the approximate location of the null point can be determine by the direction of fringe travel in this way the null point be determine to be between −5.0 and −5.5 millimetre due to fluctuation in the position of the central fringe a the mirror approach the null point it be difficult to limit the null point to a small range however this range be deem sufficiently small over which to scan slowly with the tungsten light source in place the range of −5.0 to −5.1 millimetre be scan through at a speed of 0.01 millimetre per second and more precise location of the null point determine to then more precisely view the interference pattern the detector be scan through the new small range of −5.01 to −5.03 millimetre at a slow speed of 0.002 millimetre per second each of the two filter be place into the tungsten light source box before the light beam reach the collimation package the detector be scan initially over the same two millimetre range a previously use but this range be make large if necessary so that the whole interference pattern be in view the tungsten source with no filter produce an interferogram with gaussian shape the relevant interferograms be show in fig 5-7. unexpected modulation be present for both the yellow and green filter since the filter both have a gaussian shape wavelength transmission distribution a gaussian interferogram be expect possible reason for this discrepancy be explore in far discussion the coherence length for the tungsten source with no filter be much small than that of the tungsten source with either a green or yellow filter a see on the x-axis scale this be due to the large range of wavelength present a previously explain in coherence length a discus in theory the fourier transform of each interferogram for the tungsten source both with and without filter can recreate the spectrum of light go into the interferometer for the tungsten source with no filter fig 8. show both the simulated and experimental spectrum which be vertically scale for easy comparison the experimental spectrum appear to have a peak wavelength of approximately 780 nanometre which corresponds to a blackbody temperature of 3700k accord to 1 however the detector use have a lack of sensitivity in the infrared region correspond to wavelength between 700 nanometre and 1 millimetre it can be see by comparison with the simulation that the experimental curve would extend and peak at a high wavelength therefore the actual peak wavelength can not be determine without extreme and unsupported extrapolation the experimental spectrum for the green and yellow filter be show in fig 9. the simulated spectrum for the yellow and green filter be two narrow approximate gaussians centre on 543.5 and 580 nanometre with a standard error of 5 nanometre the experimental data do indeed lie centre on the expect wavelength but it be clear from fig 9 that there be a much great wavelength spread in the transform spectrum a discus in the effect of filter the convolution of the blackbody spectrum from the tungsten source and the narrow gaussian transmission spectrum of the filter give another approximate gaussian the experimental result show peak and trough in the exact same position for both filter which suggests that their shape be due to systematic error or irregularity of the filter therefore to determine an estimate spread on the wavelength from the filter spectrum they be fit to gaussians with a mean of the central filter wavelength the optimise fit be show in fig 10 the standard error on these gaussians be 15 nanometre this increase in spread of wavelength compare with the simulated 5 nanometre be likely due to the data collection method by examine the raw data it be found that the motorise mirror do not necessarily move in equal distance step although the whole range be cover data step varied by up to 3 × 10 − 5 millimetre from the set value give that the average data step for precise scan be approximately 4 × 10 − 5 millimetre assume a constant data step for the fourier transform result in a wider spread of wavelength than the true spread it be possible that fitting a gaussian to these spectrum be not appropriate the modulation present in fig 6 and fig 7 suggest that the filter have irregularity and do not have a gaussian transmission spectrum the interferograms have the appearance of a 'sinc function which be give by fig 9. amplitude against wavelength for experimental tungsten light source with green and yellow filter fig 10. amplitude against wavelength for experimental tungsten light source with green and yellow filter both experimental result and gaussian fit the fourier transform of this function be a step function which have an approximately constant intensity at all wavelength in a range drop off steeply at either end the spectrum from the two filter do not match either the step function or gaussian particularly well but suggest that perhaps the filter transmission spectrum do not match their specification the interferograms of a tungsten light source be successfully experimentally test for both no filter and a green or yellow filter with a michelson interferometer the interferograms be fourier transform to attempt to recreate the spectrum of the light source the interferometer be therefore use a a spectrometer and these spectrum be then compare to the previously simulated spectrum which be base on data value for the light source and filter the main source of error with any optical experiment of this sort be misalignment small degree of misalignment can introduce large discrepancy and asymmetry of the interferogram dust and residue collect on the mirror over time a well a accidental smudge on assembly these irregularity would equally introduce anomaly into the interferograms and therefore the resultant spectrum practical improvement to the experiment would generally involve take more measurement over the null point this be especially the case for the tungsten source with no filter a the coherence length be very small due to the large range of wavelength present since the same mirror speed be use for all data collect few data point be collect over the null point for the tungsten source with no filter produce a disjoint spectrum despite the lack of valid data for the infrared region a smoother curve for the visible region could allow the tungsten spectrum to be fit to a blackbody spectrum and therefore well

174,2ndINT_SKD544_Redacted,michelson interferometer with motorise mirror be use to produce interferograms of a tungsten white light source both with and without filter the interferograms be fourier transform to recreate the input spectrum render the whole process an alternative method of optical spectroscopy the tungsten source be intend to resemble a blackbody spectrum and the data collect exhibit sign of this relationship though the evaluation be limited by poor detector sensitivity the filter act to permit only a small range of wavelength to be transmit around a specify central wavelength the experimental data produce value of 580 nm and 543.5 nm for the yellow and green filter respectively the standard error on these wavelength be 15 nm which be significantly wider than the simulated 5 nm this be thought to be due to variation in the detector sample step however the determine central wavelength match specification value which support this method of spectroscopy use an interferometer t he spectrometer be an instrument central to numerous field of science use to disperse light into a spectrum of it constituent wavelength the spectrometer provide a mechanism for determine property of light source this have far-reaching impact for a material heat to the point of incandescence it spectrum be characteristic of it elemental composition spectroscopy have historically aid the discovery of new element such a caesium and rubidium 1 and the development of new technology such a neon light 2 the development of spectroscopy be far influential in physic the emission spectrum of white light be unusual in that the total energy be not equally distribute among all frequency spur the development of quantum mechanic in this experiment a michelson interferometer be use a a spectrometer this possibility arises from the mathematics of fourier transforms where position space be convert to frequency or wavelength space transform the interferogram a plot of amplitude against position therefore provide a method of recreate the original spectrum of light go into the interferometer a tungsten white light source have a spectrum that be often model a that of a blackbody so study it interferogram and fourier transform to wavelength space can evaluate the extent to which this be correct since the star and planet be often model a blackbody where the elemental composition of the body influence the emission spectrum the action of filter on the tungsten spectrum have significance and can be explore the success of the result can therefore be interpret a a test for the efficacy of this method of spectroscopy a michelson interferometer consists of a light source beamsplitter two mirror and a detector a show in fig 1 the beamsplitter which be make up of two adjacent prism allows the light beam from the source to be split into two beam of approximately equal intensity one beam a travel to the mirror m 1 and the other b travel to the mirror m 2 upon which they be both reflect the two beam return to the beamsplitter and undergo a partial reflection and recombination interfere a they recombine the recombine beam can be image on white card the difference in distance between each mirror and the beamsplitter be represent by t. for a plane monochromatic wave with wavelength λ if t be equal to zero which be know a the 'null point or t be an integer multiple of λ then the two beam will constructively interfere if t be equal to an odd integer multiple of λ 2 then destructively interference will occur this produce an interference pattern a series of dark and light fringe if mirror m 2 be exactly perpendicular to beam b cylindrical symmetry allows haidinger fringe to form 3 which appear a concentric cylindrical circle a show in fig 2. mirror m 1 can be motorise in order to slowly alter the distance t. the detector can then scan over a range of t value and measure the intensity at that point to produce an interferogram for a monochromatic source this interferogram will appear a a sine wave however if the light source be not monochromatic but contains two distinct frequency the resultant interferogram will be modulate wave of both frequency leave the source with the same phase but will only have the same phase upon reach the detector if t be equal to zero or an integer multiple of both wavelength if use a source with many wavelength such a a white light emit diode the modulation will increase in number until the interferogram have a gaussian appearance all of these interferograms in position-space be related to the spectrum of the light source in frequency space by a fourier transform by fourier transform the output interferogram of any source it be possible to reclaim the original spectrum the michelson interferometer can thus be use a a spectrometer when the distance between the two mirror and the beamsplitter be unequal the two light beam recombine at the beamsplitter with a path difference the coherence length of the light source be define a follow for a difference in path length between the two beam great than the coherence length phase relation between two different ray become random 5 a a result for distance from the null point great than the coherence length no interference be detect the peak on the resultant interferogram therefore have a width approximately equal to the coherence length if the light contains a very limited range of frequency such a that from a green laser the coherence length be very large which produce a wide interferogram for a light source contain many different wavelength such a a white lightemitting diode the resultant interferogram have a narrow peak a tungsten white light source have an output that approximates to a blackbody radiation spectrum the tungsten source use in this experiment provide a constant-intensity spectrum from 360 to 2600 nanometre reference thorlabs it spectrum be claimed to most closely resemble a blackbody at 2796k 6 the temperature t be inversely proportional to the peak wavelength λ peak 7 and be give by where b be stefan 's constant which be equal to 2.898 × 10 − 3 km to 3.s.f a filter act to restrict the wavelength allow through it two filter be available a green filter with a central wavelength of 543.5 nanometre and a yellow filter with a central wavelength of 580 nanometre both have a full width at half maximum of 10 nanometre and have a characteristic gaussian transmission spectrum 8 since few wavelength be present the coherence length increase so the interference pattern appear over a wider range of mirror position the predict spectrum of a tungsten source with filter be assume to be give by the convolution of the tungsten spectrum and the filter transmission spectrum 9 since the transmission range of each filter be so narrow approximately ten nanometre compare to the overall range of the tungsten lamp there be little noticeable difference between the convolute output and original gaussian input however the simulation be able to be later compare to the data collect simulation for the tungsten source both with and without filter be show in fig 3. the michelson interferometer be assemble accord to fig 4. care be take to ensure that all component be the same height by use of a magnetic beam ruler the distance between each mirror and the beamsplitter be make approximately equal component be secure by screw them into a vibration-damping board which reduces fluctuation in the interference pattern due to external vibration clamp fork be use to far secure component correct alignment of the interferometer be essential for produce clear interference pattern a green laser of wavelength 532 nanometre be use for alignment 10 the collimation package be screw into the lens tube which itself be screw into the beamsplitter so that the light beam be exactly perpendicular to the beamsplitter prism surface first the angle of the beamsplitter be adjust so that the laser beam reflect off the centre of the move mirror the angle of the fix mirror be also adjust so that the laser beam also reflect off of it centre the detector be replace with a sheet of white card on which to image the laser beam for alignment the angle of the fix mirror be adjust in small increment until the two beam overlap on the card this card be initially held close to the beamsplitter then held at a great distance to finetune the beam overlap so that they be coincident insert a planoconvex lens expand the laser beam to a broaden source so that interference fringe be visible the angle of the fix mirror be once again finetuned so that the centre of the haidinger fringe laid at the centre of the field of view the white card be then replace with the detector which be position so that the centre of the haidinger fringe laid on the detector itself the detector be once again secure with a clamp fork and the laser replace with the tungsten white light source due to the nature of the white light tungsten source which have a wide spectrum contain numerous wavelength it be only around the null point at which there be visible interference a discus in coherence length although it be possible to scan over the whole range of the motorise mirror the slow rate at which the mirror must move to detect the interference peak make this extremely unpractical require ten of thousand of reading therefore it be useful to first find the approximate region within the mirror 's range of the null point in order to find this region the green laser be use due to it clear interference fringe at all mirror position the white card be place in front of the detector to more clearly image the fringe a the mirror move towards the null point the haidinger fringe will move towards the central bright fringe conversely fringe will move out of the centre a the mirror travel away from the null point therefore the approximate location of the null point can be determine by the direction of fringe travel in this way the null point be determine to be between −5.0 and −5.5 millimetre due to fluctuation in the position of the central fringe a the mirror approach the null point it be difficult to limit the null point to a small range however this range be deem sufficiently small over which to scan slowly with the tungsten light source in place the range of −5.0 to −5.1 millimetre be scan through at a speed of 0.01 millimetre per second and more precise location of the null point determine to then more precisely view the interference pattern the detector be scan through the new small range of −5.01 to −5.03 millimetre at a slow speed of 0.002 millimetre per second each of the two filter be place into the tungsten light source box before the light beam reach the collimation package the detector be scan initially over the same two millimetre range a previously use but this range be make large if necessary so that the whole interference pattern be in view the tungsten source with no filter produce an interferogram with gaussian shape the relevant interferograms be show in fig 5-7. unexpected modulation be present for both the yellow and green filter since the filter both have a gaussian shape wavelength transmission distribution a gaussian interferogram be expect possible reason for this discrepancy be explore in far discussion the coherence length for the tungsten source with no filter be much small than that of the tungsten source with either a green or yellow filter a see on the x-axis scale this be due to the large range of wavelength present a previously explain in coherence length a discus in theory the fourier transform of each interferogram for the tungsten source both with and without filter can recreate the spectrum of light go into the interferometer for the tungsten source with no filter fig 8. show both the simulated and experimental spectrum which be vertically scale for easy comparison the experimental spectrum appear to have a peak wavelength of approximately 780 nanometre which corresponds to a blackbody temperature of 3700k accord to 1 however the detector use have a lack of sensitivity in the infrared region correspond to wavelength between 700 nanometre and 1 millimetre it can be see by comparison with the simulation that the experimental curve would extend and peak at a high wavelength therefore the actual peak wavelength can not be determine without extreme and unsupported extrapolation the experimental spectrum for the green and yellow filter be show in fig 9. the simulated spectrum for the yellow and green filter be two narrow approximate gaussians centre on 543.5 and 580 nanometre with a standard error of 5 nanometre the experimental data do indeed lie centre on the expect wavelength

175,2ndINT_DHM538_Redacted,"we report an investigation into the spectrum of different light source use a michelson interferometer to record interferograms through which the visible spectrum can be calculate use fourier transformation ft this be do for a white lead a tungsten lamp with both green and yellow light filter and a blue lead the aim of this experiment be to determine whether use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer be an accurate method of spectroscopy for a single light source we found that the visible spectrum calculate from the ft 's of the interferograms closely match what be expect from the real spectrum with some exception meaning we can conclude that use this method of spectroscopy be accurate due to the limitation of the detector we be only able to look at the spectrum of the source for the visible range of light a the sensitivity of the detector fall off rapidly after ~1000nm ifferent source of light have different spectrum depend on how they emit light use a michelson interferometer we can obtain interferograms of the data by scan over the null point of the set up and then fourier transform this to find the spectrum this technique of interferometry be use to look at the spectrum of light be call fourier transform spectroscopy ft use three source along with two filter we observe the interferograms result from the interference of the individual light source a the distance between the two path length of the interferometer be slowly alter mechanically by a move mirror the position of the mirror and signal from the sensor be record on a computer and match together to give the data that be then fourier transform in python to give the final spectrum have prior knowledge of what the spectrum we observe should look like we can then compare our observation with the know spectrum to see whether this method of spectroscopy be accurate we also must consider that the sensor do not detect all wavelength of light equally and have a certain responsivity depend on the wavelength for silicon si detector the responsivity be roughly very similar for all make and so divide by the responsivity of the detector should give a relatively more accurate description of the spectrum once it have be fourier transform this investigation use a michelson interferometer set up a show in fig 1 to measure an interference pattern this make use of a beam splitter two adjustable mirror and a single source and detector the beam splitter split the wave come from the light source they 're then reflect and recombine at the beam splitter at which point they interfere the type of interference constructive or destructive be determine by the path difference between the split beam if the path difference be an integer multiple of 𝜆 2 then there will be dark fringe deconstructive and integer multiple of whole wavelength result in constructive interference the type of fringe see depend on the angle of the kinematic mirror and be govern by the equation where m be an integer value and t be the distance from the null point see fig 1 this result in circular fringe call haidinger fringe due to the symmetry of the situation in the plane however if the kinematic mirror be move far away from the center of the concentric circle we can see straight fringe call fizeau fringe see fig 4 the mirror m1 be adjustable to a very precise degree so that extremely small path difference can be measure by scan over a small range an interferogram of intensity v distance can be measure this scan distance must be do across the null point the null point be the point at which the length of the two arm of the interferometer be equal distance and so the path difference between the split beam be equal this be important because for a broad range of 1 ~r wwg666w66 ~~- frequency of light the distance over which all the individual frequency will interfere be very small the coherence length and on the order of micrometer for white light the coherence length be define a the propagation distance over which the coherence have significantly decayed and be different for each source of light the significant decay can be see on the interferogram a the fwhm of the a gaussian fit over the interferogram use the equation i jzlnz i .. 161 z n n,1 t where n be the refractive index and ,1 v a be the standard deviation/mean of the wavelength provide it be a gaussian therefore by fitting a gaussian to the fourier transfonn of the data we can obtain the coherence length a well a by look at the interferogram vo v this be evident in the fourier transfo1mation of a na11'ow gaussian spectral line go to a wider gaussian interferogram fig 2 where a gaussian in the frequency domain lead to a gaussian in the time domain to use the interferometer a a spectrometer or fourier transfo1m spectrometer we need to assume that the distance between each individual measurement take be the same a we be use a discrete fourier transform dft the discrete fourier transformation be do use the formula n-1 n=o where f x x be often the notation for the fourier transfo1mation this formula work on the assumption that the numerical distance between point be equal use a simulation within python we can model white light a gaussian distribution center at 550nm with a standard deviation of approximately 80nm after the ft of this gaussian the interferogram create from this simulation of light be show in fig 3 look at this we can see that the coherence length be extremely small and therefore the distance we will need to scan over for our source be on the order of ~l oµm a such small difference in path length make this much of a difference it be therefore very important to cot1'ectly align the interferometer so that we can obtain accurate result the lead work use electrolurninescence in a semiconductor material where light be emit from the semiconductor a cmtent pas through it these semiconductor be doped so that they have either a deficit electron hole or excess of electron and when brought together the boundaty between the conductor be a p-n j unction allow cw1•ent to only flow in one direction by dope you can create two semiconductor in the same c1ystal and a electron pa from one c1ystal to the other fill the electron hole they emit photon 2 a the lead can only emit over a short wavelength light bulb be often coat with phosphor of different colour to fonn white light the photon from the lead be absorbed and reemitted by the phosphor and a a result there be a stokes shift into a broader and a less intense spectium of a longer wavele~gth see fig 4 the tungsten lamp work by heating a tungsten filament inside to a high temperature at which it incandesces produce light of a visible wavelength the tungsten filament be ve1y thin and therefore have a high resistance this result in a large heating effect in the filament light be thermally radiate by the move charge particle within the filament emit radiation over a broad spectmm include the visible and be therefore continuous act a a black body 4 where the intensity of the filament can be approximate to plank 's law where all constant be represent by common physic nomenclature and 𝐵 𝜆 be the spectral radiance the sensor use in this experiment be a silicon photodiode that have a responsivity depend on the wavelength of light for silicon detector this be all quite a similar responsivity where thor lab give the responsivity of their detector accord to figure 4. because of this we can use a similar response function a a hypothetical model to try to adjust for the value of wavelength the main method of this experiment evolve around correctly align the interferometer and then find the null point correctly align the interferometer require all beam of light leave and go into the beam splitter be perfectly perpendicular/parallel from fig 1 we can see that the single source have it beam split and then recombine and direct at the detector the apparatus be set up a in fig 1 and it be make sure that all arm be a perpendicular a we could get them have set them up in this position a green laser be use a the source look at the green beam we adjust the kinematic mirror m2 so that they be perfectly align over the top of one another to then see the interference more clearly and to give a more even spread of light we use a lens to spread the beam a well a ground glass to diffuse the light have do this we be clearly able to see an interference pattern on the screen fig 4 where the type of fringe see depend only on the angle of the kinematic mirror eqn 2 to find the null point where t=0 in fig 1 we use the fact that when scan towards the null point the concentric circle appear to be move towards the centre of the circle this can be see from eqn 2 and vice versa by do this we could reduce the distance over which the null point could be to less than ~0.2mm now switch the light source to a white lead we scan slowly over the region in which we knew the null point to be and look at the data because the white light have a broad spectrum of light unlike the green laser the distance over which all wavelength interfere be very small small coherence length at the null point we should see a symmetrical gaussian in shape interferogram and therefore at the centre of this interferogram be the null point have found the null point we scan very slowly over this disance ~0.02mm or 20µm for all the light sources/filters the interferograns of the soucres be then put into python and a variant of the dft be use call the fast fourier transform fft to transfer the data into the wavelength spectrum where fit could be give to the data the first data obtain be the interferogram for the white light this interferogram be use to determine both the spectrum of the white lead a well a the null point for the interferometer a the distribution be relatively gaussian look at fig 7 we determine the null point to be approximately -2.87215mm from the start point of the mirror this value be use throughput our experiment a wee continuously scan either side of it look at the fwhm of the interferogram we can estimate the coherence length of the white lead to be ~0.0018mm the interferogram alone do not give u a lot more information about the spectrum of the lead but the ft show in fig 8 give u much more information look at the spectrum we can see that there be two clear peak so we have fit two gaussians over the ft. these gaussians give u the standard deviation of the wavelength a well a the mean value look at eq 2 we can then calculate the coherence length for this lead use these value obtain from the fit a this equation assumes that the source have a gaussian spectrum we have chosen to use the standard deviation and mean value of wavelength for the broader spectrum where λ=585nm and δλ= 59.1nm put these into 2 give a value of coherence length of 0.00385mm the discrepancy between these two value of coherence length be likely due to the spectrum for the white lead not be perfectly gaussian and so 2 be not valid for this case what be more interest though be compare this white lead spectrum to the know one in fig 4 look at these two we can see that the peak in the blue region from our data be much low than it should be this be likely due to the responsivity of the detector in this region with the signal not detect the wavelength however we can approximate that the responsivity of our detector be very similar to that in fig 5 and use this we can divide the value of our ft by the relative responsivity this be do for the white lead and be show in fig 9 this give u white lead that be extremely similar to the know spectrum fig 4 with the high peak in the blue spectrum however this be only an estimate of the actual spectrum a we do not know the actual responsivity of the detector we can clearly see the peak in the blue lead region and then then the stokes shift light reemitted by the phosphor coat in the lead this spectrum be likely more accurate than the unadjusted because the light observe from the lead be a very 'cool colour high colour temperature suggest that there be more blue wavelength of blue light be emit which can be see in fig 9 the response function of the detector do not change the standard deviation or mean value of the spectrum only the relative amplitude of the data and so the calculation still stand for the remain source of light the interferograms of the data be either unsymmetrical or so wide that we could not scan over the whole coherence length for the source because this the coherence length be not easily calculable from the interferograms and instead we will only use the ft 's of the data and a gaussian over them to calculate the coherence length the tungsten lamp act fourier transform be show in fig 10 look at the theoretical bb curve fit to it this be quite different to the actual value we measure this bb curve be base on the fact that the tungsten lamp act a a black body at 2796k and should act similarly even with the response function the wavelength of light still start later than they should and the ft drop dramatically after ~1000nm this could largely be due to the range of wavelength that the detector be able to view light over the actual spectrum of the tungsten lamp could be found online thorlabs 7 and show spike in the spectrum rather than it be smooth the difference from our data be likely due to the fact that the space between point on our interferogram be too small and so these dip in the spectrum be miss the coherence length for this lamp be not calculate a it be not theoretically a gaussian distribution for the blue lead we expect a relatively narrow distribution in the blue wavelength of light this be what be see on the ft and so the spectrometer be very accurate in acquire the correct data the coherence length of the blue light be found to be 5013nm which be muchg longer than the white light make sense a it have a thinner spectral width the main source of error within this experiment be the sensitivity of the detector a well a the space between data point on the interferogram by scan more slowly over the null point we would have obtain a much large range of data point and therefore a more accurate fourier transformation unfortunately this be difficult to overcome a our computer give error when try to process more than 1000 data point and so we be limited a to the resolution of our ft. the sensitivity be attempt to be account for however due to the sharp drop off after 1000nm we be unable to accurately obtain the wavelength within the high range we have use a michelson interferometer to accurately find the spectrum of various light source through fourier transform the data of interferograms we found that this method of spectrometry be accurate for the spectrum of light that we view with the limitation of the detector be the main source of discrepancy between the theoretical and actual spectrum observe the unequal space of distance between point also heavily contribute to the error within the experiment response function use for

and it spread the coherence length and spectral width compare these feature of the different light source reveals information about the different process which can lead to the emission of photon a michelson interferometer utilises the arrangement of a beamsplitter and two mirror to produce an interference pattern the layout for such an interferometer be show in fig 1. the beamsplitter be marked with o the two mirror be label with m 1 and m 2 and the detector with d. the light be split into two beam at o. the reflect beam travel to m 2 and the transmit one to m 1 both be reflect at the mirror and recombine upon return back to o from where the recombine beam be direct to d. if the source be emit monochromatic light constructive interference occurs if where om 1 be the distance between the beamsplitter and mirror m 1 om 2 be the distance between the beamsplitter and m 2 and λ be the wavelength equivalently for destructive interference the necessary condition be where the additional term 1 2 ensures that the two beam be exactly by λ out of phase since beam have to travel twice the distance of either om 1 or om 2 the setup of mirror determines the nature of fringe 1 if both mirror be perfectly perpendicular to the incident beam and be different distance apart from the beamsplitter we will observe haidinger fringe fig 2 if the mirror be equidistant from o but one of them be tilt with respect to the incident beam whereas the other be perpendicular straight fizeau fringe can be observe if both condition be fulfil a combination of haidinger and fizeau fringe will appear the spectral line shape of a lamp or lead can be well model with a gaussian since most of the broadening be due to the doppler effect 3 a result from fourier theory 4 be that a gaussian spectral feature cause a gaussian temporal feature e.i the interferogram will consequently have a gaussian shape furthermore the width of the gaussian in temporal space be inversely proportional to the width in frequency space one of the way to quantify the width of the interferogram be with the so-called coherence length which be equal to standard deviation σ of the gaussian a longer coherence length implies that the σ of the gaussian in frequency space will be narrower and will be therefore describe light within a narrower frequency range the width of the gaussian in frequency space be described by the spectral fig 2. haidinger fringe 2 width which be related to the coherence length by where ∆ν be the spectral width l be the coherence length and c be the speed of light in vacuum the spectral

assemble the component on an optical table a mirror on a move stage m 2 be fix on the table before the start of the experiment the stage enables precise control of the separation of this mirror from the beamsplitter the beamsplitter p/n ccm1-bs013m be add to the table in such a way that the reflect beam be incident on the mirror at an approximately right angle another mirror m 1 be add in such a way that the transmit beam be incident on it at an approximately right angle this be a kinematic mirror p/n km100 which can be adjust to set relative inclination of the two mirror to ensure that the mirror be perpendicular to the beam we use a green laser the laser be insert into the collimator which be connect to the beamsplitter a focus lens be place along the path in which the recombine beam travel in order to increase the resolution before use a detector we observe the interference pattern form on a wall about 2 meter away from the beamsplitter to obtain the large possible image then the orientation of the beamsplitter and tilt of m 1 be adjust until we observe only haidinger fringe with the central zero at the centre of the interference pattern the experimental setup be show in fig 3. the null point also have to be found the position of m 2 at which the emit light need the same time to travel from the beamsplitter to m 1 and m 2 at first a green laser be use to narrow down the possible range of the null point to 0.5 mm then the laser be replace with a white lead by move the stage in the narrow down range we be able to determine the position of the null point at which m 1 be at 8.632 ± 0.001 mm to obtain the interferogram for the white lead we scan in the range from 8.62mm to 8.64mm of the stage a ground glass be place in front of the source in order to evenly spread out the light in total 5 interferograms be obtain one be show in fig 4. all non-essential figure can be found in appendix a. and the mean coherence length for the white lead be however there be systematic and random error which could have have an impact on the result most notably the stage be n't move uniformly this can be show by consider the wavelength calculate from each position of the stage assume that the interferogram be produce by a single wavelength and find the wavelength which corresponds to the plot at each position we obtain a relationship a show in fig 5. the calculate wavelength depend on the position of the stage which be consequence of it uneven movement there be scratch on the mirror on the move stage which have create a systematic bias for light reflection we take care to place the detector on the left side of the interference pattern whereas the effect from scratch be mostly visible on the right side there be probably still some influence from the scratch and maybe dust but since those be hard to quantify i will only consider the effect from random error in calculation the obtain interferograms can be use to obtain the wavelength spectrum with the fast fourier transform 4 one of the wavelength spectrum be show in fig 6. the sensitivity of the detector be not constant for light with different wavelength the percentage of absorbed light versus wavelength a show in fig 7 be use to obtain the total intensity of incident light compare the wavelength spectrum show in fig 6 to the one state by the manufacturer fig 8 it be evident that the fourier transform spectroscopy give accurate result there be a overlap of the two central wavelength the ratio of the luminous intensity be not the same a possible reason for this be that ground glass be use which could have reflect different wavelength at different rate from fig 6 it be evident that there be two central wavelength in the weight spectrum therefore gaussian shape be fit to them separately use this method the wavelength peak with associate spread be obtain a show in table 2. use the data from table 2 to find the mean value 2 nm σλ 1 14.5 ± 1.7 nm λ 2 586.0 ± 5.2 nm σλ 2 61.1 ± 0.9 nm where λ 1 be the central wavelength of the first peak and σλ 1 it width λ 2 be the central wavelength of the second peak and σλ 2 the width the calculate wavelength be also use to obtain the spectral width of both peak by use eqn 4 to obtain interferograms for the blue lead the stage be move from 8.62mm to 8.66mm the procedure be repeat three time and similar interferograms be obtain a show in fig 9. by use the fast fourier transform the wavelength spectrum be obtain from each of the interferograms one of the spectrum with a fit gaussian be show in fig 10. the wavelength spectrum be use to obtain the central wavelength and it spread λ blue 466.8 1.1 nm σλ blue 14.4 0.1 nm where λ blue be the central wavelength and σλ blue be it width accord to the manufacturer 6 the dominant wavelength be at 470 nm which show that the experiment be in agreement with literature value the coherence length for the blue lead be longer than for the white lead this be in agreement with our expectation blue light consists only of wavelength in the blue domain of the spectrum whereas white light consists of all wavelength in the visible spectrum hence the spread of the blue lead spectrum be narrower this lead to a wider interferogram and a longer coherence length with the tungsten lamp a the source the stage be move from 8.62mm to 8.64mm twice one of the interferograms be show in fig 11. the spectrum give by the manufacturer be quite broad and should approximately obey planck 's radiation law 7 a show in fig 12. from the interferogram data the calculate coherence length of the tungsten source be since the spectrum follow the black-body emission distribution it be more reasonable to quantify the distribution of wavelength in term of colour temperature than with spectral width a fast fourier transform be use to obtain the wavelength a show in fig 13. since the data should follow planck 's radiation law the appropriate function be fit however the data do not obey planck 's law to the same degree a state by the manufacturer a major limitation in this part of the experiment be that the detector can only detect light with wavelength from 300 to 1100 nm whereas source be emit light with wavelength in the range from 300 to 2600 nm furthermore the spectral sensitivity be very low at both end of the detectable spectrum which could lead to inaccurate data it be possible to estimate the temperature of the heat tungsten filament with two method one be by use the temperature base on the black-body radiation fit to the data the other one be by use wien 's law 8 which be usually state a where λ max be the wavelength of the spectrum with the high intensity t the temperature of the object and b wien 's constant accord to the fit function the temperature of tungsten be t 2688.4 ± 8.3 k but by use the λ max and wien 's law λ max 831.1 ± 2.1 nm =⇒ t 3486.9 ±8.8 k accord to the manufacturer the colour temperature of the lamp be approximately 2796 k 7 the temperature obtain from the fit function be closer to the literature value however both of the calculate temperature differ significantly from the true value this be most likely due to the fact that the whole range of emit wavelength could be detect which would have result in a more accurate fit in comparison of all the source tungsten have the shortest coherence length whereas the blue lead have the long one the use method give accurate and precise result for the lead source but be not sufficiently precise for the tungsten lamp since more than half of it wavelength spectrum be not detect the major limitation of the method be the spectral sensitivity of the detector and the uneven motion of the stage to improve the experimental setup a motion sensor could be use in combination with the light detector to precisely measure the position of the stage at each intensity reading take more measurement for each source could have even more reduce the error from the motion of the stage since it be random recreate spectral sensitivity of the detector the spectral sensitivity of the detector be recreate by use several point from the graph in fig 7 to recreate the function with a polynomial

happens strongly at around the point at which the arm be of exactly equal length the 'null point and a such this region be typically what be present in an interferogram in order to extract the

main text provide the spectrum which best match the output of the lamp a state by the manufacturer and confirm by fitting a cw-ve to data provide for the output spectrum 6 there be a large discrepancy between the measure specf lum and the theoretical blackbody radiation this be explain by consider the wavelength-dependent sensitivity of the semiconductor detector use it relative sensitivity be displayed in figure 4 7 the blackbody specf lum be multiply by this sensitivity provide the theoretical specf lum that the detector could record in figure 5 the fourier transfom1s of the data collect with the two colour filter be present gaussian fit be make to the data set base on the online literature available for the filter suggest a gaussian disn•ibution to be an accurate approximate to the transmit spectrum 8 the figure be approximate a two linear section when apply to the blackbody spectrum take from 7 the peak wavelength and full width at half maximum fwhm for the yellow and green filter data be present in table 1. the unce1tainties be found from the covariance matrix calculate by the function use to fit the gaussian distribution to the data there be a few issue with both the experiment and the analysis lead to unce1tainties in the result firstly the linear stage do not move at a steady rate by observe the interferogram data closely a in figure 6 data be present in clump due to the non-constant motion of the stage the figtll e 5 -wavelength spectrum of tungsten lamp with yellow and green glass filter gaussian fit have be make with difficulty due to the noise in the data python function use to perform the fast fourier transform scipy.fftpack fft assumes a uniform distance between each sample whilst the detector sample at uniform time interval the motion of the stage mean this be not true for the distance between data point this false assumption within the analysis could lead to an inaccurate spectrum furthermore the range over which the interferometer be scan have an impact on the fourier transform calculate longer wavelength feature can only be identify if the mirror be move over a wider range it be possible that the range use in this experiment be not large enough to accurately reproduce the wavelength spectrum despite measure make to reduce this a well a this the tungsten lamp be not a perfect blackbody emitter and so the reconstruct spectrum would not be expect to match that of a perfect blackbody either so not all difference be due to experimental fault the fourier transforms of the data for the colour filter show several large spike lead to a difficulty fitting a gaussian function to them and therefore a lack of confidence in the fwhm of the spectrum this be propose a be cause by interference from light reflect within the setup use the large light source such a the tungsten source the beam of light be large than the mirror in the interferometer and therefore could have reflect off component unpredictably into the detector cause extra feature in the spectrum the filter also greatly reduces the intensity of the light the signal be therefore a much low amplitude and a such more sensitive to noise especially from vibration and knock of the work surface which be hard to minimise within the busy laboratory a can be see there be a general correspondence between the record data and the adjust blackbody spectrum whilst no quantitative conclusion about the match be achieve a qualitative observation of the two spectrum suggests confidence in the experimental procedure accounting for the source of error discus this suggests a correct understand of the method of light production in the lamp and justifies the approach of approximate the lamp a a black body emitter the quote value of the peak wavelength and fwhm of the yellow and green filter be present in table 2. compare these to the experimental value in table 1 there be an agreement between the experimental data and the quote value for the peak wavelength of both filter however the fwhm measurement differ by 49σ and 33σ from the quote range for the yellow and green filter respectively apply a non-uniform fourier transform would improve the analysis of the data by recreate a more accurate spectrum give more time run scan over a great range may also have improve spectrum,extended,exp
178,2ndINT_GXI055_Redacted,use fourier transform spectroscopy the wavelength of a blue lead have be identify a 461 ± 13nm the characteristic of a white light lead source have also be identify with two peak one at 447 ± 10nm and one at 567 ± 44nm our conclusion be that the white lead have be create by have a blue lead with a coat on top this coat effectively absorbs and re-emits photon within a spectrum give the other broad peak the combination of both peak be interpret a white light the importance of this find be that this method of produce lead 's can be apply in a real world context in order to more efficiently produce white light we have also verify a michelson interferometer use a a spectrometer w hite light be particularly useful in a modern day context so consequently it be of interest to create white light source a efficiently a possible over the past hundred year the cost of a lightbulb have dramatically fall 1 and in this investigation the use of lead 's to create white light will be explore lead 's be a significantly more effective way to generate light a they last longer than conventional incandescent light and also produce far less heat meaning more energy be convert to light it be therefore of interest to create method to give off white light 1 lead 's typically emit photon with well-defined wavelength a will be outline in this report the aim of this report be to classify different light source use a michelson interferometer to create a spectrum via fourier transforms spectrum 's for white and blue lead 's will be take and compare to result that be well agree upon the apparatus be set up a be show in figure 1. this be a michelson interferometer the beam be split into two light beam of equal intensity so half of the light go to each mirror the light be then combine and direct towards the detector it be assume that the mirror be parallel to one another if the distance between each of the mirror and the beamsplitter be n't equal the two light beam will half a phase difference and a path difference d. for the purpose of simplicity the light be now assume to be monochromatic with light of a single wavelength it fig 1 a michelson interferometer with both movable and tiltable mirror 2 can be show that the intensity of the light at the detector be represent by equation 1. in equation 1 a represent the amplitude of each of the ray represent the phase difference and i represent the intensity at the detector we can relate path difference d and phase difference a be show in equation 2. in equation 2 be the wavelength of the light and alpha be the angle between the beam direction and the view angle if the phase difference be a multiple of 2⇡ then the phase difference be equivalent to be equal to 0. this be because of the sinusoidal nature of light wave when we have a system such a a michelson interferometer a pattern of circular fringe be see at the detector when d 6 0 know a haidinger fringe 2 the reason for this pattern be that in the middle of the circle the view angle ↵ will be equal to 0. however far out from the centre of the circle the view angle ↵ change therefore slight change in phase occur cause light and dark circle if we assume that ↵ be approximately 0 equation 1 and 2 can be combine with the use of trigonometric identity equation 3 can be derive equation 3 be only valid when the angle ↵ be very small meaning that it be only valid when place the detector in the middle of the circular fringe previously the simplification be make that the light be monochromatic however this will rarely be the case in order to generate an equation for intensity over all the wavelength the integral must be take over all those wavelength to simplify the notation we use wavenumber notation 1/ the symbol q will be use where q 2a 2 consequently we derive equation 4. it can be see in equation 4 that the first part be constant however the second part varies a d change when the mirror move the second part what we will use go forward it will be define by i variable d use fourier transforms we can directly find the spectrum of the wavelength of light a be show in equation 5 3 this be the theoretical way to find the wavelength of the light a well a the relative intensity of the wavelength the introduction of the fourier transform mean that the michelson interferometer be know a a fourier transform spectroscope 2 it can also be see from equation 5 that the broader the spectrum of the light the narrower the interferogram would be at the null point if the light be monochromatic the value of i variable would just be a single cosine function however if the light source be a spectrum the integral would equal a superposition of cosine function with slightly different frequency this be show in figure 2 and 3. we can see from these simulation that the large the width of the wavelength spectrum the high the localisation of the amplitude around the null point 3 a light emit diode lead be a semiconductor that be able to emit light when a voltage be pas through in the direction of the current that be need for the lead to emit light be forward bias here we connect a dc current so the positive end join the p-type side whereas the negative join the n-type side this have the effect of push electron and hole across the junction when these electron and hole recombine a photon be produce whose wavelength corresponds to the size of the energy gap for this reason an lead will have very little variation in the wavelength of light it produce 4 white light do n't have a specific wavelength it instead be a blend of different wavelength from across the visible spectrum therefore various method exist in which a white light lead can be create the most straightforward method of create a white lead be to simply combine different lead 's that emit different wavelength from across the visible spectrum the superposition of this will appear a white light this be commonly do with an rgb lead red green and blue the disadvantage of this be that it require more hardware a 3 lead 's be require 5 a more common method be to take a high energy lead with a short wavelength and coat the surface of the lead with an element such a phosphor when the photon from the lead be absorbed the phosphor emits a photon with a wavelength low than that of the original this be know a scintillation the combination of the emit photon and the high energy photon that do n't get absorbed by the phosphorus produce light that appear white however a spectrum of the light will produce two distinct peak one much wider than the other 6 in order to carry out this experiment a michelson interferometer be require a diagram of this setup be show in figure 1. here it can be see that the source initially shine light towards the partially silver surface where half of the light be reflect to mirror a while the other half pas through to mirror b. the light be then reflect and shin back towards the partially silver surface this light be then recombine and shin towards the detector if distance t 0 the path difference between the two light path will equal zero a the distance between the partially silver surface and both the mirror will equal d. when the distance be t 6 0 the path difference d 2t a the light be reflect so travel twice the extra distance mirror b be tiltable to ensure that the mirror can be correctly align so that the angle between their surface will be equal to 90 in order to prevent light leak to the detector through reflection black non-reflective wall be place around the system a well a black card place around the source this also prevent excess light from leak inside the system although the vast majority of light be turn off in the room where the experiment be take place the photodetector that be use have a sample rate of 50hz with the minimum distance move in between sample of 20nm the photodetector also have an adjustable gain which we use to ensure the minimum amount of noise so that we could produce the high quality data the photodetector have a wavelength sensitivity profile a outline in figure 4. it can be see that the sensitivity quickly drop off after fig 4 relative spectral sensitivity of the photodetector use in our michelson interferometer 7 approximately 900nm so this would be take into account if spectrum run into this range be encounter the photodetector also have a gradually increase sensitivity from 400 900nm however a sharp peak be expect this wo n't be account for this a it wo n't drastically change the pattern two source be use a white lead and a blue lead for every source the null point be found about which the path difference be zero an interferogram be take around this point so that a spectrum could be produce a outline in section ii the spectrum be then inspect after which a fit be apply if it appear it follow a gaussian distribution or the shape of a blackbody spectrum after carry out the experiment a be outline in section iii the blue lead spectrum be found to have a thin gaussian shape a be show in figure 6. the mean wavelength be found to be 461nm with a sigma of 13nm the generally accepted wavelength of blue light be 450 490nm 8 meaning that this value agrees with this it can be see from these result that the blue lead emits a very narrow range of wavelength a would be expect a outline in the theory section of this report the interferogram for blue light be show in figure 5. also investigate be the spectrum of the white lead the spectrum be show in figure 8. a gaussian fit be not apply here a clearly the spectrum be not gaussian it be easily observe that the range of wavelength that be observe here be considerably longer than that of the blue lead a would be expect similarly the distribution of those wavelength be not equal a there be a peak at approximately 447 ± 10nm and a considerably large peak at approximately 567 ± 44nm this large peak also have a more broad range of wavelength the interferogram can be see in figure 7. a be expect a outline in section ii.a the white interferogram be more localise around the null point the relative amplitude of the peak in the blue lead be considerably high than that of the white light it be approximately 10 5 time high in magnitude a can be see from figure 6 and 8. this could be due to the fact that the gain on the photodetector be not set at the same level during the collection of these two datasets if the two spectrum be overlayed onto one another and the amplitude adjust so that they be approximately equal an interest pattern can be see this be show in figure 9. clearly it can be see here that the small peak in the white light spectrum corresponds to approximately the same wavelength a peak from the blue spectrum from this find a well a the fact another broad large peak be observe the white lead be likely to be compose of a blue lead with a phosphorus coat on the outside a be outline in section ii.b of this report white light would be produce here a blue photon would be absorbed into the phosphorus and a large range of photon would then be remit in this lead in particular from figure 8 it can be see that the vast majority of photon from the blue lead be absorbed a the relative amplitude of the other peak be significantly great in magnitude interestingly we can see in the same fig 9 combine spectrum for white lead and blue lead note that the amplitude have be adjust to make the peak approximately the same height figure that before the first peak we see lot of little peak some correspond to wavelength more energetic than the visible spectrum a significant part of the spectrum do not have a wavelength 900nm so the data be not change a be talk about in section iii.a far investigation would aim to find out the source of these peak a currently they ca n't be explain it be possible that they arise due to error with the equipment or method however they be not see in any other spectrum so this be unlikely in conclusion the use of a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer use fourier transforms have be verify this be because good data that agrees with establish find on the characteristic of both white and blue lead 's have be verify also conclude be the nature of the white light lead that we be give this lead be highly likely to be a blue lead with a coat around it which absorbs then re-emits light with a slightly decrease energy meaning a longer wavelength if this experiment be to be repeat there be several way in which it could be improve the first be that if possible a detector with a more even range of sensitivity should be use the current detector would make characterise light with a more broad range of wavelength very difficult due to the very different relative intensity secondly when carry out this experiment it be notice that minimal movement affected the result significantly a this be do with student walk around and lean on the table where the experiment be conduct a good chance exists that this affected our result ideally this experiment would be do in an isolated room with minimise external movement,superficial,bal
