22,2ndINT_QMC249_Redacted,in this report we investigate the physic behind two different light source namely light emit diode lead and a white light tungsten source this be do by utilise a michelson interferometer we then examine the interferograms of each light source from which the mean wavelength and the spectral width for each light source be found by take a fast fourier transform t here exists many different type of light source and not surprisingly many of them operate differently and be govern by different physical law or process one of the light source most commonly use today be light emit diode lead lead be know for it high energy efficiency compact size and improve lifetime amongst other advantage it be therefore not a surprise that lead have widespread application range from traffic light to electronic display another type of light source be incandescent lamp which have be around for much longer compare to lead and be have a comparatively high energy consumption in this experiment lead and an incandescent lamp with a tungsten filament be use a the source for a michelson interferometer the position of one of the mirror be varied to obtain an interferogram by take a fast fourier transform fft of the interferograms the spectral distribution of the light come from each source be able to be obtain with the spectral distribution we be able to characterise each light source by find their mean wavelength peak wavelength and spectral width very simply an lead work by electron in a semiconductor move from a high energy 'conduction band into electron hole an empty state where an electron can exist within a low energy 'valence band in response to a current passing through the lead this result in the emission of a photon with an energy correspond to band gap of the semiconductor which be the energy difference between the maximum of the valence band and the minimum of the conduction band the wavelength of the photon emit follow the simple relation where ∆e be the band gap of the semiconductor h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light in a vacuum and λ be the wavelength of the photon emit on the other hand an incandescent lamp work by heating a filament to a temperature high enough such that the filament begin to emit visible light a such they can be model a a blackbody which be an idealise surface that can theoretically absorb all incoming radiation a blackbody emits blackbody radiation a continuous spectrum of light mathematically described by planck 's radiation law where i λ t be the spectral emittance of the blackbody unit w m −3 which be the intensity per unit wavelength λ be wavelength t be the absolute temperature of the blackbody h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light in a vacuum and k b be the boltzmann constant fig 1 show illustrates the general shape of a blackbody emit blackbody radiation we can integrate across all possible wavelength to find the total radiate intensity to obtain the stefan-boltzmann law which state that the total intensity i radiate by a blackbody be proportional to the fourth power of the blackbody 's absolute temperature where σ another law govern blackbody radiation be wien 's displacement law which relates the peak wavelength λ peak emit by a blackbody with it absolute temperature and be give by where b be a constant know a wien 's wavelength displacement law constant and have a value of the michelson interferometer setup be show in fig 2. if an observer view the mirror at an angle θ a show in fig 3 then the angle θ at which constructive interference occurs can be related to t the distance by which a moveable mirror move by the equation where m be an integer know a the order of interference a proof of this be give in appendix a. if t 0 then the left hand side of equation 8 be zero but this mean that co θ can take any value and so constructive interference should occur at all value of θ therefore the intensity a measure by the detector should be at a maximum this be know a the 'null point i.e the point at which t 0. a fourier transform decomposes a superposition into it constituent part whilst give the relative contribution of each part this be illustrate in fig 4. in this experiment the interferogram be the superposition so the fourier transform allows u to obtain the spectral distribution of the light source and find out which individual wavelength contribute the most to the light emit by the source one convention for write the fourier transform be a follow where f f x represent a fourier transform operate on f x whereas g ω be the fourier transform of f x note that this be the continuous fourier transform the interferogram be make up of discrete point so in reality a discrete fourier transform be take the interferometer be first setup a show in fig 2 and then place such that mirror 1 and 2 m1 and m2 be a close a possible to equidistant from the beam splitter mirror 2 be fix onto a moveable linear stage and so be use to vary t. alignment of the interferometer be do use a green laser and lens while the mirror would be carefully adjust this would make sure the mirror be parallel and perpendicular with the source and detector when the interferometer be properly align circular fringe know a haidinger fringe would appear and be make to be centre at the detector the green laser be then switch for a white lead and the lens would be remove the next step be to find the null point of the interferometer which be do by move m2 slowly over a certain range until a spike in the interferogram be found four interferograms be then take about the null point at a speed of 0.001 mm s −1 this be repeat for a blue lead a tungsten white light source a well a the same tungsten light source with a green filter add although the gain on the detector have to be increase for the tungsten source since the emit light have less intensity compare to the lead a fast fourier transform fft be take of each of these interferograms use the interferograms and their ffts the mean wavelength and spectral width be found for each source mean wavelength be calculate use three different method the first be to assume that the interferogram and it fft would be approximately gaussian so the mean wavelength would be equal to the peak wavelength the second be to take a weight mean base on the spectral distribution produce by the fft this be do use the formula where i λ be the spectral emittance for a give wavelength λ. the third and last method be to look at the interferogram about the null point and measure the distance between adjacent peak due to the factor of 2 in 8 the mean wavelength would be twice that distance for purpose of reduce random error the mean wavelength be calculate by take the two peak which be five peak away from the null point measure the distance between them and divide by 10. specifically if p i be the ith peak from the null point where in this notation the null point would be p 0 and λ pi be the wavelength correspond to peak p i then the mean wavelength would be give by the spectral width of each source be found by simply find the full width at half maximum fwhm of the spectral distribution produce by the fft a. result and error 1 mean wavelength table 1 show the value for the mean wavelength for each light source calculate use the three method outline in the method section blue lead 32±1 tungsten source with green filter 40±4 2 spectral width table 2 show the value for the spectral width for the lead and the tungsten source whereas for the tungsten source with a green filter it show it value for the spectral width of the green filter 3 tungsten filament temperature by plug the peak wavelength for the tungsten source in table 1 into 6 we can now estimate the temperature of the tungsten filament and so have an estimate value of t 3560 ± 9 k. appendix b and c contains sample interferograms and spectral distribution obtain by the fourier transform respectively from each of the light source the white lead have value for the mean wavelength in generally the 500-600 nm range which be to be expect consider the visible light spectrum range from about 380 to 750 nm which implies a mean wavelength of about 565 nm on the other hand the blue lead have value at around 450 nm a well a a low 414 nm use a wavelength to colour calculator we can see that 414 nm corresponds to violet whereas 450 nm be dark blue this be contrary to the lead which be a light blue colour and should correspond to about 480 nm the tungsten white light source show a mean wavelength of about 810 nm which be actually outside of the visible light spectrum but this be not too surprising if we recall that the tungsten source can be model a a blackbody and so would radiate wavelength outside of the visible spectrum moreover since the distribution in planck 's law be positively skewed we would expect that the mean wavelength would become big which be what we obtain the tungsten white light source with the green filter have a peak wavelength of about 530-540 nm which be just about what be expect since the wavelength range corresponds to a light green but it have a mean wavelength of 2200 nm which be outside the visible spectrum if we look at fig 14 in appendix b which show the spectral distribution we see that there be a significant contribution from high wavelength besides the peak wavelength which positively skews the mean wavelength result in the high result for the mean wavelength in regard to the spectral width we have found that the blue lead and the tungsten source with the green filter have the small spectral width follow by the white lead and then the tungsten source this be not unexpected since the blue lead and filter tungsten source would emit mostly light of a narrow range of wavelength whereas the others would emit white light which span a great range of wavelength and so they would have a large spectral width moreover the tungsten source have a large spectral width compare to the white lead because once again the tungsten source can be model a a blackbody and so it emits a great range of wavelength compare to the white lead which be constrain by the band gap of the semiconductor we estimate the temperature of the tungsten filament of the tungsten source to be about 3560 k. note that this be below tungsten 's melt point of about 3687 k so this obtain temperature be plausible other estimate place the temperature at around 3000 k it should be note that the interferograms obtain with the white lead be consistently asymmetric see fig 6 in appendix b this may be an indicator of an imperfect alignment of the michelson interferometer imperfection such a dirt on the laser or faulty electronics but another thing to not be that the spectral distribution show in fig 10 in appendix c show a double peak this may mean that it be likely a fault in the lead 's electronics perhaps brought about by a fault in the manufacturing process or the lead sustain some damage in response to a physical shock or a high current passing through it we have see that the result of the interferometry experiment largely conform to what be expect base on the theory behind these light source for instance the tungsten source spectral distribution show in fig 12 resembles the planck 's law distribution show in fig 1. in addition the mean wavelength largely conform to what be expect base on the colour of the light emit we also show that a tungsten source have a large spectral width compare to an lead which implies that more energy be waste in the tungsten source through production of wavelength outside the visible spectrum moreover the obtain estimate for the temperature of the tungsten filament be also within the range of plausibility it can be conclude that incandescent lamp be inferior to lead since the former waste comparatively more energy through the emission of wavelength in the infrared spectrum a well a have a less well define spectral distribution compare to lead in fig 5 it can be see that the extra distance the low ray travel compare to the upper ray be 2α − β. use some trigonometry α and β can be show to be consider the path difference be an integer number m of wavelength for constructive interference we obtain mλ 2t co θ a require many thanks to andrew lee for his

55,2ndINT_PLS878_Redacted,the aim of the experiment be to determine property of lead and tungsten lamp source use interferometry this be do by shin light from these source into an interferometer and then fast fourier transform the interferograms to obtain wavelength spectrum for the light through fitting a gaussian to the spectral peak we obtain the mean wavelength and spectral width of the light for the tungsten lamp we obtain a mean wavelength of 856±59 nm and spectral width of 279 nm for the blue lead we found a wavelength of 464±10 nm and a spectral width of 23 nm and for the white lead we found a wavelength of 595±50 nm and a spectral width of 140 nm likewise for the green and yellow filter tungsten lamp we obtain mean wavelength of 544±13 nm and 583±18 nm and spectral width of 39 nm and 28 nm respectively these result agree with the expect mean wavelength and spectral width to test the black body nature of the tungsten lamp we subject it to wiens displacement law and derive a temperature of 3389±234 k which do not contain the state value of 2796 k within it error range this difference be likely down to the inability of the detector to detect in infrared range he main objective of the experiment be to determine property of light source such a the mean wavelength emit and the spectral width use interferometry this be do by feed light from a variety of different source into an interferometer the interference pattern be detect by a photodetector and then fourier transform through computer code for the analysis 1 this allow a wavelength spectrum to be produce along with the result on the mean wavelength and spectral width the investigation be important a it enables the property of a light beam to be deduce when no other effect be present so a to act a a comparison for far interferometry experiment such a the detection of gravitational wave by ligo 2 the michelson interferometer work by splitting a light beam into 2 distinctive beam reflect them off 2 perpendicular mirror and then recombine the beam when they be at right angle to each other plane wave recombine will interfere and the interference pattern will be determine by the path difference between the 2 beam from their respective mirror to where they recombine if the path difference be an integer number of wavelength then the beam will meet in phase to constructively interfere to form a bright fringe if the path difference be a half integer number of wavelength then the beam will meet completely out of phase and destructively interfere to form a dark fringe in addition to this the orientation of the mirror determines the shape of the fringe have the mirror perpendicular to each-other creates a cylindrical symmetry for the reflect light result in circular haidinger fringe by tilt one of the mirror the cylindrical symmetry be broken so straight line fizeau fringe will be form instead 1 deduce property of light source use interferometry -- va1ying the path difference of monochromatic plane wave light ie by shift the position of one of the minor will result in a se1ies of alternate bright and dark fi.inges with an amplitude that increase to a maximum at the null point where the path difference be 0. alternatively use light make up of 2 frequency will produce the same pattern of bright and dark fringe but with an amplitude that modulates a show in figure 1. a fomier transfo1m of these amplitude signal will generate the frequency that make it up in the fo1m of spectral line conesponding to the separate wavelength of light that constitute the beam the broader the spectral line the nanower the interferogram i these spectral line can be approximate a gaussian an approximation that be most fitting for lamp emit light in this case the mean wavelength can be approximate from the peak wavelength of the gaussian and the spectral width can be found use where bj be the spectral width and fwhm be the full width at half maximum namely the width of the gaussian at half it 's height the spectral width be a measure of the range of frequency emit by the source i lose energy and emit photon of a specific frequency to generate a ce1tain colour in order to fo1m white light lead 's often contain multiple chip of different colour which combine to fo1m white light 4 the equipment be set up a show in figure 3. great c.are be take to ensure that the minor be perpendicular to eachother and that the light beam be perpendicular to the mi1rnrs to ensure a clear inte1ference pattern this be initially do by eye with the aid of the magnetic mler which help to align all component conectly finer tune be do by turn on the green laser and alter the 01ientation of one of the minor until clear circular haidinger fringe be see for this a lens be use to expand the beam into a broaden source to make the fringe clearer the mobile minor stage be then move over it entire 20mm range until we obse1ved a change in the direction of movement of the haidinger fringe to indicate the presence of the null point and the procedure be redone with a small range ultimately we scan through the small length with the white lead until we saw a large increase in the amplitude of the interferogram highlight the null point position this be necessa1y so that all the spectroscopy expe1iments could be perfo1med around the null point to allow u to obtain the large amplitude inte1ferograms which could then be fast fourier transform to produce spectral line for analysis i essentially the only interest data be around the null tungsten lamp source work by heating up a tungsten filament by passing electricity through it to the point that it emits light continuously in this way it behaves a a black body emitter and would be expect to emit all wavelength of light a a black body the wavelength emit by the tungsten lamp would follow wiens displacement law give by where t be the temperature and a.peak be the peak wavelength i point the green laser be then replace with a blue lead and the minor stage be set to move a few tenth of a millimeter through the null point position and the interferogram be obtain from the detector this procedure be then repeat for a white lead a tungsten lamp and finally a tungsten lamp with a green filter and then a yellow filter each interferogram be then cut so that only the high amplitude data around the null point be include so a to ensure that only the relevant data be fourier transform and hence accurate spectral line be obtain 1 after the interferograms be fast fourier transform gaussian curve be fit to the spectral line for the blue lead and filter tungsten lamp the mean wavelength be take from the peak wavelength on the gaussian a the light be make up of only 1 main wavelength this can not be do for the white lead and unfiltered tungsten lamp a they be comprise of multiple wavelength so the mean wavelength be calculate by measure the width of the interferogram over the null point position and then divide this by the number of wave we measure over the spectral width for each spectral peak be then found use 1 for the tungsten lamp a mean wavelength of 856±59 nm and a spectral width of 279 nm be obtain whilst for the blue lead a wavelength of 464±10 nm and a spectral width of 23 nm be found and for the white lead we deduce a wavelength of 595±50 nm and a spectral width of 140 nm for it wide peak likewise the green and yellow filter tungsten lamp produce mean wavelength of 544±13 nm and 583±18 nm and spectral width of 30 nm and 28 nm respectively the mean wavelength for the blue lead and the green filter tungsten fit comfortably within the expect wavelength range of these respective colour be 450-495 nm 5 for blue and 495-570 nm for green whilst the mean wavelength for the yellow filter tungsten be within the accepted range although it error range do exceed the limit of 570-590 nm however due to the approximate nature of the wavelength limit and the fact the error range only oversteps the yellow range by a few mm this do not raise any concern the unfiltered tungsten mean wavelength suggests the tungsten lamp mostly emits in the short wavelength infrared spectrum a can be expect from the fact it generates light by intensely heating a filament wire in addition the large spectral width highlight the fact the white tungsten light be comprise of a large number of vary wavelength due to it continuous emission a a black body this be most evident when compare to the comparatively small spectral width of blue lead and green and yellow filter tungsten which reflect the single frequency nature of the light fig 5. a graph show the wavelength spectrum for a white lead 1 both peak be fit with a gaussian fig 6. a graph show the wavelength spectrum for a blue lead 1 here a lorentzian fit would be more suitable than a gaussian fig 7. a graph show the wavelength spectrum for yellow filter tungsten lamp fit with a gaussian 1 an unexpected dip can be see a a black body emitter the tungsten lamp would be expect to follow wiens displacement law use 2 a temperature of 3389±234 k be derive for the tungsten lamp which do not contain the state value of 2796 k within it error range this discrepancy be most likely explain by the fact the detector use can not detect infrared light meaning valid data in the infrared range be exclude from the fourier transform result in the peak wavelength be small than it should be this fact also explains the difference between figure 4 and the expect black body curve namely the sharp drop of the data to 0 amplitude after a certain distance into infrared range a oppose to an asymptote with the x-axis the error introduce by this could be account for by use a detector that can detect in the infrared region for the white lead 2 peak can clearly be see in figure 5. this highlight the different method of generate white light undertook by the lead compare to the continuous emission of the tungsten lamp here each peak corresponds to the 2 wavelength of light generate by the 2 semiconductor chip within the lead which mix to form white light however the gaussian curve do not seem to fit the data a well a it do for the tungsten graph the data be sharper and narrower than the gaussian near the peak and do n't drop off a rapidly which be characteristic of a lorentzian curve 6 -this be most obvious with figure 6.the suitability of a gaussian for the tungsten graph suggests that the thermal emission of light be well model a a gaussian and so the fact gaussian curve fit the lead graph relatively well highlight thermal effect cause some light emission in the lead model the wavelength spectrum of the lead 's after a lorentzian would be a way of improve the experiment in addition to this the sensitivity of the detector result in a lot of noise be picked up this error could be reduce by repeat the experiment in an isolated room an unexpected result be obtain with the sharp dip in figure 7 and 8. this be clearly not 2 separate peak a it be obtain from monochromatic light and be unlikely to be noise due to it size meaning a point of far investigation could be to probe this range with more reading to get high resolution data the aim of the experiment be to deduce property of lead and tungsten lamp source use interferometry this be do by feed light from these source into an interferometer and then fast fourier transform the result interferogram to obtain wavelength spectrum for the light this allow u to calculate the mean wavelength and spectral width which fit the expect value base on the light colour and method of generation we also perform wiens displacement law on the tungsten lamp to test it black body behavior we obtain a temperature of 3389±234 k which differs from the state value of 2796 k. this discrepancy be likely due to the inability of the detector to detect infrared light the sensitivity of the detector also generate a lot of noise to reduce the error introduce by this i would repeat the experiment in an isolated room and use a detector which can detect infrared light fig 8. a graph show the wavelength spectrum for a green filter tungsten lamp fit with a gaussian 1 here an unexpected dip can be see,extended,the,70,0.061567027,0.938432992
46,2ndINT_GQV977_Redacted,the interferometer have be a vital tool in several scientific field since it development in the 19 th century by albert a. michelson 1 it u include find very small distance for example to find imperfection in a mirror and large one such a the diameter of distant star in term of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation use in the interferometer 2 this experiment will study the interferograms of light source of different kindsincluding those that emit black body radiation a oppose to individual wavelength due to emission line that come about from quantisationand use discrete fourier analysis to study the characteristic of the source use their interferograms e begin the experiment by set up and align the equipment in the interferometer such that one of the mirror could be move linearly by a distance 't in order to increase or decrease the path difference of two ray and therefore alter the pattern of light output by the spectrometer a schematic diagram of the michelson interferometer be a follow the mirror that can be move linearly be m1 and it distance from the beam splitter at any point in time can be found by the fix distance of m2 from the beam splitter add to the value 't which can be control via a terminal on a computer connect to a move stage we take a range of intensity reading from the detector take continuously a the stage be move by a motor these be use to produce a plot of intensity versus position which can be fourier transform by a numerical 'fft fast fourier transform into frequency space that would then produce a unique spectrum for every light source study the first step be to find the null point where t=0 i deduce mathematically that with decrease distance from the null point the haidinger fringe project on a screen would appear to move inwards we therefore advanced towards this point until the thickness of the ring decrease this enable u to eventually find the null point which lay at a stage distance of 1.014mm 4 figure 2 haidinger fringe on a screen http //www.google.co.uk/url sa=i source=imgres cd= cad=rja uact=8 ved=2ahukewip-mjlkfreahwoikykhe8yaomqjrx6bagbeau url=https 3a 2f 2f

we analyse in order to obtain four different interferograms the light source we will compare be this be an improvement on an earlier reading before we add ground glass and paper with a small aperture which look like this due to the lead 's physical structure the white tungsten filament 's interferogram a expect be very narrow because of the very wide spectrum of wavelength emit these can be described by black body radiation rather than simply emission line such a for a monochromatic lead more on this later tungsten filament can provide a broader spectrum of lightsee the coherence length comparison in the next section this method be clearly not reliable a found by these result a well a others we instead use an alternative method which defines the coherence length to be directly related to the full width at half maximum fwhm of the curve assume they be gaussian l be the standard deviation which can be show to be we therefore directly analyse our result on the computer screen to find value for the fwhm for each light source 's interferogram and take 3 repeat reading to reduce the uncertainty a follow value of fwhm µm mean/µm white lead 1. this table demonstrates that the tungsten lamp have the broad range of wavelength these be all within the visible spectrum and therefore help it to appear more 'white i.e it be more of a mix of all colour compare to the white lead the opposite argument applies for the tungsten with a yellow filter which have the narrow range of wavelength before move onto the fourier transforms of the source interferograms we can first use a result derive from fourier analysis which give a more numerical comparison of the different source range of frequency also know a the spectral width far analysis can be do once the wavelength be found from the fourier transform graph and again assume the peak to be approximately gaussian the spread of wavelength can be found a follow 3 python code be design to use the output from the detector and use these value to directly form a fourier transform not only to plot the graph of actual result the interferograms we will first analyse the transforms from the lead the white lead 's wavelength spectrum suggests a large wide peak around the red/green area and another very small bump around the blue one could think that the small peak be simply an artefact that come into existence because of the bump on the left-hand side of the interferogram but this would be wrong for one important reason white lead be expect to give this type of emission here be another typical white lead spectrum for comparison the light emit from lead be cause by phospholuminescence where an electric field cause a semiconductor to emit light 5 lead of each colour such a our blue one emit light within a very narrow spectrum due to radiative recombination explain far later in this section essentially this describes electron 'falling into hole in the valence band of a semiconductor a semiconductor due to quantisation have two separate 'bands where electron can lie the valence band and the conduction band separate by a band gap across which electron must jump in a metal there be no band gap 6 the energy of this jump give the emit photon their frequency accord to e= ℏω this phenomenon alone explains the narrow peak for the blue lead but do not explain the wide curve in the red-green region for the white lead an explanation for this be that the lead itself emits one frequency of blue light visible on the graph a well a high frequency with an even shorter wavelength and a high energy this blue light or uv however do not escape the case of the lead the case contains a phosphor which absorbs the energy of these wavelength and then emits this energy a photon with a much broader range of frequency 7 this luminescence phenomenon be know a phosphorescence 8 and can be see clearly on the white lead 's spectrum here be the wavelength spectrum of the tungsten source the pure tungsten lamp have a very broad range of wavelength range between around 500-1200nm which we will not be able to simply describe by mean of the photon emit when an electron drop from one quantise energy level to another instead an explanation for this be two successive phenomenacollision ionisation and radiative recombination -which give rise to a hot tungsten lamp 's behaviour a a black body emitter the former be cause by the movement of delocalize electron within the lattice of tungsten cation in the lamp the electron can be involve in collision with outer-shell electron and displace them which mean that the energy of ionisation be overall lose from the system and a hole be left in the ion that be now miss the electron the same collision equally apply to inner shell electron leave hole at different energy level to be fill 9 that be collision ionisation we must now look to the 'positively charge hole left by this phenomenon and how they be fill consider the sea of delocalised electron in the lamp and assume that they be in thermal equilibrium with the rest of the metal we could then describe the energy of these electron with a boltzmann distribution with a continuous spectrum of energy where most electron have a kinetic energy above the mean i.e there be a positive skew now through the process of radiative recombination any give electron can now fill a hole in any energy level of the tungsten cation to return them to their original charge this electron be now localise and have lose all it kinetic energy which a we have discus can take a continuous spectrum of value in the process of replace the lose electron the new electron will emit all it kinetic energy a a photon with it frequency obey the equation e=ℏω therefore a continuous spectrum of frequency be emit and so we see a continuous black body spectrum of wavelength 10 far analysis can be do on this black body spectrum we can first take some reading from the spectrum in figure 15 left to determine the most likely wavelength emit from the source from the fourier transform we have found that the wavelength be 2×426nm which be 852nm from this value we can use wien 's displacement law which link the peak wavelength to temperature in k. wien 's displacement constant b have empirically be show to be 2.90×10 -3 mk 11 this set the temperature of the tungsten lamp at 3.40×10 3 k 12 which we have deduce simply from fourier analysis on the lamp 's interferogram and assume it wavelength spectrum to behave exactly like that of a black body emitter add the yellow filter mean that the wavelength spectrum be immediately far narrower the peak for this spectrum ignore that the fluctuation do not affect the actual position of the peak on the graph which they do lie at approximately 2.87×2 which corresponds to a wavelength of 573nm a expect for yellow light which take an approximate range of 560-590nm 13 to explain the fluctuation around the peak we must consider the interferogram for the yellow-filtered tungsten lamp there be a beating pattern to the left and right of the main peak of the yellow light which then add the variation we see in figure 16 which affect the shape of the wavelength peakthe algorithm have picked up these unwanted frequency the fourier transforms for the interferograms for all 4 source confirm the earlier calculation which state that the unfiltered tungsten lamp have the broad range of wavelength and so it radiation bear closer resemblance to daylight compare to the white lead 14 they also confirm that the yellow-filtered tungsten light have a narrower range of wavelength than the blue lead which can now be see by directly compare the width of the two peak of the wavelength spectrum in figure 13 and 16. the interferometer succeed in find relatively accurate interferograms of the different source which could then be characterize by use of a fourier transform to provide a wavelength spectrum these spectrum provide an insight into the type of wavelength one would expect to find from different source and with different filter a well a the range cover by such emission spectrum the experiment be mostly qualitative in that it show the characteristic of each type of radiation such a show that the blue or yellow monochromatic source emit narrow line of radiation whereas black body radiation would be a more fitting model for other source such a the incandescent filament lamp there be some quantitative aspect such a find the wavelength of the source and most find the most likely wavelength from the tungsten lamp which be subsequently use to quantitatively deduce it temperature in analyse the error propagate throughout the process of find the temperature i found that the large source of error include deduce the most likely wavelength use the three repeat reading to obtain this the value be around 425.7±0.9 nm give a percentage error of 0.2 which be very small the other main error would be that of the spectrometer of the order ±0.5 15 and that of apply wien 's displacement law which be minimalized because the constant b be give accurately to 8 significant figure in the calculation we could round this percentage error to 1 and therefore say that the temperature of the tungsten lamp at thermal equilibrium reach 3.400±0.003 ×10 3 k which fit with the statement that they reach temperature of 'about 3000k drawn from 5 other scientific source 16 another small improvement to be make could be that when fourier transform the yellow-filtered tungsten 's interferogram the range could have be cropped so that the beating pattern on either side be not include and so would not produce unwanted fluctuation around the peak of the wavelength spectrum more effort could have be make in rearrange the white lead to minimize far the effect of it structure on the shape of it interferogram one final improvement would have be to alter the code early on to account for the fact that the 'wavelength plot only show half of the wavelength because of any distance move by the mirror would cause twice that difference in path length 14 tungsten imitates daylight 's visible range http //www.google.co.uk/url sa=i

3,2ndINT_CTW087_Redacted,the purpose of this experiment be to calculate the spectral profile of various light source by use a fourier transform spectrometer they be a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten lamp with a green filter attach each light source be attach to an interferometer comprise of a beam splitter a fix mirror an adjustable mirror and a detector each of the interferograms be fourier transform to find the spectral profile of the light source the principle discussion point be whether the profile reproduce the expect shape base on the physical mechanism which generate the light in each source and the individual wavelength which be present in the source the calculate wavelength for the blue lead be 478.9 nm and for the tungsten lamp with a green filter be 551.2 nm his experiment be carry out in order to calculate the spectral profile of various light source by use a michelson interferometer the interferometer be combine with python script which perform fourier transforms in order to produce spectral profile for each light source the technique implement in this experiment be integral to many aspect of scientific measurement a it allows for very precise measurement on the order of a nanometer a recently a last month interferometry be use to detect a binary neutron star merger 130 million light year away from earth the preference of an interferometer combine with a fourier transform mechanism over a spectrometer be due to the difficulty of create a tool which be able to take measurement at frequency comparable to that of light ≈ 10 14 hz this be the case with the spectrometer however a an interferometer measure interference pattern which only change at the rate specify by the observer it be prefer for high-frequency source the light source which be test where a white lead and blue lead and a tungsten lamp the underlie physical principle of this experiment be wave interference in a michelson interferometer and the emission spectrum of p-n junction and blackbody the configuration of a michelson interferometer be outline below in figure 1. light be emit from a source and divide by the partially silver mirror into two separate beam the two beam be then reflect off of either m1 or m2 the beam then recombine and interfere whether the interference be constructive or destructive be determine by the relative path and phase difference between the two ray thus interference be a very precise way of determine the relative distance between m1 and m2 a convenient way to visualize the beam interfere be by consider the two mirror a be in the same plane and light enter from an extend source this be demonstrate in figure 2. the left-hand figure demonstrates when the two mirror be perpendicular to one another and there be cylindrical symmetry the right-hand figure illustrates a tilt between the mirror and when the symmetry be broken 1 the left-hand figure illustrates when the two mirror be perpendicular to one another and there be cylindrical symmetry in the system when this happens the fringe be calculation of the spectral shape of lead and a tungsten lamp use a fourier transform spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london t concentric ring haidinger fringe when one of the mirror be tilt with respect to the other this symmetry break down and the fringe form straight line fizeau fringe in order to use the interferometer a a spectrometer measurement be take about t 0 refer to a the null point this produce a series of fringe which be detect electronically the interference pattern in fact contains all of the information require to calculate the wavelength profile of the source if a fourier transform be perform on the interference pattern it return a wavelength profile for the source 1 a fourier transform be a mathematical tool which can transform a function from spacial co-ordinate to wavelength co-ordinate hence in a complex wave pattern it be able to extract the individual wavelength of the sinusoid which superpose to form the observe wave the fourier transform return the wavelength and their relative amplitude below be the equation which be use to transform between space and wavelength here 𝑓 𝑥 be the function in spatial coordinate which be transform to return the frequency spectrum 𝑔 𝜔 2 so a monochromatic wave becomes a dirac delta under a transform a a consequence of the fourier transforms the large the width of a wavelength spectrum of a wave be the small the width of the interference pattern the distance over which the pattern be detectable be refer to a the coherence length so a white light source should in principle have a shorter coherence length than a yellow light source this be demonstrate in figure 3. in practice the wavelength spectrum be a direct consequence of the physical mechanism within a light source the emission spectrum of a solid be often well model a black body radiation unlike gas in which atom-atom interaction be negligible and atomic transition produce photon with discrete energy in a solid the atom be close enough so that it affect the energy distribution of photon make it a continuous distribution the perfect blackbody emits and absorbs across all wavelength whilst in practice this can not exist it be a useful idealization for a number of material this be the approximation which be apply to the tungsten lamp a it be a hot dense solid the profile of a black body be show below in figure 4 and it be useful to note that the temperature and peak wavelength be inversely proportional to one another a show in equation 4. λ 𝑃𝑒𝑎𝑘 × t 2.9 × 10 −3 𝑚𝐾 4 where t be temperature and λ 𝑃𝑒𝑎𝑘 be the characteristic wavelength of the spectrum 3 in a light emit diode lead many electron be excite and interact with hole the electron recombine with the hole and release a photon with an energy which be approximately that of the band gap between the valence and conduction band in that material this be well illustrate by the dispersion relation in figure 5 and the p-n diagram in figure 6. figure 5 a simplify 1 dimensional parabolic dispersion relation for a semi-conductor 5 figure 6 a p-n junction diagram which illustrates how hole and electron recombine in the middle region to produce a photon with energy equivalent to that of the band gap in figure 5 5 hence the energy and by extension frequency of photon which be release from the p-n junction be not discrete but should resemble something more akin to a narrow gaussian profile due to the nature of the band gap the experimental setup consist of a michelson interferometer and computer refer to figure 1 for detail the interferometer be connect to a computer which store data and use python to perform fourier transforms the interferometer require calibration before it could be use this meant make sure each of the beam from the source to the mirror be overlap with the other in order to minimise the error which small disturbance to the apparatus could cause the apparatus be built with a small a distance a possible between each of the individual component in order to make the fringe more visible particular lens be use to make the pattern large once locate the desire light source be screw into the apparatus and measurement be record measurement take be relatively straight forward for this experiment the moveable mirror be sent to the start location and scan through the range around the null point which be specify there be slight contention about how many measurement should be take in order to maximize the accuracy of the detection but also not so many that they become unnecessary ultimately it be decide that 30000 reading should be take across a 2 mm range it should also be note that any constant offset in the interferograms be dealt with in the fourier transform a a line near the origin which be neglect the first measurement be make on a white lead the theory predict that the shape of the interference pattern would be a narrow gaussian a white light have a broad frequency spectrum and lead 's have gaussian emission profile below be figure 7 and 8 the interferogram and fourier transform for the white lead indeed there be element of this interferogram which both agree and disagreed with the theory it do have a gaussian profile but be also asymmetric which be not predict by the theory the reason for the asymmetry be clearly displayed in figure 8. the lead be not comprise of a continuous wavelength distribution but two spike a narrow one in the blue region and a broad one in the green/yellow the reason for this unexpected profile can be found in the construction of the lead it be comprise of a uv/blue lead in it centre which be coat in a fluorescent material which absorbs uv/blue radiation and re-emits white light however the limitation of the lead be displayed in the result and it be inefficient at mix light of different wavelength 6 to test the validity of this explanation the measurement be retaken but this time a diffusion lens be attach to the apparatus to aid the mix of the light this be demonstrate in figure 9 and 10. it be not immediately evident from figure 9 that there be any noticeable change in the mix of the wavelength however the wavelength profile provide far more insight into the effect of the lens the peak which represent the blue light be far less intense than before which implies that the light be be mixed more efficiently thus the spectrometer displayed the expect wavelength profile in accordance with the p-n junction theory and the specific composition of the lead however test it ability to calculate specific wavelength be a task well suit to the use of a monochromatic light source the underlie physic of the blue lead be not very different from the white lead but it be a well way to test the spectrometer 's ability to calculate specific wavelength of light yet again a gaussian interference pattern be expect except it should have be slightly broader than the white lead figure 12 the wavelength profile for the blue lead with a peak wavelength of 478.9 nm the measure peak wavelength be 478.9 nm the interferogram be indeed a gaussian shape a predict and broader than the white lead interferogram the fourier transform produce figure 12 which indicates one prominent wavelength of 478.9 nm this be compare to the value give on the lead 's datasheet which be 470 ≤ λ ≤ 475 nm 7 there be two significant reason which for the error in the measure value the first be that the reading for stage distance be inaccurate a the stage do not measure the correct distance this may have introduce a positive or negative shift in the interferogram and the wavelength profile perhaps even more significantly the detector which be use in this experiment have a wavelength dependent sensitivity this be show in figure 13. this profile suggests that blue light be not detect a well a longer wavelength and thus the wavelength which be calculate be shift towards the longer wavelength a potential correction could be a deconvolution with this profile and the calculate fourier transform however the exact sensitivity profile be not accessible and hence this extension be not attempt the final part of the investigation analyse the effect of a filter on a wavelength profile of a tungsten lamp the result display the predict sink function and the wavelength profile be a sharp peak in the green region the exact wavelength be 551.2 nm the wavelength which be give in the datasheet be 543.5 ± 2 nm 9 yet again the reason for this error be due to the detector and the moveable stage however a well a that the tungsten lamp undergoes heating and become less efficient with time this manifest itself a an incline in the interferogram it be positive a the stage be move from the righthand side of the graph to the left hence this introduces error into the result which be difficult to quantify this be test by move the stage and take measurement start at each end of the range left to right and right to left and confirm upon observe that the decline in intensity exist in both with increase distance overall the result of this experiment be quite successful the observe wavelength profile match the theory quite well all of the predict feature of the profile their shape and peak wavelength 478.9 nm for the blue lead and 551.2 nm for the green filter tungsten lamp certain improvement such a add a diffusion lamp to mix light be make during the experiment but other source of error such a the defective equipment be somewhat unavoidable perhaps the only disappoint aspect of the experiment be that the expect and measure wavelength diagreed somewhat negate the precision of interferometry a a measurement tool,expert,bal,65,0.073338009,0.926661968
70,2ndINT_CYF541_Redacted,we investigate the spectrum of tungsten and mercury by use an interferometer to find the intensity of the light source this be do by arrange the different component of the interferometer to obtain an interference pattern of the light source and hence an amplify intensity we then use the fourier transform to find the spectrum of the source in wavelength space the temperature of tungsten be t 3199±446 k. we observe deviation from the expect black body radiation curve and hence analysis of the detector and beam splitter sensitivity be incorporate in order to obtain a more accurate curve furthermore for mercury we saw four main peak in the visible range which correspond to four discrete transition the spectrum however be very noisy and hence upon add a magnetic field we saw slight variation for the wavelength transition the study of spectrum have be a key element in develop our understand of different phenomenon range from the reaction occur in star to discreet atomic transition govern by quantum mechanical process 1 it be one of the major method use to observe matter in general context spectroscopy be the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation in the case of this experiment where we study the spectrum of different light source the main phenomenon govern the process be emission of photon due to atomic transition when atom move between high and low energy state they emit a photon hence in frequency or wavelength space the `` peak `` or the continuous spectrum fundamentally be due to these atomic transition of the source 2 in this experiment we study the spectrum of several light source and obtain the fourier transform of the source to observe it spectrum this be do by find the null point in the interferometer set-up which indicates the position of maximum intensity the two main aspect of the experiment study be the investigation of the black body radiation of tungsten 3 and the zeeman effect in mercury in the study of tungsten incorporate the effect of the detector and beam splitter be need in order to obtain the appropriate curve describe black body radiation in the case of mercury the same procedure be follow to obtain the spectrum to study the zeeman effect we add a magnet to our source we thus theoretically expect the energy level to split and hence see a split in the spectral line interference be the main phenomenon govern the process of this experiment the interferometer be set in a way to allow incoming beam from the light source to interfere constructively see method section the condition for constructive interference be where d be the separation between the interfere beam θ be the angle between them m an integer and λ be the wavelength of the light source the intensity of the wave be obtain use a photodiode and the record plot be an intensity versus distance plot the distance in this case represent the distance from the null point point where the intensity be a maximum in order to obtain the spectrum of the consider source we have to fast fourier transform the signal record by the inteferogram this be do by approximate the intensity signal in `` distance space `` to a set of discrete signal effectively this be give by where x k and x n be the amplitude in wavelength and distance space n be the number of sample consider and the exponential part represent the incoming transform wave in this experiment the incoming signal be gaussians which would in turn give gaussians a spectrum in wavelength space the expression look similar to the fourier series but the variable be different in this case 3 the spectrum of tungsten corresponds to a black body mainly because it emits electromagnetic radiation at all frequency therefore theoretically the intensity of radiation be give by planck 's law where i be the intensity a a constant h and c planck 's constant and the speed of light in vacuum 4 use this relation we can find the temperature of the tungsten law by the follow relation where t be the temperature and λ max be the peak wavelength of the spectrum and b be a constant of proportionality however the beam be affected by two main aspect both the beam splitter use and the detector have sensitivity towards wavelength we thus have two consider take those effect into account the follow plot show the sensitivity therefore in order to obtain the black body spectrum of the tungsten lamp source we should divide the output signal we observe by the above two contribution 5 the spectrum of mercury be different than the other lamp source use since the emission occur at specific wavelength rather than a range of wavelength in the visible region there be 4 wavelength correspond to the four emission at 405 nm 436 nm and 546 nm 579 nm thus theoretically we expect our spectrum to be comprise of 4 delta function centre around the above wavelength a simulation of the data provide a well visualisation of the above case an interest phenomenon occurs upon place the mercury in a magnetic field the energy level of the atomic spectrum of mercury split and hence the peak show in the spectrum split a well in theoretical context the magnetic field add can be thought of a a perturbation to the energy level of mercury atom the value of this perturbation be give by where b be the apply magnetic field µ b be the `` bohr magneton `` m j be the spin quantum number and g j be a constant related to the quantum number describe this system therefore the simulation above would be modify to include the energy level splitting a follow fig 3 simulation of the expect spectrum of mercury lamp upon apply a magnetic field a we can see in figure 3 the energy level of the mercury atom split far and thus we expect to see the emission of more wavelength 6 throughout this experiment the same experimental procedure be follow a schematic of the experimental set-up provide a well understand of the procedure follow the main aim behind the built set-up show in figure 4 be to allow the beam of light come from the desire light source to constructively interfere and hence give a point of maximum intensity light arrives from the source at the beam splitter where it be `` divide `` into two beam go to the two mirror which then interfere and the interfere wave arrives at the detector which measure the intensity of this signal when the distance between the two mirror be exactly the same the beam interfere constructively to give maximum intensity this be the position of the null point in practice find the null point manually be very difficult and thus mirror 2 have a motor which adjusts it position in other word it be enough to find the range of the null point and not the exact position once the range be obtain we can scan the motor and thus have a spectrum of the source at distance before and after the null point the next step be fourier transform the data in order to obtain the spectrum in frequency space for tungsten the same procedure be follow and in order to obtain a well curve describe the black body radiation spectrum we have to divide the output signal by the sensitivity of both the beam splitter and the detector the data-sheet of the beam splitter contain value of the different point we have to multiply and hence divide the output signal by that be relatively easy for the detector the data-sheet only contain a curve represent the value we therefore use mathmatica in order to extract the data by plot a grid which allows u to get the coordinate of the data point therefore take both contribution into account we obtain the spectrum of tungsten for mercury the additional step we conduct be place the lamp inside a magnet in order to observe the zeeman effect we can see from the above figure that upon add the contribution of the detector and beam splitter we get a black body spectrum the maximum wavelength of the spectrum be λ max 878 ± 26 nm and thus use equation 4 the temperature of the tungsten lamp use be t 3199±446 k. the plot with error bar be represent in b since the number of data point be relatively high and hence the plot would be messy and the difference between the curve with and without the sensitivity would not be clearer the error in our result be due to statistical error of run the motor several time and due to `` noise `` of our data more discussion in section v we obtain the spectrum of mercury with and without apply a magnetic field accord to equation 5 we except the peak to split into far different wavelength the result be summarise below a the spectrum of mercury when no magnetic field be apply b the spectrum of mercury when a magnetic field be apply fig 6 two plot show the difference between the spectrum of mercury when a magnetic field be apply figure 6 show the difference in the spectrum of mercury when a magnetic field be apply to the mercury lamp although we can see difference in the shape of the spectrum there be a lot of noise to differentiate between actual splitting of energy level or just random noise the value of the wavelength for the mercury spectrum be 411 ± 19 nm 447 ± 14 nm and 547 ± 12 nm 576 ± 25nm the value obtain along with their error lie within the range of the accepted theoretical value and value obtain by simulation which be 405 nm 436 nm and 546 nm 579 nm concern error the source of error be the same a the one use for tungsten the source of error be statistical due to measure several number of data set and noise in our experiment see appendix for plot with error bar since it make visualise the difference harder for the first part of the experiment the main experimental result be calculate the temperature of tungsten lamp the value obtain be t 3199 ± 446 k. this value along with it error lie within the accepted value of the temperature which be t 2796 k 7 accord to the lamp data-sheet we can see that the expect black body spectrum of tungsten be not quite obtain when directly plot the intensity in the experiment this be mainly due to the way the equipment use receives the incoming light upon find the sensitivity of the beam splitter use in the set-up and the detector we can see that the spectrum be improve and look more like a black body in particular we can see that after the peak the spectrum decay in a way that corresponds to the exponential part show in equation 3 however we can also see that there be still slight difference between the spectrum obtain and the theoretical spectrum of a black body the difference observe can be explain by several factor the way the sensitive be multiply possibly explains these difference a function be not provide for the sensitivity of the detector and therefore numerical method be use to obtain the data point and thus manually multiply the experimental point with these sensitivity the drawback of the method use be that only a limited number of data point be found compare to the large data set and therefore the variation show be for few data point than the one use in the experiment see appendix a for more detail on the method use to extract the point concern the error of the experiment two main source of error be identify the first source of error be the noise present in the experiment around the null point relatively far from the null point we except to see destructive interference thus the small value of intensity be assume to be noise and hence be take into account into the error calculation furthermore a second source of error be statistical to the way data-sets be take in order to improve the accuracy of our result we take 4 or 5 independent data set of every light source therefore a standard deviation and a mean be obtain for individual point which thus introduce a statistical error for the second part of the experiment the wavelength of the mercury spectrum be 411 ± 19 nm 447 ± 14 nm and 547 ± 12 nm 576 ± 25nm the obtain value along with their error lie within the range of the know value the main thing to notice about the spectrum be the relatively low resolution of the measurement this in turn make it hard to actually distinguish between peak and noise in other word although the above measure value be the high peak we can clearly see that there be several other peak this therefore also implies that see actual clear difference when apply the magnetic field be hard a well we can see slight difference in the two plot in figure 6 in particular we can see more peak in the plot show the magnetic field however extract data and numerical difference be relatively difficult to obtain due to the low resolution present several step can be follow in the future to improve the resolution of the plot the major one would be to investigate the behaviour of the motor in detail since it be probably the main factor responsible for the resolution in particular a plot of the distance cover by the motor a a function of time can be consider to see if the motor move in the expect way furthermore the fast fourier transform can be modify to see if this affect the resolution we try however to modify this by use a different method to what be use for the other spectrum the result be not very different from the one obtain and hence modify the way of the fourier transform be not likely to affect the resolution a lot the source of error in the second part of the experiment be calculate in the same way a the tungsten lamp for both part although the calculate quantity be within the range of the expect value there be a possibility of the existence of systematic error the equipment and the detector be very sensitive to any change of distance or light intensity and hence external source of error might have be present in the experiment in order to reduce these source we try to make sure before start to take measurement that the distance be the same and that the lid cover the apparatus be properly on to avoid vary the light intensity in this experiment two main experimental result be obtain the temperature of a tungsten lamp source be calculate to be t 3199 ± 446 k. this result be obtain by take into account the both the detector and beam splitter sensitivity when measure the intensity of the tungsten lamp source in the second part of the experiment we obtain peak wavelength of mercury at 411 ± 19 nm 447 ± 14 nm and 547 ± 12 nm 576 ± 25nm upon introduce the magnetic field we expect accord to the zeeman effect to see energy level splitting and hence several other peak the major drawback however be that the resolution of our spectrum be low and hence differentiate between peak or general noise be relatively difficult several possible extension be interest to far investigate in this experiment for the first part improve the numerical method use to take into account the sensitivity of the detector and beam splitter would provide to be useful to well improve the black body spectrum of tungsten for the second part the major extension would be to investigate the resolution of the interferograms in order to improve the spectrum of the mercury lamp this in turn would provide an improve resolution when compare the data with the magnetic field apply to the mercury lamp in brief the method use to extract the point consists of plot the graph on mathmatica and then plot small grid line which enable u to find the coordinate of the point an example below provide a visualisation of how the method work thus after find the point a scalar multiplication be do to the experimental data point to obtain a new fit the plot below show the mercury spectrum with error bard the plot be not place in the result section since the resolution of the mercury spectrum be low and the error bard make the plot more

1,2ndINT_GYI981_Redacted,in this experiment a series of light spectl 3 from various light source be produce with use of a mic.helson intel'feromete1• the light source use we1•e a white lead blue lead and a 2796k tungsten lamp additionally green and yellow filtel 's we1•e use in conjunction with the tungsten lamp to obse1-ve the effect they have on the tungsten spectrum these spectrum be described quantitatively by several value wavelength coherence length and spectral width with use of these value in addition to the genel'31 shape of the spectrum the light source can be characterise and compa1•ed to the theory all spectl 3 produce we1•e of the same shape a their theoretical counterpart and most disc1•epandes could be account for by the 1•esponse function of the detector use the white lead have the b1•oadest spectl•al width of 137.9nm and thus also the large coherence length whic.h be a expect a white light contains all frequency of light the colour light source have narrower spectl•a and the light filter be show to shift and narrow the specn•a in accordance with their expect bandpass region t he aim of this experiment be to measure and characterise light spectrum from various light source through find their mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width and see if these result coincide with the theory the physical aim be to construct and operate a michelson interferometer in order to record interferograms of various light source these interferograms can then be use to obtain the various spectrum of the light source a far goal be to explore how different light filter would affect the light spectnun produce to do this a simple michelson interferometer be built and by emit the light source onto the interferometer and measure the light intensity over a few millimetre in distance an interferogram be produce to produce the spectrum the interferogram be fourier transform and then through fitting a gaussian the characteristic value previously mention can be calculate the michelson interferometer be a collllllon configuration for an optical interferometer and have many u from study the atmosphere measure the diameter of star test optical component and be even use in the detection of gravitational wave pl it relies on the use of a beam splitter which split the incident light from the source into two separate beam and down different path these beam be then reflect and re combine accord to the superposition principal at the beam splitter and an interference pattem be measure at the detector the superposition principle be a fundamental and very important idea with many application in physic and engineering though principle such a this be very well understood and have be for a long period of time it be always important to revisit these idea a it help develop our understand of them interferometry and optic will always be relevant and essential area of physic -not only be the fundamental of these branch apply in everyday life such a in photography and medicine but they be also crucial in the study of quantum mechanic astronomy and more this experiment relies on the use of a michelson interferometer the basis of this interferometer be that the light from the source be emit onto a beam splitter in this case a half-silvered mirrnr which can send the light dm v11 two possible path one of the beam will be reflect by 90 degree and one will be transmit a see in figure 1 below it be important to note that when light hit the beam-splitter and be reflect on the side of the dielectric plate the light will undergo a phase shift of n radian the reflect beam travel along arm a to the first rnirtor m 1 and be reflect back towards the beam splitter likewise the transmit beam travel along aim b to the mirror m2 the two wave then recombine once they reach the beam splitter where their amplitude will combine in accordance with the superposition prir1ciple some of this light will be transmit in the dire ction of the source and some will travel towards the detector sir1ce the light travel to the detector be a supe1position of two wave an interference pattem will be observe at the detector the nature of which be detennir1ed by the path difference and relative phase of the two wave due to the phase shift that the wave that travel along arm b experience if the path difference of the two wave be zero or integer multiple of wavelength i.e the distance of each min-or from the beam splitter be the same the wave be in fact out of phase and have a phase difference of 7c radian this mean the wave will undergo complete destructive interference and a dark fringe will be see meanwhile if there be a path difference of multiple half wavelength they will ultimately be in phase when they reach the detector and constmctive interference will occur so a bright fringe be see the path difference of the two wave be dependent on the difference in arm length for the two 1nitrnrs figure 2 show a simplify diagram of the michelson interferometer assume the 1nittors be perfectly pe1pendicular when observe from the position of the detector see figure 1 the light simply appear to be reflect from two min-ors in line w ith each other with a distance t between them which be equal to the difference in aim length use simple trigonometiy it be easy to see that the light beam reflect off the second miirnr m2 travel an exti•a distance equal to 2tcos 0 before reach the observer a aforementioned constructive interference occurs at half integer wavelength in a michelson interferometer hence for constmctive ii1terference where a. be the wavelength and m be the order of inte1ference which be an integer there be two type of visible fringe that may be observe haidii1ger and fizeau haidinger frii1ges ai•e cfrculai• whereas fizeau fringe fonn sti•aight line 1 2 1. haidinger frii1ges be produce when the two 1nittors appeai• to be perfectly pai•allel a in figure 2 such that the angle at which the light be incident and reflect from the two 1nittors be the same and hence there be cylii1drical symmetiy this symmetly be disturbed when one of the lllllrnrs be tilt and the fringe pattem tends to fonn more of a stl'aight line pattem to understand the spectrn of different light source it be necessaiy to understand how each light source work in this experiment the light source use be a white lead a blue lead and a white tungsten source ffrstly lead create light by electroluminescence electroluminescence be what occurs when an elect1•ic cun-ent or field be pas through a semiconductor material which then emits light the lead contains two layer of material which have be doped such that one layer have an excess of electi•ons and the second an excess of positive electron hole fonning a p-n junction this junction only allows electron to flow from the positive layer to the negative a the electi•on move into the electi•on hole a photon be release because the energy level of the positive hole be low the difference in energy between the layer be call the bandgap and be specific to each combination of material therefore the frequency of light emit and hence the colour of lead be detennined by the material use in the p-n junction and be only over a short range of wavelength to create a white lead you coat a blue lead with phosphor these phosphor absorb the light and ai•e then reemitted at a different large wavelength of a different colour thus by combii1ing a blue lead with a mixture of different phosphor a combination of different wavelength of light be emit produce white light 1 3 1. the process through which a tungsten lamp emits light be know a incandescence the emission of light be a result of a tungsten filament be heat to high temperature when a c1utent pas through it this be thermal radiation and thus a tungsten lamp can be approximate to a blackbody 1 5 1. a theoretical blackbody spectmm can be found usii1g p lanck s law 2hv 3 1 where b be the spectral radiance density h be planck 's constant v be the frequency of radiation c be the speed of light k the boltzmann constant and t the temperatme of the blackbody 1 6 1. the spectral shape of the emission spectrum from these light source be approximately a gaussian the normal distribution of a gaussian have the fom1 u ... fzii where µ be the mean value and u be the standard deviation so through fitting a gaussian to a spectrnm the mean/central wavelength can be found precisely fwthennore the spectral width be equal to the full width at half maximwn fwhm of the gaussian the fwhm and thus the spectral width can be fou11d from the follow equation 21 the spectral width be a measure of the range of frequency or wavelength emit by the light source use this value in conjunction with the mean wavelength the coherence length l of the source can be found l ~2 x 5 where a. be the mean wavelength and til be the spectral width 8 1. the coherence length be the distance over which a light wave remains a specific degree of coherence when the path difference of interfere wave be within the coherence length the interference pattem be strong beyond this the signal becomes poor an interferogram be a record of the signal across an interference pattem a spectnun of light be just a fourier transfo1m of the interferogram go from the temporal domain to the spectral frequency domain due to the fact the spectmm be a gaussian the interferogram will also be in the f01m of a gaussian 2 1. an important feature of this be that the nairnwer the spectral width of the gaussian the wider the interferogram hence the michelson interferometer can be use a a spectrometer a will be discus more in the method ill. me1hod the interferometer be built in agreement with the set up show in figure 1 specifically with a silicon detector the detector be attach to a computer which sainpled the data at a rate of 50hz the first mitrnr ml be place on a motorise stage so that the interference pattem could be scan over a range of path difference the speed at which the stage move to ai1y position could be specify the interferometer must be almost perfectly align to get the con-ect interference pattems to ensw•e this the two miffors must be at the exact same distance from the beam splitter and all equipment must be level and parallel with the optical bench the two 1nitrors be place at approximately the same distance from the beam splitter to guarantee the distance be exactly equal a monochromatic laser be use this produce two laser spot one from ea.eh miffor which be then reflect onto a surface some distance away such that they be small and in do so increase the precision of the alignment the miffors be adjust tmtil the two spot be dfrectly on top of ea.eh other to ensure that the 1nitrors be parallel a lens be insert so that the interference pattem could be see and the mi1rnr be tilt tmtil haidinger fringe be observe before takit1g any data it be necessary to find the null point the null point of the interferometer be when the aim length a1•e equal so the path difference of the two light wave be zero i.e t=o arou11d the null point the it1te1ference pattem of light will be most prominent this be because the space of tbe frit1ges be proportional to the wavelength of light so the fringe will only coincide near the region where the path difference be zero 9 1. once the null point be fotmd these bright and dark fringe can be record to give an interferogram to find the null point ml be move in very slowly in ve1y small increment and the fringe pattem observe refening to equation one a the null point be approach t decrease and thus the angle of the reflect light get large so fringe appear to move in towards the centre of the cfrcle the null point be at the position where the dfrection of movement of the fringe revers once this position be roughly fow1d the reduce rai1ge be scan over use a white lead source at the null point this will produce a large dark frit1ge but just arow1d it a distit1ctive interference pattem of a few different colour fringe be see a the many wavelength withit1 white light have be sepai•ated to find the exact position it be ne cessaiy to use the white lead interferogram create a simulation of this exact setup it be possible to find the shape of the interferogram arntmd the null point so once this shape of it1terferogram have be fotmd it be conclude that the coitect length have be en scan over and the null point lie it1 the position of the centre of the interferogram once the null poit1t be found it be possible to find light spectrum of various light source from thefr interferograms repeat the scan process that be carry out for the white lead interferograms of a blue lead and white tungsten lamp also obtain the interference pattems be scan over small distance at slow speed such that many data point be take to extract the light spectrum from the interferogram a fast fourier transform fft be pe1fo1med on the data within python this rely upon the fact that there be equal space between each data point in the interferogram once the specflum be found it be possible to fit a gaussian to the transfonned data use an inbuilt function on python which give the standard deviation and the value of the mean wavelength to investigate how light filter affected the light spectrum the same process be can-ied out but with two different filter fit inside the tungsten lamp yellow and green firstly from the interferogram produce from tlte white lead show in figure 7 it be possible to find the null point compare this to the simulated interferogram in figure 6 it be of a similar shape and symmetly just with more fringe the cenfl•e of this graph and hence the position of the null point of the interferometer lie at -2.872±0.0005mm a gaussian be fit to each of the peak in the spectrum the first one centi•ed at 450nm coll'esponds to the light from the blue lead and the second one centre at 585nm coll'esponds to the mixture of wavelength emit from the phosphor compare this to the theoretical spectrum in figure 3 the position of the spectrum be accurate however the relative intensity of the peak be unexpected this however be a direct result of the responsivity of the silicon detector this be it effectiveness at produce an electi•ic signal at different wavelength this varies with each detector but in general be high for large wavelength a show in figure 9 when take this into account the peak at 450nm would in fact be of a high intensity than the one at 585run which would match with the tlteory • 1000 1100 fig 9. typical response function of a silicon detector iioj_ when find the spectral length of the white light only the peak at 585nm be consider since tltis contain a large number of wavelength and be more representative of a white light source the standard deviation of this gaussian be 59run so from 4 the specfl•al width be 137.srun use this in 5 in conjw1ction with tlte mean wavelength the value for the coherence length come out a 0.0039mm -by look a t the distance the interferogram span in figure 7 this value seem quite accurate next the interference of a blue lead be measure a this only contains one colour of light it emits light over a small range of frequency so it be expect that the spectral width of this source will be nall'ower than that of the white lead -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this gaussian fit to this spectrum be centre at 4 7 6run which be within the range of wavelength for blue light the shape of this spectrum match that of the blue lead peak show in figure 3. the standard deviation of the gaussian be equal to 13run and thus the spectra.i width be 30.4nm this be much less than that of the white lead which be consistent witlt the theo1y the coherence lengtlt be found to be 0.0050mm again this be more than that of the white lead and be thus consistent with the tlteory a for a nairnwer spectral width the broader the interferogram produce a mention in the theory section the spectrum for the tungsten lamp be more consistent with that of a blackbody than a gaussian it be immediately clear that this do not give the expect result this can be explain through consideration of the response function show in figure 9 -the responsivity of the detector rapidly cut off around the 1000nm mark which con-esponds to where the spectrum cut off so realistically the spectnun do continue past 1000nm just the detector do not respond to the signal secondly from figure 4 you would expect the spectrum to be more jagged -this could simply be due to the fact that not enough data point be measure so the resolution be not good enough to pick up the rise and fall in the spectrum a a gaussian be not fit to the spectrnm the value for wavelength and coherence length must be read off the above graph the spectrum suggests that the mean wavelength be at approximately 800mn and the width of the interferogram and hence the coherence length be approximately 0.005mm by rean-anging 5 the spectral width come at to be 85mn a light filter be a piece of material which absorbs some frequency of light but allows others to pa through essentially passing through just one specific colour the range of frequency it do transmit be it bandwidth in this experiment a yellow and a green filter be use with the tungsten lamp a show in figure 13 when the green filter be use the tungsten spectmm be spectrum be shift such that it be centre at 555nm which be within the range of green light ~520-560nm furthennore it be much na1tower than the original tungsten spectnun with cj 8nm and the spectral width equal to 18.7mn this be what you would expect a the light pas through the filter with few frequency the coherence length be 0.026mm -a much large coherence length for a much nan-ow spectrnm similarly for the yellow filter the spectnun be shift to 590mn with an equal standard deviation and thus spectral width a the green filter yellow light be within the of ~560-5 90mn so this be what you would expect from the theo1y also since the spectral width of this spectrnm be equal to that of the green filter it can be conclude that the size of the bandwidth of the two filter be the same again this give a large value for the coherence length l=0.029mm i 1 000 the main source of e1tor in this experiment come from the fact the fourier transfo1m require that the distance between each sample be equal when in fact when look at the raw data for the position of the stage this be not the case a lot of the time when transfonning to the spectrnl wavelength domain this could lead to a shift in the position of the spectmm potentially make it wider in some part and na1tower in others this would have an effect on the mean value of the wavelength and the spectral width and thus also the coherence length furthennore potential misalignment of the apparatus throughout the experiment could affect the interference pattern and interferogram record which would also adjust the shape of the spectrum produce a silicon detector typically have a tolerance of around 5 so there be some e1tor in the value show for the intensity however since only the relative intensity be of interest and this will have the same effect on all the sample this do not directly affect the result and can be take into account within the response function the aim of this experiment be to use a michelson interferometer a a fourier transform spectrometer in order to obtain and compare spectrum of different light source the interferometer be successful in obtain fairly accurate spectrum for each source and the characteristic of each spectrum i.e mean wavelength and spectral width varied in agreement with the theory the second aspect of this experiment be to show how light filter change the shape of the light spectrum and how the bandwidth of the filter change the spectral width both the blue and yellow filter create a large decrease in the spectral width of the tungsten spectrum and shift the peak accordingly to the wavelength that align with their colour a an improvement more sample should be take over the distance of the interferogram a this will in turn produce a spectrum of great resolution furthermore a response function of the detector should be make which considers before the responsivity and tolerance of the detector such that the spectrum could be adjust to give a more accurate view of the relative intensity to gain a great understand of the error in the calculation some analysis could be carry out to see how unequal space would affect the fft and consequently the spectral shape,deep,bal,75,0.08864972,0.91135031
21,2ndINT_FVA673_Redacted,the interferograms and wavelength distribution of various light source be study use a michelson interferometer and fourier analysis we first set up and tune the interferometer to find the null point use a white lead use the sensitivity-wavelength plot of the detector we be able to approximate the measure curve to a 10th degree polynomial and correct the wavelength distribution of various light source although this curve be only specify between 400-1100 nm the white lead be deduce to be a blue lead with a phosphor coat base on it wavelength distribution but disagreement between the nature of the lead measure and that specify by the manafacturer suggests the sensitivity curve be erroneous the temperature of a tungsten lamp be study by extract the wavelength with maximum spectral radiance and use wien 's law to find the correspond temperature the best available temperature that could be calculate be found to be 2701k attribute the error to the erroneous sensitivity curve and also possibly to impurity in the lamp absorb high wavelength i nterference be a phenomenon in which two wave superimpose to give an interference pattern wherein the result amplitude can be great lesser or equal to the amplitude of the original light wave the image produce be call interferograms the fact that light show an interference pattern be direct proof of the wave nature of light interferometer be device in which one can form interferograms of light source to study the property of the light source the michelson interferometer be one such interferometer wherein a light beam be split into two different perpendicular ray and their path difference can be varied before interference to produce interferograms the michelson interferometer become famous when it be use in the michelson-morley experiment to prove that space be not fill with an aether but rather spaace be empty and light could propagate in vacuum fourier transform spectroscopy be use to analyse the interferograms of various light source this experiment involves the set up of a michelson interferometer search for the null point use a light source that have a narrow enough spatial coherence and analyse the interferograms of various light source to study their wavelength distribution the interferogram be convert to a wavelength distribution use the fast fourier transform package in python issue with circular symmetry have be discus interferometry theory and various result have be discus in far section the mathematical formalism of fourier theory can be apply to investigate the wavelength distribution of the light source base on the intensity spectrum measure use the michelson interferometer it can be show that the fourier transform of a gaussian function be another gaussian function with the spread in their respective space be inversely proportional 1 planck 's law describes the spectral radiance per unit wavelength of a black body a a function of it wavelength and temperature the expression be give by 2 use planck 's law one can relate the wavelength with the maximum spectral radiance to the temperature of the blackbody this relation be approximately give by 2 a tungsten lamp can very accurately model to be a blackbody because it luminescence come from a tungsten coil be heat to a very high temperature and emit visible light hence the temperature of the tungsten lamp can be deduce by inspection of it wavelength distribution there be two type of fringe in an interference pattern haidinger fringe and fizeau fringe haidinger fringe be circular fringe that occur when the mirror be not at equal distance from the beam splitter they be circular because the mirror be exactly perpendicular and the interference have circular symmetry fizeau fringe be slightly more distort fringe that occur because the mirror be not quite perpendicular lead to a loss in circular symmetry typically the interference pattern be a combination of the two type of fringe in the case of haidinger fringe wee can relate the mth bright fringe to it angular distance by the equation 3 where t be be the relative difference of the distance of the mirror from the beam splitter and theta be the angular distance of the mth bright fringe from the center hence we see that for t=0 null point the only solution for m be m=0 hence at the null point we should observe a continuous bright spot and no fringe because the path difference be 0 at all point detail on set up to locate the null point have be discus in the next section haidinger fringe fizeau fringe and a continuous distribution have be displayed below 4 in this experiment we have make the use of a michelson interferometer because it be relatively easy to setup and it be very convenient in it ability to introduce phase difference between wave simply by move one of the mirror a michelson interferometer consists of two mirror m1 and m2 place perpendicular to each other face a beam splitter at an of angle 45°to both the mirror the beam splitter be glass that be partially silver on one side which cause some part of the light to reflect and some part of it to pa through unimpeded the mirror m2 can have it angle tilt to ensure that the mirror be perpendicular and the mirror m1 be fix on a stage with a motor that can alter it distance from the beam splitter and this distance can be change until the ideal fringe pattern be observe the null point corresponds to the point at which m1 and m2 be exactly the same distance from the mirror m1 be then move by various distance to get a distance v intensity plot for our interferogram the detector be a fix photodiode and can detect wavelength between 400 to 1100 nm 5 the setup be illustrate in fig 4. the goal of set up the interferometer be to get haidinger fringe a close to the detector a possible if the mirror be exactly perpendicular to each other we would expect circular symmetry in our fringe but it be not realistically possible to get them exactly perpendicular to each other so will observe fizeau fringe a well the mirror be first place perpendicular to each other and then the beam splitter be place at an appropriate location such that we get circular fringe on a screen use a green laser to do this we rotate the beamsplitter and tilt m2 to get the best possible position the detector be then place a close to the center of the circular fringe a possible the maximum intensity be locate at the null point due to the fact that the green laser have a low wavelength distribution the interference pattern will have a high spatial distribution hence it be difficult to deduce the null point we simply use the green laser to get a range in which the null point could be locate we use a white lead which have a large wavelength distribution to find the exact null point from equation 4 we know the haidinger fringe will move inward a we move toward the null point and outward a we move away if t decrease θ decrease ie the same fringe will be at a small angular distance and appear to move inward a you reduce t. equivalently it will appear to move outward if t increase if the fringe switch from move inward to outward we know that we have cross the null point we can then scan over that small range with the white light to find the exact null point due to very high spatial coherence of white light it be use to find the null point the michelson interferometer be now a very accurate device to study the wavelength distribution of various source although it should be note that the white light be not a collimate beam hence cause difference in intensity a you move the mirror this problem be somewhat well by passing the white light through a lens to collimate it the mirror be then move and the correspond intensity be measure to get the require interferograms the detector in use detects wavelength only between 400-1100 nm with a great than 10 sensitivity it be more sensitive to some wavelength than others the sensitivity against wavelength curve have be displayed below 5 fig 5 sensitivity of the detector a a function of wavelength 5 use an online digitiser several hundred point be extract from the curve a 10th order polynomial be then fit to those data point use the polyfit function in python to define a sensitivity funciton in term of wavelength the amplitude value in the measure data be then divide by their correspond sensitivity value to give the true wavelength distribution note that the sensitivity data be only define between 400-1100 nm so we have not study wavelength outside that range the 10th order polynomial function have be plot below i chose order 10 because the accuracy reduce if an order great or lesser than 10 be chosen the polynomial be give by s − 7.84 × 10 − 24 λ 10 6.13×10 −20 λ 9 − 2.12×10 −16 λ 8 4.25×10 −13 λ 7 − 5.51×10 −10 λ 6 4.81×10 −7 λ 5 − 2.86×10 −4 λ 4 1.15 × 10 −1 λ 3 − 2.98 × 10 1 λ 2 4.51 × 10 3 λ − 3.02 × 10 5 fig 6 10th order polynomial that be model to be the measure sensitivity curve the white lead be use to find the null point because of it high spatial coherence the interference pattern where the null point be clearly visible have be displayed below one way to produce a white lead be to have a blue lead with a phosphor coat some of the blue photon be convert to yellow photon by the phosphor coat this combination of blue and yellow light appear white to our eye 6 we know that this be a blue lead coat with phosphor because upon inspection of fig 8 we see two peak at approximately 450 nm and 590 nm these correspond to blue-violet and yellow light respectively it be obvious that the spread in distribution come from a yellow phosphor coat because of the large spectral width around 590 nm the lead be a warm white lead for it relatively large peak at yellow than blue however information from the manafacturer say that the lead be meant to be a cold white lead rather than a warm white lead 7 which mean that we 'd expect a high peak at blue this suggests that the sensitivity curve be possibly erroneous and do not correctly account for the detector 's sensitivity to various wavelength this hypothesis be far support in the study of the tungsten lamp in the next subsection the interferogram of the tungsten source have be plot it be also a white light hence we expect large spatial coherence the tungsten source be investigate due to the fact that it behaves like a blackbody the amplitude measure rise very sharply at value close to 1100 nm this be possibly erroneous because it lead to a very strong deviation from planck 's law so for the scope of tungsten we will deduce it temperature use the uncorrected data the wavelength correspond to the high spectral density from the uncorrected data be found to be 897.71 nm then use equation 3 the temperature of the tungsten lamp be calculate to be 3228k this be well below tungsten 's melt point of 3695k but we know that that tungsten lamp have a more typical temperature in the range of 2000-3000k 8 to get to the bottom of the source of error we will investigate the temperature correspond to the correct wavelength distribution the wavelength with the large spectral radiance in the correct distribution be measure to be 1073.1 nm from equation 3 this corresponds to a temperature of 2701k this be a more likely temperature of the tungsten lamp hence we can deduce that the odd behaviour of the wavelength distribution might not be due to the sensitivity-wavelength curve of the detector be erroneous but rather the error be intrinsic to the tungsten lamp itself this could possibly be because of impurity or the gas that fill the lamp that be absorb high wavelength give the fickle nature of the source of error the calculate temperature 2701k be likely not a good representation of the behaviour of the tungsten lamp we also see that a large part of the energy produce by the tungsten lamp be emit in the infrared region which be not visible which mean that the usage of tungsten lamp lead to a large wastage of energy we have successfully use fourier transform spectroscopy to analyse the interferograms of a white lead and a tungsten lamp which be nearly continuous white light source a michelson interferometer be setup to generate these interferograms follow which the fast fourier transform package in python be use to generate the wavelength distribution from the interferograms the white lead have a nearly continuous distribution with two local wavelength peak correspond to 450 nm and 590 nm this implies that the white lead be indeed a blue lead with a phosphor coat to generate blue and yellow photon which when combine appear white to the human eye the tungsten lamp be approximate to a black body but due to issue that be likely intrinsic to the lamp or because of the abrupt decrease in sensitivity near 1100 nm the temperature of the lamp could not be deduce for sure but base on prior knowledge of likely temperature of a tungsten lamp the peak wavelength of 1073.1 nm be the best possible value we have obtain from the correct wavelength distribution which corresponds to a temperature of 2701 k. the inaccuracy of the wavelength distribution around the infrared region make it impossible to accurately quantify property of the lamp like it efficiency although we see that most of it energy be in the infrared this experiment could be improve if fourier spectroscopy could be conduct in the infrared region also it be likely that the sensitivity curve be incorrect so an update and correct sensitivity curve would be helpful in obtain well and more trustworthy result some detector also give relatively noisy data for equivalent data set this could possibly have lead to some imperfect deduction of peak wavelenghts and hence offset result,superficial,bal,70,0.089778431,0.910221577
52,2ndINT_YMJ516_Redacted,he application of device which emit radiation be almost a numerous a the device themselves while light-emitting diode which saw their first practical production in 1962 1 be originally only able to produce emission in the infra-red region they have since be design to emit light across the visible spectrum for use in aviation light automotive headlamp and digital display in fact in 2014 a nobel prize be award to nakamura et al for their work in the 1990 's on the production of the first blue lead 2 lamp contain tungsten or mercury have be use for domestic light but many have be discontinue after the discovery of their high uv emission in order to reliably design and manufacture these device it be important to be able to characterize them in term of the spectrum they emit the intensity of their emission and their operating temperature one technique for characterize these source be interferometry by observe the behaviour of interfere electromagnetic wave it be possible to learn about the source itself the medium that the wave be travel through and also the equipment use to detect it the result of interferometry be call an interferogram and from the fourier analysis of these we can find the emission spectrum of source an example of an interferometer be use in modern physic be the ligo experiment in america where use an interferometer with 4 km long arm the first detection of gravitational wave be make by observe the slight fluctuation of the interference pattern cause by a change in the length of the interferometer arm ten time small than the size of the proton 3 evidence by this example interferometry be a staple in experimental physic and it be by this method that this experiment analyse the property of a range of optical source the lead 's study in this experiment be base on semiconductor diode these emit light by provide enough energy for electron to cross the gap between the valence and conduction band and recombine with hole result in photoemission the reason that lead 's have a finite bandwidth be that the band gap be not the same distance everywhere produce a spectrum of possible energy for emit photon the impurity in the semiconductor material be such that the spectrum of lead 's can be approximate by a gaussian distribution an incandescent tungsten filament lamp produce white light from a thin wire carry a high current the filament becomes hot with many device have operating temperature of around 3000 k 4 tungsten filament lamp can be approximate to blackbody and so their spectrum can be expect to follow planck 's law where 𝐸 𝜆 be the energy emit per unit volume of a cavity in the blackbody λ be the wavelength emit and t be the temperature of the source 5 for a blackbody of temperature t the peak wavelength λmax can be found use wien 's displacement law 2 where b be the `` wien 's displacement constant `` 6 this can be derive from planck 's law 1 numerically use newton 's method while a range of `` monochrome `` lead 's can be produce by vary the semiconducting material use to produce a white lead a common method involves coat a blue lead in a phosphor a popular choice for this be ce 3+ yag which emits a broad bandwidth of yellow light 7 the combination of the narrower blue band and the wider yellow band produce an overall white light by have those photon emit by the characterisation of optical source by method of interferometry and fourier analysis t lead which do n't pa through the coat excite the phosphor electron result in yellow emission this phosphor band can also be approximate to a gaussian two source of the same wavelength will interfere when superpose on the same position with bright concentric circular fringe form at the point where the path difference between the two source be an integer number of wavelength for two source of different wavelength fringe can still form but the point at which they do be dependent on the difference between the two wavelength for example the separation t where the first maximum be found for source of wavelength λ1 and λ2 must satisfy the follow condition a more source be add the point where constructive interference form ring become more complicate to calculate however the one point where fringe can always be found be the point where the separation be zero this be know a the null point and be where due to the change in the degree of interference the amplitude of the resultant waveform be most sensitive change in separation this be a sensible place to scan to form an interferogram of a source contain multiple wavelength such a a blackbody the process of the experiment involve analyse the source through spectroscopy by first record the signal produce by the source a they interfere at the null point and then use fourier analysis to characterise the source in term of their emission spectrum the michelson interferometer use be assemble a described by figure 1. from there the difference in the path of the beam d1 -d2 determines the type of interference observe at the detector the interferometer be assemble such that d1 ≈ d2 so that the detector be near the null point then by scan short distance between every millimetre the rough position of the null point be found to find the null point a green laser of wavelength 532 nm be use a it form bright fringe which could be use to as whether the mobile mirror be move towards or away from the null point if the mirror be approach the null point the concentric fringe would appear to collapse inwards if the mirror be recede from the null point the fringe would appear to expand outwards with the null point locate the green laser be replace with a blue lead a white lead and then a collimate tungsten lamp for each of the source the mobile mirror be programmed to scan across the null point and the signal detect be record on a computer the data record by the detector be unpacked in a python module and a 2d plot library be use to produce interferograms of each of the source use a fast fourier transform package the data be employ to produce the wavelength domain representation of the signal it be expect that the step size between data point should be 1 -2 nm to verify this we form a histogram of the distance between adjacent data point the result of this be described by figure 2. we found that there be distribution of step size centre about -1 nm this value be non-zero because the mobile mirror have a speed and be negative because the mirror be move from right to left in this scan we take the mean of step size in the second and third quartile to omit those near the begin and end because at these point we found the motion of the mobile mirror be stutter this mean be use to plot the theoretical fit for the source spectrum since the blue lead be effectively monochromatic we would expect the interferogram of it signal to display a singlet wave packet this be what be found and the fourier transform of the data be displayed in figure 3. use the gaussian the lead be estimate to have a peak wavelength of 473.84 ± 0.48 nm with the error arise from the covariance matrix of the gaussian fit this place the blue lead in the blue region of the visible spectrum 9 a expect the fwhm of the gaussian be calculate to estimate the bandwidth of the blue lead to be 30.48 ± 1.11 𝑛𝑚 the white lead be expect to have two peak in it wavelength space representation one peak in the blue region of the visible spectrum and a second peak in the yellow region figure 4 show the wavelength spectrum of the white lead the profile of the fit in figure 4 be that of the sum of two gaussians indicate two main emission band the first band be found to have a peak wavelength of 460.83 ± 1.92 𝑛𝑚 and a bandwidth of 34.86 ± 4.18 𝑛𝑚 these value be like those of the blue lead which be encourage a we know the white lead contains one of these the second band be found to have a peak wavelength of 585.78 ± 2.39 𝑛𝑚 which be in the yellow region of the visible spectrum and a bandwidth of 151.88 ± 6.06 𝑛𝑚 this be much wider than the blue peak which indicates that there be a wide range of allow transition in the yellow region of the visible spectrum possibly due to there be multiple layer of slightly different phosphor coat the similarity in the amplitude of these two peak be what give the lead it clean white colour have one of the peak be significantly great than the other the lead would have appear to be a cooler or warmer white figure 5 show the simulation of a white light source the profile of the interferogram in figure 6 closely follow the prediction make by the simulation in figure 5. here the tungsten lamp appear to behave a expect the tungsten lamp be found to operate at a temperature of 2796 k 10 and be expect to behave a a blackbody of this characteristic temperature for the tungsten lamp a model utilise planck 's law 1 be use to attempt a fit curve to the profile of the data the result of this be found in figure 7. here the tungsten lamp be discover to not behave a expect base on the know operating temperature of the tungsten we would expect a wavelength space representation which peak later and with a longer tail than that we see in figure 7. if we omit the tail of the profile of the experimental data and assume the lamp be act a a blackbody we find use wien 's displacement law 2 that the lamp have an operating temperature of 3625 k. this be far above the know operating temperature it be possible that a tungsten lamp be in fact much different than a blackbody however there be much evidence external to this experiment that suggests this be n't the case with this rule out the practical conclusion be that the detector have a finite range of wavelength over which it can reliably detect a signal this detection drop of rapidly for wavelength great than 800 nm for this reason it be not sensible to characterise the tungsten source use this apparatus this experiment use a michelson interferometer and fourier analysis technique to characterise a blue lead and a white lead an attempt be make to characterise a tungsten lamp but it be conclude that a reliable estimate of it property could not be make with our experimental apparatus the property of the characterise source be described in table 1,superficial,the,65,0.103372492,0.896627545

superimpose give an interference pattern which give information about the difference in the path the michelson interferometer be a common interferometer set up from the experiment conduct by michelson and morley which be one of the early piece of evidence for the theory of special relativity it consists of a partially silver mirror which split a light source into two beam which travel to two plane mirror the beam then subsequently reflect to meet at a detector a see in figure 2 the aim of this experiment be to investigate the interference pattern of different light source use the michelson interferometer to find the spectral width of the light source a well a this wiens displacement law can be use to find a good approximation to the temperature of a filament in a light these technique be often use astronomy in observe starsusing their light to find their temperature light source be make up of a series of wavelength of light this be due to the very nature of the emission of light from a light source correspond to an energy change in an atom molecule or ion a useful approximation for the distribution of the frequency of the light be that it gaussian a the approximate distribution of the particle energy be gaussian the spectral width can be found by find the width of the curve at half the maximum intensity this spectral width coincides with the width of the peak on the interferogram with a large spectral width give a shorter width of peak on the interferogram the null point of the michelson interferometer be when the two separate beam of light travel the same distance before interfere when find the null point the only way to be sure that it be the null point which have be found be by use a white light interference this be because other interference pattern have multiple peak lead to uncertainty in which peak be the null point for example in the green laser interferogram figure 1 there be multiple peak this pattern also repeat approximately eve1y 2llllll lead to unce1tainty in whether the peak show the null point or just another constiuctive interference the reason the green laser give this `` beating `` be due to the specti•al width be so sho1t a delta function in frequency space this thus lead to ve1y large fringe width in the interferogram white light however have a large spectral v.iidth lead to ve1y sho1t peak in it interferogram make it useful in find the null point of the interferometer fourier transfom1s change the interferograllls into frequency space so that the spectral width of each of the light source can be calculate by find the width of the peak at half the maximum intensity this specti•al width demonstrates the makeup of the light source beyond it colour the tungsten light source u a filament which mean that wiens displacement law be a good approximation to the temperature of the filament where a.peak be the wavelength of great abundance in the light in m b be wien 's displacement constant equal to 2 .8977729x 10-3 mk and t be the temperature of the light source in kelvin in set up the michelson interferometer it be ensure that everything need to be con-ectly align for the best possible interferograms firstly a laser be use in the alignment of the set up -due to the accurate collimate beam the the beam splitter and light source be then place such that the light that travel through the splitter continue in a sti•aight direction where the beam splitter and light source be not perpendicular this be more accurately ensure by allow the laser to ti•avel a large distance after the splitter onto a screen and rotate the splitter to ensure this be all in line the stationary and moveable min-ors be then place along of the axis of the light from the beam splitter such that they reflect the light back to the beam splitter the distance be try to make roughly the same use a piece of sti-ing but a more accurate process follow later the reason for this u because the null point have to be in the range that the moveable minor could move otherwise it would not be easily found the laser beam then need to be make parallel v.iith the such that it travel two different path on these path it either hit a plane stationaiy llllltor or a plane moveable nwor tue plane light wave then interfere at the beaiu splitter to give an inte1ference pattem at the detector the yellow line represent the path the light take through the inte1ferometer this set up where the distance the light travel to the llll11•ors from the beam splitter be equal show the null point a l'angement surface this be do use a magnetic ruler adjust the laser and the adjustment toggle on the rniitors next the miirnrs need to be adjust such that an interference pattern be create a lens be first place on the laser this spread the light create a large image at the detector thus allow it to be easy the see the fringe create when align the beallls a screen can be place far away for a large interference pattern the stationary minor can then be adjust so that the circular interference pattern show on the screen it can be ensure that the beam travel the same path and do n't j ust meet at the screen by move the screen closer to and far from the splitter and check the interference pattern do not change the detector be then replace such that the interference pattern be centi•ed at the centi•e of the detector i.e with the centi•al maximum at the centi•e of the detector throughout this process it be vital that the optical surface remain clean and be not touch to leave any finge1prints once the interferometer be set up the null point could then be found the detector give a. graph of intensity of the light source against time when you take data point the intensity of the interference pattern at the detector be then take for a range a.round where the rough null point be of the moveable miirnr the frequency of the detector use be 50hz and so the detector need to move very slowly approximately o. lmm/s for prelirll.llla.ry result the white light source be inse1t ed in the set up and an interferogram be take for a. range approximately equal to position at which the mii -or be when the sti•ing measure the two miitors the null point be at the peak in the interference pattern and once this have be found interferograms with a slow move mirror can start to be take from figure 3 the null point be found to be approximately 7.2mm and so the interferograms be take from a range similar to this it be also note that the equipment be very sensitive to vibration for example the blip in figure 4 at approximately 6.2mm be thought to be due to vibration and in other data a bang on the surface would produce a peak up to half the size of the null point this meant that it be necessary to ensure that the surface that the equipment sat on be not touch at all time when take data upon reflection vibration could in-fact misalign the equipment meaning that a re-alignment could be conduct after each accidental vibration but this may be quite worthless a the actual effect be minimal once the null point be found interferograms could be take for a range around the null point with different light source for these data set to produce accurate interferograms the moveable mirror need to move very slowly a preliminary interferogram be take for each light source such that an approximate range of the peak could be record another final set could then be take give very precise interferograms from figure 4 the blue lead interferogram the peak width be record a 2.5x 10-5 m. this be much large than the other white light interferograms -as predict due to the sho1t spectral width of a blue lead there be also another small peak at approximately 7.275mm a this peak be not symmetrical about the central peak this must be anomalous or there be anomalous data point the side of the peak where this secondary peak isn 't present either way another interferogram should be retaken to conclude which from figure 5 the tungsten filament interferogram the peak width be record a 8.5x 10-6 m. this be much sho1t er than that of the blue lead due to the much large spectral width of the white light it be also note that there be small peak approximately 7 x 10-6 m either side of the central peak this be thought to be an inherent property of the tungsten filament a these peak be symmetrical about the central peak finally from figure 7 the white lead interferogram the peak width be record a 9 .ox 10-6 m. this peak be incredibly unifonn and symmetrical a fourier transform of the interlerograms be then take to find the spectral width of each light source figure 6 a graph of amplitude against wavelength in m for a blue lead found use a fourier transfo1m of figure 4. the distribution of wavelength in the blue lead light source could be see in figure 6. the spectral width be measw•ed to be 4.0x 10-s ± 0.5 x 10-8 m and a. gaussian be thought to be good approximation to the cwv e. the distribution of wavelength in the white lead light source could be see in figure 8. the spectral width be measure to be l.5 x 10-7 ± 0.5 x 10-7 m. there be however a dip in the cwv e at approximately 5 x 10-7 m. this could be due to a. gap in the series of wavelength that the white lead emits or a random eitor in the take of the data upon retake the data series the same result be see therefore conclude the fo1mer that there be a. gap in the series of wavelength s that the blue lead emit the distribution of wavelength in the tungsten filament lamp could be see in figure 9. the spectral width be measure to be 4.5× 10 −7 ± 0.5 × 10 −7 m. this curve be also very gaussian also use figure 9 𝜆 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 be found to be 8.8× 10 −7 m. this give a temperature of the filament to be 3292.9k a value for the temperature from 3 state that the temperature of the filament in a tungsten lamp be typically 3300k show a very similar value to that calculate from the experiment in all the interferograms there be `` noise `` affect the graph this be something which be unpreventable but it can however be reduce this can be do by reduce the vibration on the table and get high quality source of light the large the spectral width of a light source the shorter the width of it peak in an interferogram this result from this experiment agree with this statement for example the spectral width of the blue lead be 4.0× 10 −8 ± 0.5 × 10 −8 m and the white lead be and the peak width of the interferogram of the white lead be much shorter than that of the blue lead a well a this it be conclude that although the two white light source be white they be in-fact very different also the calculate temperature of the tungsten filament be found to be 3292.9k which be so close to the quote temperature of 3300k in 3 indicate a very precise set up,superficial,bal,65,0.107152678,0.892847359
45,2ndINT_MOX979_Redacted,in this report the ability of a `` motor-powered `` version of the `` michelson interferometer `` to map the spectrum of a variety of light source be test the light source use have a variety of spectrum namely gaussian lorentzian and black-body it be found that the interferometer could charactarise these source with a resolution on the scale of ∼ 5 − 100nm the range of wavelength the set-up could map be found to be from 400nm − 1000nm the interferometer be also able to differentiate between distribution in a superposition limit on the technique be also found chief be the ability to isolate the set-up from outside light and heat several suggestion on how to improve the set-up be also make i nterferometry be a technique use to probe matter use light the technique be first use by michelson and morley in their attempt to detect the aether the technique have be use to study phenomenon from the atomic scale to the stellar scale most recently it be use by the `` laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory `` in the first ever detection of gravitational wave there be many type of interferometer such a the fizeau michelson and fabry-perot interferometer however they be all base on the principle of superposition and the fact that the way two wave behave in superposition be indicative of some property of the wave in this report the ability of the michelson interferometer to characterise light source be test this be do by take interferograms use fourier analysis the limit of the method for mapping spectrum a well a method for reduce error be discus a well a this some characteristic of the light source be infer from the spectrum if the technique of interferometry be improve significantly over the next few year it could be possible to use the technique to find the chemical composition of `` exoplanets `` by mapping the absorption spectrum of light passing through the atmosphere of say planet this could lead to the first sign of organic life outwith the earth the basic michelson interferometer be show in fig 1. interference occurs when two light wave superimpose on top of each other for monochromatic light constructive interference occurs at phase shift of 2nπ and destructive interference occurs at phase shift of 2n − 1 π. this can be achieve with the interferometer by vary the value of t by integer and half-integer value of the wavelength of the light this produce an interference pattern when the mirror be move consist of peak at different value of t. in reality there be no such thing a a monochromatic source of light a the momentum of light be give by it wavelength a perfect monochromatic source with no uncertainty in wavelength would produce light with perfectly know momentum this be impossible a it violates the heisenberg uncertainty principle many light source therefore be give by a spectrum of wavelength which can be approximate by a gaussian curve this do not have a huge effect in the distance between peak but instead creates an envelope for the amplitude of the wave depend on the value of t. when t be close to zero the amplitude remains unchanged however a t increase the amplitude drop a the different wavelength across the gaussian interfere with each other the interferogram 's amplitude with t have an envelope that be related to the fourier transform of the wavelength spectrum of the light be measure this make the interferogram a fourier transform spectrometer assume that light be a gaussian the interferogram envelope can be found by look at the fourier transform which be another gaussian with a width reciprocal to the original width this mean that a wide spectrum should lead to a very narrow interferogram and vice versa to show this a simulation of the interferogram produce by several gaussians be provide by the experiment lead the interferograms of a wide spectrum and a narrow spectrum be show in fig 2. the wavelength and spread can be determine use the interferogram the mean wavelength be determine by aver- age the value of the distance between the small sinusoidal peak in the interferogram this value be then divide by two a the motor move forward by some amount cause a change of two time that amount to the path difference the spread can be determine by take spread of the interferogram and relate it to the spread in wavelength use where λ and ∆λ be the mean wavelength and spread in wavelength respectively and l be the coherence length which be related to the full width at half maximum of the interferogram 1 with the interferogram it be also possible to recover the spectrum use a fourier transform these calculation be possible due to the fact that t and 1/λ be fourier conjugate 1 to test the set-up several light source be use blue and white lead tungsten filament and the green line from a mercury lamp each light source have a distinct spectrum due to the mechanism that produce the light tungsten produce a black-body spectrum from the kinetic energy of electron in the metallic lattice which produce the light the lead should produce lorentzian distribution with the white lead also produce a second wider gaussian due to a phosphorescent component the mercury lamp produce light a electron jump energy level this lead to a narrow peak that follow a lorentzian the lorentzian be give by where i be the intensity a be the amplitude w be the width and x 0 be the average value of x which for fig 1 be the value of t. these different light source lead to wavelength distribution show in fig 3. the michelson interefrometer be set-up in accordance with fig 1. a picture be show in fig 4. with the arm be of approximately equal length before any data could be take the null point be determine the null point be the exact distance of the motor such data be take for the different source exclude the green mercury line interferograms be produce and analyse the average wavelength and spread of wavelength for the light source be show in table i. it can be see that the white lead cover the visible spectrum ∼ 400nm − 700nm with the average be ap-proximately central this be expect of a white lead in order a for it to appear white require wavelength from across the visible spectrum the blue lead have a much narrower spread suggest that it indeed produce monochromatic light the tungsten filament produce light which peak in just within the infrared however the spread be large enough that significant light be produce throughout the visible spectrum this corresponds to an orange-yellow glow the temperature of the filament can be estimate use wien 's displacement law do this give a temperature of 3625k the analysis of the interferograms produce good data for light source and be a valid proof of method however to gain far insight into the mechanism the spectrum could be investigate this be do by use the fast fourier transform fft algorithm to test the effectiveness of the algorithm the interferogram of the green line of sodium be take a green filter be use to isolate the line the fft should produce a lorentzian of when run the spectrum in fig 5 be produce it can be see that the spectrum do roughly follow a lorentzian fit the deviation could be due to either uncertainty in the interferometer set-up/fourier transform or it could be due to broadening of the spectrum in the lamp due to doppler effect the lorentzian be centre at 546nm this corresponds with an accepted mercury line at that wavelength 2 which give proof of method for the technique a the transform match well with the data assume that the peak in the spectrum be small than that of the interferogram this give the interferometer a bad case resolution of ∼ 100nm a the technique be successful for the green mercury lamp the fourier transform be take on the data for the light source in table i. these be show in fig 6 7 and 8. it can be see from fig 6 that the blue lead seem to also follow a more lorentzian curve there be some slight asymmetry in the curve this could be due to the fact that the broadening of the line in the lead be asymmetrical or that the interferogram do n't cover a large enough range of t for small wavelength to appear in the fourier transform a show in fig 7 the white lead have a more complex spectrum it be compose of a lorentzian peak at ∼ 450nm and a gaussian peak at ∼ 600nm these correspond to the light emit by the blue lead and the phosphor respectively it can be see that the method successfully capture the property of two different light source superimpose this give an indication that the technique could be able to map more complex spectrum for example the entire spectrum of element could be mapped use this technique it can be see from fig 8 that the curve do not fit the black body spectrum associate with a peak wavelength of 800nm this would suggest either the tungsten do not follow a black-body or more likely that there be some error in the detector the left side seem to follow quite closely the black-body in orange but with a rightward shift until at around 700 − 800nm the curve deviate and drop back to zero this suggests that the high wavelength infrared radiation be too low energy to be detect by the sensor and therefore do appear this would suggest that the actual peak be far into the infrared region and that the actual temperature of the filament have a low temperature than 3000k in conclusion the michelson interefrometer be able to charactarise different light source with good accuracy it be able to identify lorentzian gaussian and black-body spectraincluding when these distribution be superimpose it could also determine the mean wavelength and spread correctly within the visible spectrum the resolution be determine by the green line of mercury to be around 100nm however the plot of the blue lead in fig 6 would suggest that the uncertainty in fig 5 be due to the instability of the light source or interference cause by the filter if this be the case the resolution could be a little a 5nm to fully test the resolution a long interferogram of an extremely stable and narrow light source would need to be take the main shortcoming of the set-up seem to be that the detector be only capable of detect light within the visible spectrum attempt to fix this do present a problem the detector should produce the same response regardless of the wavelength of light use but small wavelength light have more energy and therefore will be more likely to produce a large response all object be constantly emit infrared wave at room temperature and so experiment would have to be cool down if infrared wave be go to be study so it also becomes harder and harder to isolate the interferometer a the detector becomes more sensitive to high wavelength light another problem exists for low wavelength wave from 1 a the mean wavelength decrease the coherence length also decrease until the envelope be too small to be distinguish from noise in the interferogram for these reason the michelson interferometer use be best suit for a range of wavelength from ultraviolet light to just within the infrared range this could be use to map spectrum of element and/or compound for example if other wavelength range be go to be use the interferometer will have to be adjust to suit say range future work to improve the interferometer set-up could include well isolation of the interferometer to allow for light of much low intensity to be detect an idea for isolate and cool the interferometer could be place one in space a this would isolate many

13,2ndINT_BKZ271_Redacted,we analyse the spectrum of a tungsten-halogen lamp use a fourier-transform spectrometer the spectrometer record the intensity pattern from the interference of the radiation with itself it then performs a fourier transform on this pattern and reconstructs the radiation from the source we use this reconstruct spectrum to measure the peak emission wavelength for the lamp which we found be 825 ± 0.4nm the tungsten-halogen lamp can be treat a a black-body imply that the peak wavelength be related to the temperature of the body by wien 's displacement law the temperature of the body we calculate to be 3512 ± 2k a rtificial light through have year have undergone great change from candle oil lamp and coal fire in the 18th century to cfl bulb and lead lamp today however one thing that have remain constant be that any advancement in artificial light be a milestone in history the sudden popularisation of the electric bulb when thomas edison file his first patent in 1879 1 begin a great revolution in light incandescence be the phenomenon of an object emit light due to be heat to a high temperature this be first demonstrate by ebenezer kinnersley in 1763 with a wire 2 the first incandescent bulb be make use carbon filament held in evacuate case these lamp be not efficient a most of the energy be release a heat evacuate the inside also cause the formation of a black residue 3 on the inside of the bulb far reduce it efficiency this change with the advent of tungsten filament tungsten have the high melt and boil point amongst all metal make it the ideal candidate to use in an incandescent lamp michelson and morley first invent the interferometer in search of the `` ether `` 4 although the search be unsuccessful they have create an instrument that be use even today to make precise measurement e.g ligo detector the aim of this experiment be to investigate the spectrum of the tungsten lamp and to measure the operational temperature of the lamp a fourier-transform spectrometer ft be a michelson interferometer where one of the arm have variable length the advantage of use a ft instead of a regular spectrometer be that a the ft be align use a laser the measurement be more precise a second advantage could be that the measurement make by the ft use interference fringe whereas the regular spectrometer gather data on single frequency individually another advantage be that the intensity detect be much low in a regular spectrometer due to loss in reflection transmission and also the narrow slit use to let in light 5 the michelson interferometer invent by albert michelson be an instrument that u the phenomenon of interference of light wave to function in essence a a highly precise ruler fig1 be a representation of the setup use m 1 and m 2 be mirror that act a the end of the arm of the interferometer the beam splitter 7 be an instrument that split the incident light beam into two part it be make up of two prism join together by a dielectric coat on the hypotenuse of both prism this dielectric coat reflect 50 of the beam and transmits the other 50 a for it use in this experiment the beam be split and then recombine after each part be reflect from their respective mirror and interfere on recombination the interference be either constructive or destructive depend on the difference in the distance each beam travel the coat provide an additional phase difference π to the part reflect off it this cause dark fringe destructive interference to be see when there be zero path difference the interferometer cause two beam of light to interfere and produce fringe pattern that vary base on the phase difference between the two beam the manner of interference be determine by the difference in the length of the path the beam travel if this difference be an integer multiple of the wavelength nλ then the interference be constructive and a bright plane wave output be observe if the difference in path length be an integer multiple of half the wavelength n λ 2 no light be see at the output because of the way the mirror be set up there be two possible fringe pattern visible figure 2 and 3 show the two case the case in 2 have cylindrical symmetry both mirror be perpendicular to each other and so form circular fringe call haidinger fringe the case in 3 produce straight fringe know a fizeau fringe a the mirror be not align perpendicularly since these fringe would be form on the nanometre scale for a laser source lens be use in the setup refer to section on experimental method to enlarge the image lead and incandescent bulb be extend source and hence do n't require lens to achieve this consider the usage of a laser collimate beam source and move one of the mirror in order to scan the output this scan ought to show a certain spike in intensity at a particular point along the interferogram which be know a the 'null point it be the point the move mirror be at when the two arm of the interferometer be exactly equal in length the fourier transform be a mathematical tool that represent switch from position space to frequency space or viceversa when perform on a monochromatic single frequency wave it produce a single delta function in frequency space single delta function correspond to a series of bright and dark fringe however when a second frequency be add 2 delta function the intensity record be see to be modulate and beating be observe the interferometer can be use to scan the spectrum of a source and use a fourier transform to identify the different frequencies/wavelengths be use to produce the output hence a michelson interferometer with one move arm be know a a 'fourier transform spectrometer any body whose temperature great than absolute zero radiates energy in the form of thermal radiation the temperature of a body be related to the internal energy of that body i.e hotter body have high energy incandescent bulb be make use a thin metallic wire filament with a high electrical resistance this cause it to heat up like a resistor when current pas through the rise temperature cause an increase in the energy radiation but may also melt the filament tungsten have the high melt point 3695k among the metal and so be ideal for such usage the heating of the filament follow the joule heating effect 1 every light source have a characteristic emission spectrum base on it production and so a characteristic efficiency efficiency be thus the more efficient a source be the lesser it percentage emission of heat or infrared radiation incandescent source tend to emit large amount of heat and a a consequence reach very high temperature low efficiency incandescent bulb be fill with inert gas instead of a vacuum in order to lessen the heating of the case and the evaporation of the filament material every body with a temperature great than 0k emits radiation if this body be at thermal equilibrium 2 with it environment it be say to emit black-body radiation an incandescent light source when in thermal equilibrium be consider a black-body and it radiation have a characteristic spectrum and intensity accord to planck 's law black-body radiation follow a curve know a a planck distribution 9 this curve depends solely on the equilibrium temperature of the body and not on it shape size etc wien 's law defines the relationship between the peak wavelength the wavelength at which the lamp have the high intensity of emission and the temperature of the body 9 where t represent the temperature of the body and λ peak represent the peak wavelength of the black-body radiation spectrum the source use can be either a collimate light source or an extend source e.g lead but for the purpose of setup and alignment a laser collimate source be use in order to have the most accurate alignment possible accuracy be paramount in an interferometry setup a measurement be make on the scale of wavelength of light make them highly susceptible to error mirror m 1 be mount on a linear stage that be connect to a motor the motor move the stage back and forth across a 24mm range the detector record the intensity of the light a m 1 be move to vary the length of the arm the mirror use be small and although the lab be a `` dark lab `` a lens f 100mm be use at the source to focus the beam to a point this beam now split and a point image be see in m 1 this image be use to align the beam splitter perpendicular to m 1 such that the point be centre on m 1 an adjustable mirror m 2 be now introduce in the path of beam 2 and place perpendicular to the beam splitter align the point at the centre of m 2 ensures the overlap and hence interference of the beam on recombination a white card can be use a a screen to observe a clear image to fine-tune the alignment once align a second lens f 25.4mm be use to enlarge the image if both the mirror be set exactly perpendicular to each other the observe fringe will be haidinger fringe fig3 a the green laser be monochromatic the intensity profile would just be an infinite sine wave of a certain frequency this when put through a fourier-transform 10 produce a single narrow gaussian profile with the peak wavelength at approximately 523nm a the number of contribute wavelength get large the intensity variation begin to localise about the null point refer to appendix therefore to find the null point it be necessary to have interference from a white light source we use a white lead 11 for this and found the null point to be at x −7.01244mm on the coordinate system of the linear stage a the position of the null point only depends on the length of the arm of the interferometer it must have approximately the same position for any source of light that consists of multiple frequency the detector be connect to a computer that display the amplitude of the signal vary with the position of the linear stage m 1 a m 1 pas the null point a large spike in intensity be observe the amplitude exhibit a gaussian profile with the width dependent on the number of wavelength use to produce the incident spectrum fig4 show the position of the null point a observe use the tungsten lamp the lamp use be a thorlabs sls201l tungsten-halogen lamp that have a wavelength range 360nm − 2600nm a specify by the manufacturer the tungsten lamp without a filter act a a white light source meaning it be an extend light source compose of several frequency the lamp be connect to the setup via an optical fibre cable consider that the null point must be in the same position the intensity be record from −7.2mm to −6.8mm and a show in figure 4 the null point be found at x −7.01209mm assume there be no disturbance to the setup the change in it position result from non-uniform motion of the linear stage refer to error section of result once the null point be found the record data be put through a fast fourier transform fft in order to try and reconstruct the wavelength that the source be make up of fig5 show the plot of intensity against wavelength for the tungsten-halogen lamp a expect the spectrum be a continuous gaussian with the intensity peak at a certain wavelength black-body emission spectrum be characteristic of the temperature of the body and like the lamp star too can be described a black-bodies sunlight for example have the gaussian spectrum of a body with a peak wavelength approximately 540nm 3 in order to find the peak wavelength for the lamp we fit a gaussian function fig6 to fig5 where a be the amplitude x 0 the mean intensity σ the standard deviation and k an arbitrary offset constant we might expect a similar spectrum for tungsten due to it colour and it use a a lamp but in reality the tungsten lamp have a spectrum with a peak wavelength of approximately 825nm this mean it have a high contribution from infrared light and a low contribution of blue light a compare to sun and be what give an incandescent light source it characteristic yellow colour the error in the peak wavelength be calculate from the covariance of the fit parameter and be σ λ 0.4nm hence the peak wavelength be once we found the peak wavelength of the tungsten lamp we use wien 's law to calculate the temperature of the tungsten filament this come out to be the error in the temperature be calculate a follow iv result when take data number of sample to be record be one of the input a the detector sample at 50hz if the number input be not complete when the stage reach it destination it move a few nanometre back and forth and keep sample until either manually stop or the input condition be met another possibility be to set the number of sample base on the speed and scan range but the position of the null point still shift this could be due to the stage not cover a constant distance between two sample in principle the distance between consecutive sample be large or small than require so there be no constant value for the overshoot or undershoot of the stage the intensity of the tungsten lamp 's radiation must follow a planck disrtribution for a give wavelength but a observe in fig6 the intensity behaves approximately a a gaussian distribution this be cause by the detector have a fix range of sensitivity outside of which it do n't detect intensity this range be from 300nm to 1100nm with the peak sensitivity at 940nm a a result of this the wavelength from 1100nm to 2600nm be absent in the spectrum the operation temperature of the lamp a in the data sheet 12 be t rat 2796 k 7 fig7 show the true spectral power distribution of the lamp superimpose over that measure by the detector it be apparent from the fig7 that the true wavelength of maximum emission be outside the range of the detector thereby cause the difference ≈ 700k of the experimental result to the datasheet therefore the detector be a major source of systematic error in the experiment in conclusion we measure the temperature of the tungsten filament to be t f ilament 3512 ± 2k use the fouriertransform spectrometer the fourier transform itself be do use the scipy package on python a an incandescent lamp tungsten lamp be the most widely use a tungsten have the high melt point 3695k amongst all metal the measure temperature however be close to the melt point of tungsten meaning the filament must be evaporate rapidly even in the inert gas environment the result also translates to the filament be very fragile and near it break point however on accounting for the systematic error we observe that the lamp must be at a low temperature,extended,exp,70,0.120430484,0.87956953

displacement law and stefan-boltzmann 's law it be found the blue lead have a wavelength of 483.1 ± 0.4 nm the white lead have an average wavelength of 549.9 ± 0.8 nm the tungsten source with the no filter have an average wavelength of 563.3 ± 0.9 nm the tungsten with a yellow filter have a wavelength of 569.7 ± 0.6 nm finally the tungsten source with a green filter have a wavelength of 555.4 ± 0.4 nm the power radiate per unit area be found to be 3.672 ± 0.054 ×10 7 wm -2 for the tungsten source with no filter for the tungsten source with a green filter the power radiate per unit area be 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 while the tungsten source with a green filter have a power output per unit area of 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 the main error associate with the experiment be the fact that the fitting function assume that the distance between consecutive measurement be constant nterferometry have be an incredible useful technique throughout history from it invention in 1887 by albert a. michelson and edward w. morley to disprove the aether which lead to einstein 's theory of special relativity to the modern-day find of gravitational wave 1 this technique which relies on the principle of the interference of light be still relevant and essential to the modern scientist we will use interferometry to first measure the wavelength of a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten lamp with various filter then by assume the tungsten source be a black-body investigate the power radiate per unit area by tungsten with the differ filter in this experiment we will construct a traditional michelson and morley interferometer with a tilt mirror and a translation mirror interferometry relies on the coherence of the light beam to produce an interference pattern by move the translation mirror the coherence will change cause a visible change in the interference pattern we will use this effect to measure the various wavelength of the source and use this find the temperature and power radiate per unit area for the black-body source interferometry allows u to measure small distance accurately thus we should obtain an accurate and precise measurement of the wavelength coherent wave be two wave which have a constant phase difference the same frequency and similar waveform the measure of how well the wave meet these criterion be call coherence when two coherent monochromatic wave meet the 2 wave will superpose add together and form an interference pattern like that show in figure 1. at place where a wave peak from one wave meet another wave peak constructive inference occurs at place where a wave peak from one wave meet another wave trough destructive inference occurs mathematically constructive interference be give by ∆𝐿 𝑚𝜆 and destructive interference be give by ∆𝐿 𝑚 0.5 𝜆 where ∆𝐿 be the path difference between the wave difference be distance the 2 wave have travel if they have the same source m be any integer and λ be the wavelength of light if the wave be n't monochromatic and be make of many wavelength each wavelength of the same value will interfere this cause point of constructive and destructive interference of each wavelength a show in figure 1. if the path difference be constant the point of constructive inference and destructive remain the same form a stationary still pattern find the wavelength and power radiate per unit area of black-body source use interferometry i iii method the experiment be setup a show in figure 2 with the whole apparatus on an optical board in an opaque black plastic box to absorb external light the two mirror be set approximately equal distance from the beam splitter a green laser be use a a source to align the interferometer the detector be replace by a piece of card and use the adjustment nob on the tilt mirror the two beam through the beam splitter be make incident on the same point on the card this result in faint parallel fridge in the diffract light surround the beam point then a 25.4 mm convex lens follow by a long tube be put between the laser and beam splitter this enlarge the interference pattern such that it be visible the mirror be then tilt in the horizontal plane until circular fridge where see the piece of card be then replace by detector and the circular fridge be centre on the detector the null point be then found by move the motorize translation mirror through the full range which it can move this be do by set the translation mirror to -12mm then run it to 12mm at speed of 0.02 mm -1 the interferogram be plot use the point of maximum and minimum intensity be identify a the null point the null point be found to be between 2.9 mm to 3 mm on the translation mirror scale the lens and laser be then replace by the white lead source follow by ground glass the translation mirror be then move about the null point from 2.9 mm to 3 mm on the translation mirror scale at a speed of 0.001 mm -1 the interferogram be plot this be repeat with the blue lead this be also repeat with a tungsten source with no filter a yellow filter and green filter however with the tungsten source a collimator and the lens be place in front of the source while the filter be place between the beam splitter and detector and the ground glass be remove then the interferogram be fit to a sine wave and a histogram be plot to show the various wavelength in the source use the plot the most predominant wavelength be found or an average wavelength be calculate use equation 4 and 5 the temperature and power radiate per unit area be found for the tungsten source the blue lead be found to contain several wavelength around the blue wavelength of light however a wavelength of 483.1 ± 0.4 nm be by far the most predominant the interferogram be show below in figure 4. the interferogram show the sinusoidal change in signal strength with distance around the null point the maximum signal strength of this waveform increase and the minimum signal strength decrease this be contain within an envelope center on the null point the white lead be found to contain several wavelength around the visible light range however the weight average wavelength be 549.9 ± 0.8 nm the reason the average be weight be due to the fact that the white lead have a wavelength of 488.2 ± 0.3 nm in blue wavelength range which be twice a intense a the other wavelength i believe this be due to the fact that the source produce the various wavelength in an asymmetric distribution this be see when the lead be direct at a distance it become slightly blue tint moreover the interferogram show in figure 5 be asymmetric the tungsten source with the no filter be found to contain wavelength around the yellow and green wavelength of light a show in figure 6. the average wavelength be 563.3 ± 0.9 nm the temperature be found to be 5145 ± 8 k and a power output per unit area of 3.672 ± 0.054 ×10 7 wm -2 the tungsten source with the yellow filter be found to contain a predominant wavelength in the yellow wavelength of light at 569.7 ± 0.6 nm a show in figure 7. the temperature be found to be 5087 ± 5 k and a power output per unit area of 3.797 ± 0.016 ×10 7 wm -2 the tungsten source with the green filter be found to contain several wavelength around the green wavelength of light however a wavelength of 555.4 ± 0.4 nm be by far the most predominant a show in figure 8. the temperature be found to be 5218 ± 4 k and a power output per unit area of 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 the effective temperature of the sun be 5778 k 10 which be similar to the temperature of the source moreover the power radiate per unit area by the sun be 6.14×10 7 wm -2 which be also similar to those we obtain this be due to the fact that the sun mainly emits visible light a the source do the error in the wavelength ∆𝜆 be take a the maximum histogram bar size from this the error in the temperature ∆𝑇 be give by ∆𝑇 𝑇∆𝜆 𝜆 the error in the power radiate per unit area ∆𝑃 be give by ∆𝑃 𝑃∆𝑇 𝑇 the error fails to include the fact that while the apparatus be on an optical bench it be still very sensitive to vibration due to the fact small distance be be measure this be difficult to control when there be many people walk around the lab also external light may have enter the apparatus even though it be cover in an opaque plastic box there be hole in the box to allow cable out of the apparatus which light could diffract through the small the whole the more diffraction would occur however the large the hole the grater the intensity of the light which diffracts furthermore in our calculation for fitting the wavelength we assume the translation mirror move by a constant distance every time it take a measurement however this be not the case the mirror take measurement at a frequency of 50 hz but the distance between these measurement varied more accurate data could have be take if the resolution of the interference pattern be well the resolution r be give by the expression 11 𝜆 thus the resolution be dependent on the distance the mirror move if measurement be take over a great range about the null point the uncertainty in the wavelength would decrease the aim of this investigation be to use interferometry to find the wavelength of various source we do this by construct our own interferometer with a translation mirror we observe how the interference pattern and coherence change by measure how the signal strength varied at a point on the interference pattern with the translation mirror move about the null point it be found the blue lead have a wavelength of 483.1 ± 0.4 nm the white lead have an average wavelength of 549.9 ± 0.8 nm but have predominant blue wavelength at 488.2 ± 0.3 nm due to the asymmetric distribution of wavelength the tungsten source with the no filter be found to contain wavelength around the yellow and green wavelength of light with the average wavelength of 563.3 ± 0.9 nm the tungsten with the yellow filter be found to contain a predominant wavelength in the yellow wavelength of light at 569.7 ± 0.6 nm finally the tungsten source with the green filter be found to contain several wavelength around the green wavelength of light however a wavelength of 555.4 ± 0.4 nm be by far the most predominant we then use the wavelength for the tungsten source to find the power radiate per unit area by assume they be black-bodies and apply wien 's displacement law and stefan-boltzmann 's law the power radiate per unit area be found to be 3.672 ± 0.054 ×10 7 wm -2 for the tungsten source with no filter for the tungsten source with a green filter the power radiate per unit area be 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 while the tungsten source with the green filter have a power output per unit area of 4.203 ± 0.012 ×10 7 wm -2 these result be similar to those from sun which have a power radiate per unit area of 6.14×10 7 wm -2 10 the main error associate with the experiment be the fact that the fitting function assume that the distance between consecutive measurement be constant,extended,the,55,0.128368363,0.871631563
63,2ndINT_FHG790_Redacted,a michelson interferometer be create use two plane mirror and beam splitter interferograms around the null point of the interferometer be then record for a white lead and a tungsten filament lamp the fourier transforms of the interference pattern be then take to give the amplitude a a function of wavelength for each source the result wavelength spectrum be then compare for their efficiency in radiate energy in the visible spectrum this experiment result in the tungsten filament emit 20.5 ± 0.2 of it energy in the visible whereas the lead emit 98 ± 0.5 of it power in the same range he wave theory of light be first propose in 1690 by christian huygens evidence support this theory be found in around 1800 by thomas young in his famous double slit experiment it be this wave theory of light that be central to understand interferometry -as it relies on the superposition principle interferometry be famously use in the 1887 michelson-morley experiment in which they search for the presence of the 'luminiferous aether a no variation in the speed of light be detect a new theory be require this lead to the development of special relativity by albert einstein the technique of interferometry be still very much at the fore-front of scientific research a very precise measure device can be design upon it principle currently interferometer be be use to measure the tiny change in length cause by gravitational wave in this experiment interferograms of a tungsten filament lamp and a white lead be record the fourier transform of the data be then take to provide the wavelength spectrum of the light source the efficiency of the source in emit visible light be then compare interference occurs when two or more wave interact the result pattern produce depends on the amplitude of each wave at that position there be an alternate pattern of bright and dark fringe a the wave oscillate from interfere constructively to destructively for monochromatic light of equal amplitude the pattern be a function of the phase difference between the wave in the case of an interferometer this phase difference be cause by the fact that one wave have travel a different distance relative to the other fourier analysis be require to consider light with an arbitrary frequency spectrum this result in the follow relation between j the interferogram and s the power spectrum of the source where ∆ be the distance from the null point and ν be frequency j be the fourier cosine transform of the spectral power density s 1 a hot filament will glow with a characteristic frequency spectrum the wavelength at which the peak of this spectrum occurs be give by the follow equation the spectrum will be approximately gaussian in it distribution a there be slight random variation in temperature within the filament which be normally distribute about a mean value lead 's work on the phenomenon of electroluminescence where electron recombine with hole in a semiconductor release light a they do so if there be some element of randomness in the energy release when the electron recombine then it can also be expect that the lead 's spectrum will have some sort of gaussian distribution a michelson interferometer consists of a beam splitter and two plane mirror arrange a show in fig 1. the system be very sensitive to vibration and therefore must be isolated from the surroundings to reduce erroneous noise in the data this be achieve by place the component on an optical breadboard the whole system be position within a blacked-out box and the light in the laboratory be turn off so that the effect of variation in the ambient light be minimise the detector be also shield from the light source use tube and piece of black card in order for reliable data to be take the interferometer have to be carefully align initially the translational mi1rnr be fix in place on it translation stage the beam splitter be then position a sho1t distance away and it orientation be adjust until it be at 45 degree to the translational minor this be achieve use a laser and adjudge to be when the laser beam reflect by the beam splitter and it reflection from the translational minor fonned one spot on the beam splitter the rotatable minor be then position approximately the same distance away from the beam splitter -as measure by a piece of string a piece of white card be then put in the position of the detector and move a far away from the beam splitter a feasibly possible the position of the beam from the translational mirror on the card be then marked the orientation of the rotatable miitor be then adjust so that the beam from each arm form one spot on the piece of card this be adj udged to be when there be no discemible change in shape when one of the beam be block there may also be some additional spot on the card however these can be minimise with careful alignment a magnetic rnler be then use to verify that the laser beam be the same height above the optical breadboard in all place meaning that the system be in an optical plane a planoconvex lens of focal length 25.4mm be then position between the laser and the beam splitter to make the laser an extend source the interference pattem on the card be then clearly visible with the naked eye the orientation of the rotatable miirnr be then finetuned so that the centre of the circular fringe be in the same position a the mark on the card a michelson interferometer can produce fringe in concentric circle or straight line which be visible depends on whether the two mirror be a1rnnged so that they be perpendicular or not a the miitors be move fuither away from be pe1pendicular the fringe become straighter and closer together for this experiment it be not a requirement to have the miirnrs perpendicular a the fringe move at the same rate irrespective of their shape finally the detector a photodiode connect to an amplifier with variable gain be position so that the centre of the circular fringe be at it centre the detector use responds linearly to light intensity meaning that the data it record can be directly plot a the intensity of the light 2 in arbitrary unit the interferometer be now align however the null point still need to be found to do this the translate mirror be put at approximately the same distance from the beam splitter a the rotational mirror -again use the piece of string a quick interferogram be take with white light in a range a couple of mm either side of this position with the maximum in intensity of the interferogram correspond to the null point of the interferometer white light should be use in find the null point a once the interferogram have retwned to a. constant value either side of the pa.ttem you can be sure that the maximum of the interferogram corresponds to the null point of the interferometer -provided there be no asymmetrical phase shift cause by the optic use once the interferometer have be align and the null point found data be take in a small range either side use the light source of interest a tungsten lamp with fibre couple be use a the first white light source -producing the interferogram show in fig 3. fibre couple be necessary to make the sow•ce small enough to fit in the interferometer it be a graph of signal strength 14000 to 26000 in arbitra1y unit against position 8.47 to 8.5 in mm when the fourier transform of this data be take a graph of intensity agairlst wavelength can be plot a shov 'il in wavelength m le-7 fig 4 a graph of amplitude arbitnuy unit against wavelength m for the tungsten filament lamp a expect the wavelength spectmm be well approximate by a gaussian distribution the peak occurs at 860 ± 5 nm with a spread in the wavelength of 115 ± 2 nm this corresponds to a black body temperature of 3370 ± 20 k. a the energy of a photon be inversely propo1t ional to it wavelength the sum of the amplitude divide by the wavelength they correspond to be a representation of the total energy in the spectmm the propo1tion of that energy that fall in the visible range 400 -700 run can then be calculate this result in an efficiency of20.5 ± 0.2 at first glance the interferogram of the lead fig 5 look remarkably similar to that of the tungsten filament lamp -i :1 5 an inte1ferogram for the white lead it be a graph of signal strength 20000 to 140000 in arbitrary unit against position 8.46 to 8.49 in mm however when the fourier transform be take and plot fig 6 the two wavelength spectrum be distinctly different the spectmm be fairly well approximate by the sum of t\¥ 0 gaussian distribution the main p eak be at a wavelength of 575 ± 3 nm with a spread of 62.5 ± 0.9 run and the subsidiaiy peak be at 445 ± 2 run with a spread of 12.5 ± 0.5 nm if the temperature that the p eaks correspond to be weight accord to the amplitude of the peak then it give a black body temperature of 5600 ± 30 k. the efficiency in radiate light in the visible region be 98 ± 0.5 this experiment aim to compai•e the efficiency of two white light source in emit radiation in the visible region of the spectrum this be achieve by record an interferogram for each source use a michelson interferometer and then compute the wavelength spectmm of the sow•ces this result in the tungsten filament lamp be vastly less efficient than the white lead in a futw•e experiment the efficiency of a great airny of source should be compare the efficiency in produce light should also be compare to get an overall efficiency for the light in convert the power supply to visible

25,2ndINT_AAN562_Redacted,michelson interferometer be construct and use to obtain the interferograms of various light source namely a white lead a tungsten source and a mercury vapor lamp a fast fourier transform be later perform on these interferograms to obtain the spectrum of these light source use this spectroscopy method we determine the characteristic a well a composition of the light source which we investigate the white lead and tungsten source be observe to be light source with continuous wavelength spectrum while the mercury lamp source emit light at discrete wavelength these observation be consistent with the physic behind the emission of light from the source lead 's have energy band within them while a tungsten source behaves a a black body radiation emitter and the mercury lamp emits light through atomic transition the michelson interferometer prove to be precise in examine the light source although there be a few limitation and source of error due to the restriction of equipment and compute power with improvement to the equipment and more compute power the michelson interferometer could be use for more advanced application such a high resolution spectroscopy i nterferometry be a method of superimpose wave upon one another to create an interference pattern from which information can be obtain a famous experiment in which interferometry be use be the 'failed michelson-morley experiment from which light be proven to have a constant speed in all frame and from which the foundation of einstein 's postulate of special relativity could be laid the interferometer when combine with fourier transforms essentially becomes a spectrometer this be a very powerful technique that allows u to obtain and study the spectrum of light source with this method we could for example analyse the spectrum of astronomical body and predict their composition 2 in this experiment a michelson interferometer be construct and use to obtain the interference pattern or interferograms of several light source fast fourier transforms be then apply to the interferograms to obtain the spectrum of the light source which we then use to study the characteristic of the light source the layout of the michelson interferometer be show in fig 1. a light source emits light which be split into two beam when incident upon the beam splitter the two beam be then reflect by mirror m1 and m2 back into the beam splitter where they recombine and be direct towards a photodetector which measure the intensity of the recombine light beam in the michelson interferometer the beam splitter consists of a dielectric plate which induces a phase change of π 2 on one of the beam assume a monochromatic light source of wavelength λ there be destructive interference between the two recombine beam when the path difference between the beam be zero or an integer multiple of λ and constructive interference occurs when the path difference be an odd integer multiple of λ 2 the two type of interference be record by the photodetector a dark low intensity and bright high intensity fringe respectively hence if we be to vary the position of either mirror m1 or m2 we could produce an interference pattern about a null point the point at which the path difference be zero and the light wave interfere destructively 1 nyquist 's theorem nyquist 's theorem state that in order to retain sufficient information from an original waveform the sample rate of a detector should be at least twice the frequency of the incident wave in term of the distance the sample distance can be at most half the wavelength of the incident wave therefore the rate at which the position of the mirror be varied should be such that we fulfil the condition of the nyquist theorem so we can obtain accurate interferograms and spectrum of the light source 2 b. fourier transform spectroscopy perform a fourier transform on an interferogram of a wave give u the spectrum of frequency or wavelength for the wave depend on the measurement take the obtain interferogram and spectrum of a wave allows u to analyse the characteristic of the wave a well a the characteristic of the wave source one significant characteristic we can observe from the interferogram and the spectrum of a light wave be the width a explain in fig 2. fig 2. the fourier transform of a narrow gaussian spectrum result in a broad interferogram and vice versa an inverse fourier transform can instead be perform on the interferogram a well follow the same forementioned principle adapt from 1 we can determine from the width of the interferogram and the spectrum of a light wave the composition of the light wave for example a light wave of a very discrete wavelength such a a laser beam would have an interferogram with a large width and a narrow spectrum while a light wave comprise light of multiple wavelength would have a narrow interferogram and a broad spectrum the interferometer be set up a show in 3. all component be secure into the metal table with placeholder a monochromatic green laser be then use for the initial alignment of the interferometer by ensure the laser beam reflect off the 2 mirror be superimpose on each other this be make easy use the 10.0 mm and 2.5 mm lens a white lead be later use a well a move the mirror at a constant speed to determine the null point of the interferometer a fringe pattern for white light could only be observe around the null point a ground glass diffuser be use to increase the dispersion of the white light once the null point be determine up to an accuracy of ±0.001mm we then measure and obtain interferograms from light source about the null point give that the photodetector have a sample rate of 50 hz and that the light source in our investigation have a range of wavelength from 400 to 800 nanometre the speed of the motor be set at a default of 0.001 mm s −1 give a sample distance of 20 nanometre which be well below half the minimum wavelength of the light source under investigation satisfy the condition of the nyquist theorem we then proceed to obtain and investigate the interferograms of the white lead tungsten source and mercury lamp source a significant source of error be the inconsistency of the motor on which the translatable mirror be instal possible imperfection in the motor cause the mirror to move at a speed which be not constant which lead to error when perform fast fourier transforms on the obtain interferograms to determine the spectrum of the investigate light wave another significant source of error be the limitation of the fft perform by the computer a it be a very basic program which simply allow u to extract the spectrum of a light source from it interferogram.further possible source of error include misalignment of equipment due to knock on the metal platform for the interferometer a well a filth on the mirror or lens these error be dealt with by cleaning the lens a well a handle the equipment with great care throughout the experiment the position of the null point be also measure again whenever there be a misalignment in the interferometer setup the obtain interferogram for the white lead be show in fig 4. we observe a narrow interferogram a expect since white light be a combination of light of different wavelength over a broad spectrum however the interferogram appear to be asymmetric which be uncharacteristic of white light a it should be approximate a a dirac delta function upon perform an fft on the interferogram we find that the spectrum of the white lead a show in fig 5 deviate significantly from the expect trend we observe from this deviation that the white lead emits light comprise the spectrum of blue and yellow light the combination of which the human eye perceives a white light the obtain result agree with the band theory of lead a hole and electron from the `` p-side `` and `` n-side `` recombine energy be release in the form of photon which have a continuous range of energy due to the energy band within the semiconductor diode this continuous range of photon energy translates into the continuous wavelength spectrum we observe from the white lead 3 the interferogram of the tungsten source be show in fig 6. the tungsten source be turn on and left until it heat up to a constant temperature before measurement be take the interferogram of the tungsten source be almost a narrow line give rise to the explanation that the tungsten source emits a continuous spectrum of light a show in it fft fig 7. we observe that the spectrum of tungsten can almost be approximate a a smooth gaussian curve this be consistent with the physical explanation that tungsten emits blackbody radiation when heat up lead to the observe continuous spectrum the measure spectrum of mercury be show in fig 8 with the spectrum for the green and yellow filter plot on the same graph we find that the spectrum of mercury have many discrete peak with significant peak around the green 530-560 nm and yellow 560-590 region in contrast to the previous investigate light source we find that the mercury vapor lamp emits light of discrete wavelength which be consistent with the physical model of mercury emit light through it electronic transition between different state a each electron in an atom can only occupy discrete energy level a a current be pas through a body of mercury vapor the atomic electron become excite and move into a high energy level before be de-excited and move back to it original energy level a they fall back to it original state the excitation energy be release in the form of photon which now have a discrete wavelength due to the discrete electronic energy level 4 although not reflect clearly in the compute fft spectrum due to the limitation of the fft program the visible green and yellow light wave emit by the mercury vapor lamp have very specific wavelength 546.075 nm green 576.961 nm yellow and 579.067 nm yellow 5 upon far investigation we be able to observe consistent beating in the interferogram of the mercury vapor lamp when the yellow filter be fix on fig 9 this prof the existence of the yellow doublet in mercury 's atomic spectrum we construct and configure a michelson interferometer to obtain the interferograms of a white lead a tungsten source and a mercury vapor lamp a fast fourier transform be then perform on these interferograms to obtain the spectrum of the light source we be then able to investigate the characteristic a well a composition of the light source the white lead and tungsten source be observe to be light source with continuous wavelength spectrum while the mercury lamp source emit light at discrete wavelength these observation be consistent with the physic behind the emission of light from the source lead 's have energy band within them while a tungsten source behaves a a black body radiation emitter and the mercury lamp emits light thorugh atomic transition the michelson interferometer prove to be precise in examine the light source obtain very accurate interferograms of each light source however there be significant limitation and source of error the main one be the inconsistent speed of the motor and the fft program which restrict a more thorough investigation of the light sources.despite these shortcoming we be still able to perform a good investigation and obtain huge insight on the light source we use with improvement to the equipment and more compute power the michelson interferometer could be use for wider and more

high uncertainty but em wave posse a wave-like-property interference with this property the microscopic scale of em wave can be magnify into observable and stable fringe macroscopic interference pattern interferometer utilize interference can be use to measure observables in a microscopic preciseness for example distance wavelength and dielectric constant due to the disturbance of gravitation on the propagation of em wave interferometer can also be exploit a a gravitational wave detector one of the famous detector be know a ligo interferometer split a beam of em wave into several different beam usually two that travel different route and end up meeting and interfere with each other project an interference pattern the interferogram be the graph of interference amplitude a a function of the difference in distance that beam travel can be use to extract information about the difference in phase shift between beam that travel in different route therefore for a monochromatic wave from the phase shift the difference in distance give the wavelength of em wave use or the wavelength give the difference in distance em wave travel can be measure michelson interferometer design by albert abraham michelson be use in this experiment it be use a a solid prove that the speed of light be constant and invariant from different the direction the light travel the interferometer contains a beam splitter that split light beam toward to two vertical arm both beam be reflect by mirror to travel back to the beam splitter where they interfere this will be explain far in the method part spectrometer be equipment that decompose and measure the wavelength from an input light interferometer a mention previously can be use to measure the wavelength of a monochromatic wave for non-ideal wave contain a spectrum of wave length can be decompose and measure by apply fourier transform on the interferogram which give the distribution of the wavelength of the light therefore interferometer can be use a a spectrometer this be call fourier transform spectrometer a monochromatic wave with wave number 𝑘 can be express a a function of distance the light travel or in complex form where 𝑔 𝑥 be the amplitude normally a wave be the combination with infinite monochromatic wave with different amplitude and wavelength the wave function of the wave can be write in and accord to inverse fourier

𝜎 𝛿𝑥 be the standard deviation of the distribution and obeys this describes the interferogram a a cosine wave with the two time the period equal the mean wavelength of the spectrum and have a envelop shape like gaussian function i k can be approximate a a gaussian distribution equation 11 show the wave packet of 𝐼 𝛿𝑥 be close to gaussian distribution a well and two distribution share a standard deviation relationship of described by equation 12 the wave number and coherence length be take a full width half amplitude δ𝑘 and l and their relation be consider to the propagation of error where δ𝜆 be the uncertainty on wavelength therefore the relation between δ𝜆 and coherence length can be express a 2𝜋𝐿 15 since the more data mean the more processing on data sometimes the less data acquire the well however if data be not enough aliasing might occur a show in figure 3 nyquist theorem describes the maximum separation between two data that could avoid data from be aliasing where t be the maximum sample distance a michelson interferometer a show in figure 4 contains a beam splitter which be a semi-transparent mirror that be capable of splitting a light beam into two vertical beam a mirror m1 on a stage the can be control by computer to move forward and backward a fix but adjustable mirror m and a light detector the light source be place at the in put of the light splitter the mirror m1 and the mirror m2 be place at the two outlet of the beam splitter with similar distance to the outlet and the detector be place on the other side of the splitter to m2 when the light source be turn on a half of the beam go through the semi-transparent mirror and travel to m1 and the other half be reflect by the semi-transparent mirror and travel toward m2 the beam travel toward m1 be reflect by m1 and travel back to the beam splitter where the beam be reflect by the semitransparent mirror to the detector the beam that travel to m2 be reflect back to the beam splitter where the beam passing through the semi-transparent mirror and reach the detector when both beam reflect back to meet at the splitter they interfere with each other project an interference pattern on the detector when record the interferogram the stage be set to move therefore change the difference in distance two beam travel and the detector be adjust to a proper gain to record the plot of intensity record by the detector against the position of m2 be plot which be the interferogram to take data base on the interferometer the calibration be require since the mirror stage be fix the splitter be need to be adjust first to ensure the beam reflect aim at the centre of the mirror m1 and be vertical to the surface of the mirror the green laser be turn on and a black board be place between the splitter and the detector two light spot appear on it s1 and s2 a show in figure 5 one have high intensity than the other the strong spot s1 be generate by the beam reflect from m1 the weaker spot s2 be due to the reflection with in the beam splitter the beam reflect with in the splitter be exactly vertical to the splitter therefore to align splitter with m1 splitter be move and turn to coincide s1 with s2 to align mirror m2 with the splitter m2 be move until the laser from the splitter aim at the centre of the mirror then m2 be tilt until the spot from m2 be approximately coincident with s2 the black board be remove and the detector be adjust so that the laser spot aim directly at the detector a 10mm focus lens be equip with the laser and the interference pattern show tilt m2 until the centre of the fringe be at the centre of the image the green laser be switch with the white lead the difference in distance between m1 and m2 to the splitter be measure and be within -1~-2mm the stage be set to move from -1mm to -2mm to generate the interferogram from the detector to find the null point where the distance that two beam travel be the same and the interference be the strong at this point the null point be found to be around -1.817mm the stage be move to the null point far recalibration with the green laser be do by tilt m2 to have the centre of the fringe in the middle when m1 be at the null point to avoid the change in alignment while m1 be move be the beam reflect by m1 s2 be the beam reflect within the splitter the light source be replace with white lead blue lead and tungsten light for tungsten light the green and yellow filter be place in the front of the detector for each case set the stage to move from -1 mm and 1 mm from the null point the detector be default to take 50 data per second accord to nyquist theorem the average maximum speed for the stage to move be 0.007mm/s the interferograms be plot and the fourier transforms on interferograms be plot the interferograms and fourier transforms on interferograms of white lead blue lead and tungsten lamp with yellow and green filter be show below for fourier transforms the wave number have be turn into wavelength the scale interferograms and fourier transforms be displace in the appendix a. a mention before em wave do not present to be monochromatic wave instead they be compose by wave with different wavelength and the power spectrum of wavelength be these fourier transforms of interferograms accord to equation 10 in figure 7 and figure 9 it can be conclude that the wavelength distribution of the blue lead and the tungsten lamp be approximately gaussian the tungsten light have a broad range in spectrum where 70 of the power distribute out of the visible range which be infer-red this mean that if a tungsten lamp be use a an illumination source nearly 70 of the power be waste and in visible range the spectrum skews to the large wave length therefore the overall color of a tungsten lamp present to be orange and since their spectrum be gaussian the shape of the interferogram be a described in equation 11 a cosine wave with the two time the period equal the mean wavelength of the spectrum and have a envelop shape like gaussian function and the coherence length take by the fwhm in this experiment be show below from figure 10 the shape of the wave packet of the interferogram be asymmetrical compare to blue lead and tungsten lamp this be because that the white lead have two peak a show in figure 11 the broad peak be consider to be two gaussian function red and green in superposition and the thin peak be close to the blue spectrum this can be told from table 1 that the large peak have a mean wavelength similar to the mean wavelength of red and green and small peak have a mean wavelength like blue this implies that the white lead be compose by three light source red green and blue in contrast with tungsten light the efficiency of white lead be much high due to it thin spectrum with most of the frequency in the visible range both interferograms and spectrum of the tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter be similar but different in width spectrum of both show a main peak in the middle and a few side peak with left side slightly high than right side accord to figure 12 to 15 the multiple peak could be the result of multiple band of filter that the filter do not just allow wave with one frequency range to go through but multiple of them generate small wave packet in the interferogram or this could be the result of noise or misalignment refer to the contrast to the tungsten lamp spectrum in figure 13 and 15 the asymmetrical amplitude of side peak from spectrum of green and yellow filter have a correlation to the slope of spectrum of tungsten lamp which be to say the side peak be from tungsten lamp a well instead of noise and misalignment this probably suggest that both filter use in the experiment be nonideal which do not just have one band the michelson interferometer can be use a a fourier transform interferometer to extract power spectrum on wavelength from interferogram light source be usually compose by one or more single light source for each single light source the power spectrum can be approximate a a gaussian function the wave packet of the interferogram generate by a light source in an interferometer be like gaussian function a well the period of the interferogram be the half of the mean wavelength and the width of both obeys uncertainty principle in the experiment it be notice that the intensity record from the detector shift up and down slightly from an experiment to another for the same light source with the same gain this be consider to be the fluctuation of the power of the light source also the null point be found to be shift from time to time a well in significant scale even with the identical experimental set up this could be due to various of factor like thermal expansion but these error do not disturb the experiment significantly interferograms of white and blue lead and tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter and it fourier transforms all interferograms and fourier transforms be in the same scale this can be use to compare the coherence length of the interferogram and fwhm of the spectrum,deep,the,70,0.149243072,0.850756943
27,2ndINT_NPG050_Redacted,abstract-the objective be to verify tungsten a a black-body radiator by use a spectrum to determine it operational temperature a michelson interferometer be use to obtain a spectrum for a tungsten filament the peak wavelength of the spectrum corresponds to a false peak due to the detector be unable to measure infrared wavelength a projection be make use a curve fit of the valid data to planck 's law the fitting error be too large and so the experiment be determine to be inconclusive improvement to the experiment can be make by use a more sensitive photodetector our aim be to determine if tungsten filament radiates a blackbody base on it wavelength spectrum this be do by look at the continuity of the spectrum and determine the operational temperature by use wein 's displacement law we hope to produce a spectrum for white tungsten light by use a michelson interferometer to obtain an interferogram and perform a fast-fourier transform fft produce a spectrum fig 1 show the schematic for a michelson interferometer light from the source travel to the beam splitter which sends the ray along perpendicular path the perpendicular light ray reflect off the mirror and recombine back at the beam splitter the recombine light be sent towards the photodetector the recombination result in an interference pattern be produce at the detector depend on the path difference of the ray consider the simplify model for the interferometer in fig 2. an equation for constructive interference can be obtain where 𝑡 be the difference in the distance between the beam splitter and the mirror in the interferometer 𝜃 be the angle of incident and reflection in the model 𝑚 be the order number of the maximum intensity fringe of the interference pattern and 𝜆 be the wavelength of the light see appendix for the derivation it be clear to see that the path difference 𝑚𝜆 be proportional to the arm length difference 𝑡. for monochromatic light interference pattern can be observe for a large range of 𝑡 a the coherence length of the light be large however for observe white light which consist of many wavelength result in a much shorter coherence length interference pattern will only be see around the null point null point be observe when 𝑡 0 m. by move the automate mirror within a small range through the null point an interferogram can be obtain by plot the detector reading against the position of the automate mirror a spectrum be obtain by use python to perform fft to convert the position-space data into wavelength-space data black-body radiation be thermal electromagnetic em radiation release by an object in thermal equilibrium the specific spectrum of the emit radiation be dependent on the temperature of the object 1 the spectral density of the black body radiation at a give temperature be described by planck 's law where ℎ be the planck 's constant 𝑘 𝐵 be the boltzmann constant 𝑐 be the speed of light and 𝑇 be the absolute surface temperature 𝑇 in the case of a thin tungsten filament be the operational temperature a it be assume that the temperature investigate tungsten a a black-body radiator opaque tube be the same throughout the filament the filament be also assume to be at thennal equilibrium wien 's displacement law state that the peak wavelength for a black body be inversely proportional to it temperature 3 where bi the wein 's displacement constant and amax be the peak wavelength of the spectium by examine the spectium use planck s law and wien 's law one can calculate the operational temperature for a tungsten filament typical temperature for tungsten filament be approximately 2800 k during usage 2 a. detail on the set-up fig 1 show the set up for the michelson interferometer that be use to conduct the experiment the arm of the interferometer be initially set such that they be approximately the same length and perpendicular this be do by use a magnetic ruler everything be align in the plane of the incident light the sensitivity of the set up mean that poor alignment can lead to a non-horizontal interferogram and large error in the spectium for high wavelength the distance of the light sow-ce and the detector from the beam splitter be not important for a bright focus sow-ce of light like a laser however with ow-tungsten sow-ce which be relatively dim we chose to reduce the beam-splitter to detector distance and put an opaque tube on the path from light sow-ce to beam splitter this be to reduce sti•ay light and increase the intensity on the detector 2.5cm and 10cm convex lens be also use to initially refract and then focus light at the detector dense black foam-cards and a large black box be also use to isolate the detector from any extemal and stray light the automate mittor can ti•avel unidirectionally along the path by command sent from a computer also the detector gain be adjust to a reasonable level such that the detector be not fully satw-ated at maximum light intensity the null point be observe when t 0 m. to detennine the prelimina1y range for the automate mittor in which the null point be locate a green laser be use and an interference pattem be observe by eye green laser because of it more limited number of wavelength have a much large coherence length compare to white light therefore an interference pattem can be observe throughout the maximum range of motion for the automate 1niitor by staiting at one of the end of the maximum range for the mi11'0r and move it towards the other end at 0.001 mm/s we note weather the fringe be travel into or out of the central maximum of the haidinger fringe haidinger fringe be circular to make determine this motion more obvious we adjust the tilt of the fix mit-ror until the centi•al maximum be visible next we move 1mm in the original direction and repeat eventually within a 1 mm range the fringe will move in the opposite direction we continued to nanow down the range until it be unclear to tell which direction the fringe be travel use this method we be able to detennine a 0.5 mm range in which the null point be position next we carefully switch the green laser to a white tungsten source the white light have a significantly small coherence length approximately 2 .23 µm 3 than the green light there be many more wavelength present meaning they can correctly superpose to produce an interference pattem for a very limited distance by move the automate miitor through the narrow range at 0.001 mm/s we can observe an interferogram within a 0.07 mm range a computer be use to collect the reading from the detector for a give position of the automate rnittor the interferograms and the spectmms for white tungsten light be shov 'il in fig 3. there be a noticeable yet abnonnal peak in the spectrum which be on average at 667.09 ± 0.01 nm the average be found by find the peak wavelength of multiple tungsten white light spectmms use eqn 3 the operational temperature of the tungsten filament be found to be 4343.3 ± 312.5 k. the uncertainty in the temperature be determine by consider the propagation of e1rnr from the average peak wavelength the datasheet for the detector sfh 2200 claim the spectral range of sensitivity to be from 300 nm to 1100 nm from our test a more accurate range be from 450 nm to 730 nm this show that the peak a see in the spectrum be false and likely due to the detector 's inability to detect em radiation in the infrared a more computational approach be take to determine the operational temperature of the tungsten filament the valid data from within the correct sensitivity range for the detector be use to cwve fit to planck 's law eqn 2 in python do so allow u to project an approximate spectrum for tungsten and obtain the operational temperatw•e a a parameter the fit and project spectrwn can be see in fig 4. the calculate operational temperature of tungsten be 3550 ± 1100 x 10 5 k. even though the value of the temperature be closer to the expect value the uncertainty be large enough to invalidate this result this tr•eatrnent on other tungsten white light spectrum result in similar result consider fig 4b the uncertainty be quite large due to the natw•e of the cwve fitting and projection the data use for the cwve fit be only a very small section of the potential spectmm which make the behavior of the rest of the spectrwn unclear additionally ow• initial assumption be incorrect could also lead to such a large uncertainty we assume that the tungsten filament emits light a a black body at thermal equilibrium potentially enough time be not give for the tungsten source to reach equilibrium temperatw•e or tungsten may not behave a a black body if the latter be true then the treatment of cwve fitting to planck 's law be invalid however this be unlikely due to the overwhelm amount of research show tungsten filament be a black body radiator other source of en-or we face be minor the stability of the automate mitrnr can be determine by look at the separation in distance between consecutive measurement the standard e1rnr of these separation be ± 1.4044 x 10-s 1lllll at 1 µm/s speed this be relatively ve1y small and such show the motion of the automate miitor to be stable the noise level of the detector be determine to be negligible the reading from the detector when the light source be off be compare to when the light sow•ce be on at a give gain the comparison show the noise level to be insignificant especially when reading be do near the null point give the negligible errnrs in the measw•ements of the detector and motion of the automate mirror the interferogram for light with wavelength in the correct sensitivity range be accw•ate therefore in the correct sensitivity range the spectmm data be valid unfortunately due to the large errnr in the value for the operational temperatw•e the experiment must be deem inconclusive the large errnr be primarily due to the detector s inability to measure significantly outside the visible range for em radiation far experiment need to be conduct with a photodetector with a sensitivity range extend much far into the infrared this will allow for a much more accurate curve fit and low uncertainty in the parameter of the fit ideally a sensitive infrared the1mometer will also be use to verify the temperature of the filament t the path difference for

44,2ndINT_PAO564_Redacted,michelson interferometer can be use to observe interferograms that be produce by different light source a fourier transform of these interferograms can be use to see the spread of wavelength emit by a light source this mean we can observe the intensity of light emit across different wavelength of light emit diode and black body radiator blue lead be observe to have a wavelength of 465±10nm white lead be observe to have a wavelength of 595±50nm a tungsten light source with a yellow filter have a wavelength of 585±18nm and a green filter result in a wavelength of 546±13nm due to the detector be unable to measure in the infrared it be impossible to observe the full black body spectrum of the tungsten light source without filter but the peak wavelength be found to be 856 ±59nm when wave with different phase meet interference between the wave occurs and base on the phase of the individual wave constructive or destructive interference can occur for wave of the same wavelength constructive interference occurs when the path difference between the two wave be a multiple of the wavelength destructive interference occurs when the path difference be an odd multiple of half wavelength we investigate how different light source interfere in a michelson interferometer to produce fringe and how these fringe can help u determine the wavelength of light that the source emits at we use blue and white lead a well a a tungsten lamp with and without filter to observe how the filter light varies from the unfiltered light a michelson interferometer will be set up for this experiment a michelson interferometer consists of a light source point at a beam splitter that separate the light into two perpendicular beam that travel to a mirror and be reflect to the beam splitter where they recombine this recombine light be then sent towards a photodetector which can be use to detect phase change base on the intensity of the signal if the mirror be space the same distance apart then the light travel the same distance both way and should recombine with a phase difference of zero result in constructive interference but the dielectric plate on the beam splitter change the phase of one of the wave result in destructive interference when the distance between the mirror be the same the mirror surface on the end of the interferometer be place perpendicular to the beam of light ensures that haidinger fringe will be present tilt mirror will result in fizeau fringe haidinger fringe occur because the perpendicular mirror create ray of light that travel parallel to each other and appear to come from a source infinitely far away when the mirror be not perpendicular the light recombines and creates fringe that appear to be from a point source close to the mirror for this experiment haidinger fringe be prefer a they will enable u to find the 'null point where the path difference between the two wave be zero a we approach the null point we will begin to observe large change in the photodetector signal this be cause by the fringe and the width of the fringe will depend on the light source light source can be model to be approximately gaussian and this will result in each of the light source have a spectral line base on the light they emit a light source with a narrow spectral line monochromatic light will result in a wider fringe and a wider spectral line such a from a white light source will result in a narrower fringe we can obtain the fringe for each of the light source by move one of the mirror through the null point and then we can convert the fringe back into a gaussian line shape to investigate the light source and the wavelength of light that it emits at once the experimental fringe be obtain we can use fourier transform on them to convert them to show the spectral line and from this we can investigate the wavelength that the light source emit at we use two different type of light source to investigate the fringe pattern create around the null point blue and white lead along be use along with a tungsten lamp and yellow and green filter lead consist of a crystalline material with electron be able to transition between the two layer 2 this transition result in the electron lose energy and a photon with equivalent energy be release two different semiconductor material can be combine to release photon at different wavelength 2 the tungsten lamp consists of a metal be heat and the electron in the metal release energy a they de-excite after be excite due to heating this mean that there be no restriction in the exact wavelength of photon that can be release like with lead so the tungsten lamp will emit like a black-body across all wavelenghts due to it black-body emission we can link temperature to the high internsity wavelength emit through wien 's lawequation 1 investigate property of light source base on interferograms ■ an optical table be require for the whole interferometer to rest on a this greatly reduces the noise that might affect result by reduce the amplitude of any oscillation such a from the shake of the table a stage with a movable rnittor and a fix mirrnr with tilt adjustment will be place at the end of the interferometer and they will be place approximately the same distance apart the whole setup of equipment can be see in figure 1. when the light source be connect to the beam splitter there be a diverge lens place between the beam splitter and the source this spread out the light and a converge lens be place after the beam be recombine to focus it onto the detector after the rnittors be place approximately the same distance apart we attempt to find the null point we use a green laser to view the fringe and align the stationary rnittor to be a close to perpendicular a possible to ensure that we could see haidinger fringe after the alignment we move the stage at a slow pace and note when the fringe be move inwards we then move the stage to a different position and move it towards the previous position if the fringe move inwards in both case that meant the null point be between the two position we then move the stage in between the two initial position and repeat this until both fringe move inwards and the null point be within 0.1mm we the switch to white light to find the exact null point this be because the wider range of wavelength mean that there be a much small fringe and so the null point can be found with high accuracy after obtain the interferograms we use fourier transforms to show the spread of wavelength of the light source single colour light source interferograms span the long across the null point and this be to be expect due to their nan-ow wavelength band the blue lead wavelength spread can be see in figure 2 the blue lead have a very sharp increase in wavelength and have a peak wavelength of 465±10nm the gaussian that be overlaid follow the general shape but it can not be use a good approxirnation for it because lead light ernission be dependent on specific frequency base on the energy release by the photon `` -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- figure 3 the fourier transform for the interferogram collect for the white lead over the null point two gaussians have be fit for each of the peak the first peak be at 465nm and the second gaussian peak be at 605nm figure 3 show the spread of wavelength for the white lead white light consists of all frequency of visible light and so it have a much large spread of wavelength than the blue lead and this be to be expect a single gaussian can not be fit to this fourier transform due to the shape but the mea wavelength could be calculate through the interferogram and be found to be 595±50nm lead be make from semiconductor material which can only ernit at certain frequency so emit white light mean that different semiconductor material be join together and the two peak show the wavelength that each of the semiconductor material emits at the lead ernits blue light at a. peak of 465nm and yellow light a.t 605nm there could be other material emit different light but that can only be conclude if a high resolution interferogram be take it it unlikely that a single material can emit the large range of wavelength show by the second gaussian when filter the light emit by the tungsten light source we see a clear spread of wavelength but there be also a dip that be see in between the spread of wavelength in figure 4. the gaussian do not properly fit the shape of the peak that be see two separate gaussians could be fit but this should not be require a tungsten can be model a a black body and so all wavelength should be present this phenomenon be also present in figure 5 when the filter be change for a green filter the gaussian fit for the green filter be also not suitable a the shape should approximate to a square wave for a certain wavelength range the filter should function to let in a range of wavelength and so all other wavelength should not be allow to pa through we use different filter of the same colour but the sharp drop in intensity remain across all test figure 5 the fourier transform for the tungsten light source with a green filter the peak wavelength be approximate through the gaussian and be determine to be 546±13nm figure 6 the fourier transform for the tungsten light souce with no filter present the peak wavelength be approximate through the gaussian and be determine to be 855±nm when all filter be remove from the tungsten source we obtain a wavelength spread that be much large and peak near the infrared part of the spectrum at 855nm the gaussian that we fit to the curve be n't a good fit even though tungsten emits like a black body this be because the tungsten source should emit light in the range of 360-2600nm a state by the manufacturer the manufacturer also state that the peak wavelength should be 1000nm 1 which be 17 away from the detect wavelength even if we account for the 15k error in the temperature value of 2796k 1 the peak wavelength of 855nm be not within this error this mean that the detector be miss a very large part of the spectrum from the tungsten source the detector likely can not collect data in the infrared region so this mean that our data be incomplete which be why the gaussian be not a good fit by use the peak wavelength we can use equation 1 to calculate the temperature that the tungsten be at use 855nm result in a temperature of 3390k which be 21 off the actual value of 2796k that be state on the light source a michelson interferometer be a valuable tool that can help u analyse different light source and enable u to observe how their spectrum change base on the method they use to produce photon lead emit small photon in a narrow wavelength band and be not suitably described by a gaussian curve black body emitter such a tungsten emit over large wavelength band and they be more suitable to be

wave in the universe 1 the layout of the interferometer we use in the experiment be quite simple and be illustrate in figure 1. beam splitter play a very important role in the interferometer that it split the light into two beam and allows beam to recombine and interfere the main principle of the interferometer be that we can get different pattern of interference by adjust the position of the move miffor to change the phase difference between two beam and use laser white lead tungsten lamp with yellow and green filter a resource the dielectric plate make sure that the phase difference between two beam of light be reduce and equivalent to the path difference then we can easily govern the phase difference between light beam by just adjust the position of the move miitor in this experiment we firstly simulated the interferograms of laser and white lead light and use interferometer to understand the interferograms of different light source then obtain the spectmms by apply fourier transform when two wave travel in the same or opposite direction they will interfere and the amplitude of the new wave be the sum of amplitude of each wave the pattem of the interference depends on the phase difference of two wave figure .2 show the path of two beam in the interferometer ml and m2 be two murnrs where m2 can move t be the distance between miitor-s. the path difference of two beam be ab+bd in the figure and we can simply show that the path difference be 2t co e by consider hence the equation which govems the angle e be 2tcose mil 3 where m be integer and when m be odd dark fringe observe while m be even bright fringe observe from the equation we can see when t and 1 remain constant beam with same incident angle form the correspond number of fringe so the interference pattem should be ring-shaped from the equation3 we can derive the fonnula 2t « sm tsin0o0 4 for the same « sm 60 be small correspond to the large 0 that mean the pattems get denser at the outer of the ring by consider these two we can predict the pattem on the detector should be same a figure3 and the interferogram be just the sinusoidal function interferogram be just a representation of the amplitude change with time and to detennine the spectmms oflight source we need to fourier transfo1m the time domain interferograms to frequency domain spectmm 2 the fourier transfo1m g f of a

beam travel to the move miiror and be reflect the other transmit beam travel to the fix mirror and be reflect back both beam be pa1tially reflect and recombine at the beam splitter two beam be from the same source therefore theii-phases be highly correlate the move stage that use to construct the move miiror be connect to and conti•olled by the computer after the apparatus be set up laser be use a light source to align the interferometer the laser beam create a small spot on the detector which be hard to see hence a lens be inse1t ed betv.•een the laser and the beam splitter to make the spot large we adjust the position height and angle of the fix 1niiror first and make the spot of the laser strike at the centre of the mi11'0r the beam reflect to the move miitor be not concentrate at right angle by consider movmg stage and the beam splitter be fix on the board we put a small piece of paper under the left half of the beam splitter we use a magnetic ruler to ensure all apparatus be in the same height and the fix mi11'0r and the move miitor be perpendicular to each other an interference pattem of dark and bright frmges be see on card board screen and show in figure 8. the pattem see be in line with our expectation show in figure 3 so the inte1ferometer be align because it be quite difficult to align the inte1ferometer and keep the distance from beam splitter to fix/moving mirror we measure these two distance after align the distance from beam splitter to fix miitor be 14.8mm and to move miiror at origin be 14.4mm so our null point should be around -4llllll instead of 0mm the photodetector be instal at the output of the interferometer and connect to pc the photodetector be a photodiode attach to a variable-gain amplifier 4 a the interferometer be align we use white lead to find the null point a mention before the null point should be around the position at -4mm so we choose to record the data from -3 to -5mm figure 9 be the graph obtain and it show that the null point be very close to -4.07mm the first set of data be take by use laser in the range from -4 to 1mm and mittor move at speed 0.0lmm/s the experitnent be repeat by use laser white lead blue lead and tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter with different range and move speed we get the interferogram and spectmm oflaser from our first set of data a figme 10 and 11. the inte1ferogram of laser show a periodic sinusoidal function because it contains only one single frequency with bright and dark fringe altematively the wavelength show in graph be around 265nm but accord to equation 3 the wavelength should be double of that which be 530nm the white lead have already be use to take one set of data so to make it more accurate we record the data in a small range from -4.066 to -4 .076mm with low speed 0.0002mm/s figme 12 and 13 be the interferogram and spectrum respectively of this measurement compare the spectmm in figurel4 that we simulated before the experiment the spectrum we plot from the data be quite accurate the spectrum illustrates that the light source use be warm white lead because the intensity of red light be high than blue light there be a peak at blue light because blue light have a relative high energy from the spectrum we deduce that the mean wavelength of white lead be 620nm and the coherence length be 4um the procedure of use blue lead a light source be quite sitnilar to the white lead and we chose the range from -4 .04 to -4. l mm at move speed 0.000l mm/s figure 15 depicts the interferogram of blue light which be a sitnple beating pattern a it contains a ve1y small range of wavelength from the spectrnm figure 16 we can see the mean wavelength of blue lead be around 490nm which be ve1y close to the theoretical value and the coherence length be 20um for the tungsten source with yellow and green filter the mi1tor move from -4.0 to -4.0 15mm with the speed 0.000 15mm/s the interferograms of tungsten light with yellow and green filter be ve1y similar to each other and highly symmetry show in figure 17 the shape of spectnuns of these two light sow•ces be similar a w ell but with different wavelength due to the colow• of filter be different figure 18 and 19 present the 4 spectrum of tungsten with yellow and green filter respectively accord to the wavelength of yellow light the yellow filter can only pa the light that wavelength

yellow filter the wave in the range from 500-600mm could be so1t out by the green filter so the range of wavelength in the spectrum should be in that range the mean wavelength of green filter be

miirnr ml and m2 be not absolute parallel to each other so there may be a very small angle between them the detector be also very easy to be affected also the fix min-or and the move mirror not perpendicular to each other may cause the uncertainty a well during the experiment we found that a very soft knock on table and cough can cause the amplitude in the interferogram change dramatically this experiment be design to investigate the principle of michelson interferometer analyze the property of the interferograms and spectrum of interference with laser white lead blue lead tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter a light source and also find their mean wavelength and spectral width respectively the interferometer be simply split the light emit from the source by beam splitter and use mirror to reflect these two beam to make them interfere when they back to the beam splitter by change the position of the move mirror the interference pattern will change and the interferogram can be obtain the result of the experiment nearly fit our expectation and the simulation before take the data the interferograms and spectrum of each light source we get be also similar to the theoretical

62,2ndINT_BOD369_Redacted,a michelson interferometer be use to perform fourier-transform spectroscopy ft on three separate light source -a white lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapour lamp -in order to analyse their spectrum and therefore discern the manner in which they emit the source be expect to emit light via different physical process and be purposefully chosen a such to demonstrate both the versatility of ft and different spectrum form via different form of luminescence t he michelson interferometer fig 1 have provide success in help to discern the nature of electromagnetic wave most famously by the negative result of the michelson-morley experiment 1887 to suggest the non-existence of the luminiferous ether in this series of experiment we use a michelson interferometer a a fourier transform spectrometer in order to analyse the property of three light source a white lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapour lamp this technique involves measure the total intensity i λ of the interference pattern produce by a light source at a single point a a function of the path difference λ between it can be show that the transform pair of i λ be i k where k 1 λ be the wave number and λ be the wavelength of light be detect 1 the exact form of i λ be likely to be too complex to be transform by hand therefore this must generally be do computationally an interferometer induces an interference pattern so that the characteristic of source emission may be analyse however this pattern be effect by both path difference a well a the coherence of the interfere light path difference effect how the split wave will superpose when recombine this be most straight forward for monochromatic light where the amplitude detect a λ be related to the path difference λ between the split beam by where a be half the amplitude of the source beam in this case 1 spatial and temporal coherence of a source will effect how emission interfere temporal coherence be a measure of the correlation of a wave 's phase at different point along the direction of propagation that be how the emission from the source varies in time fig 2a a temporally incoherent source will never cause an interference pattern a the phase shift a function of time of the split wave will differ and the pattern will alter too quickly to be detectable 1 note however that a partially temporally coherent source will still produce discernible fringe when the path difference of the split beam be small spatial coherence be a measure of the correlation of a wave 's phase at different point perpendicular to the direction of propagation that be how the source emission varies across a wave-front fig 2b 2 a all the source use be extend they be all therefore spatially incoherent in this paper the coherence length shall be define a for approximately gaussian distribution where ∆λ be the twice the standard deviation of the gaussian and λ be it peak wavelength 3 this represent the range centre on the point of zero path difference which shall be refer to a the null point within which fringe will be easily detectable for example a broad spectrum with large ∆λ will produce a very narrow region within which fringe exist the interferometer be set up a in fig 1 where the mirror be position to be approximately the same distance 15cm from the beam splitter accuracy in position be not necessary a all path difference be to be control by the movable mirror therefore so long a a large enough range centre on the midpoint exist data could be take effectively a 100mm focal length lens be fix to the beam splitter entrance to focus the beam during splitting and reflection this be do so a to reduce the loss in luminosity of the beam due to dispersion before recombination a 25.4mm focal length lens be attach to the splitter exit to spread out the fringe so they could be more easily distinguish by the detector within the housing of the interferometer the photodetector use be an osram sfh 2200 photodiode set to have a sample rate of 50hz 4 the effective range of detection can be see in fig 3. a 532nm laser be use to calibrate the mirror a any interference pattern would be easily see and should exist for a large range of path difference due to the laser 's large coherence length it can be show that fringe separation increase a the interfere beam become more parallel a such the mirror fig 3. effectiveness of detector across a range of wavelength 4 be adjust until a set of haidinger fringe be see to be centre on the detector a this would maximise contrast between fringe 9 10 a region contain the null point be found by observe the region within which the central fringe be the only one visible a the interfere beam simply superpose to form the source beam and thus produce no interference pattern once a sufficiently small range be found the laser be replace by a blue lead and a measurement take across that range to find the null point more easily this be do a ∆λ for the lead be much small than that of the laser and a such the region in which fringe could be detect would be localise to a small region surround the null point it be found to be 7.24 ± 0.001mm from the zero point on the move mirror a far measurement be take with no light source active in order to establish the level of background noise with reading found to be ∼ 100 time dimmer than the mercury lamp and ∼ 10000 time dimmer than the lead and tungsten lamp the first source under consideration be a white lead in order to achieve a broad spectrum in the visible a violet lead be commonly use to stimulate a phosphor layer to produce a spectrum similar to that in fig 4a white light can also be produce through the combination of red green and blue light from three separate lead produce a spectrum similar to that of fig 4b fringe produce by the rgb lead should noticeably beat due to the superposition of three distinct wavelength of similar amplitude where a the `` warm `` lead would likely lack this quality the second source be that of an incandescent tungsten lamp heat to around 2800k under these condition tungsten should act a a black body radiator produce a spectrum like that in fig 5. when the effective detector range be take into account the spectrum should drop off very rapidly beyond 950nm produce a spectrum of coherence length very similar to that of the detector sensitivity ∼ 1µm the third source be a mercury vapour lamp this work by excite the electron in mercury vapour to emit light upon move to a low energy from this excite state heisenberg 's uncertainty principle can be use to relate the lifetime of an excite state with the uncertainty of it energy a short lifetime will have a large energy uncertainty and thus a large ∆λ 8 in this way the coherence length of an emission will be determine by the stability of the excite state of interest line of note within the effective range of the detector should be those of 403 435 546 578 and 1012. v. data analysis the white lead be fit and measurement take across a 0.35mm interval centre on the position of the null point see fig 7 and the spectrum compute with fit gaussian distribution overlaid onto the peak see fig 8. the fringe appear to display no beating far the spectrum show a broad peak in the visible with a small peak in the violet imply that the source be more similar to the `` warm `` lead however a certain level of asymmetry about the maximum be present which remains unexplained the total coherence length be calculate to be 6.07µm to 3 significant figure the tungsten filament lamp be then use a a light source this produce light via incandescence and a such the emission spectrum should have a similar form to that of a black body spectrum fig 5. however likely due to the detector 's effective range the spectrum peak at 806 nm and then rapidly decline to zero after around 900nm the fringe themselves can be see in fig 9 and exist over a very small interval ∼ 10 −6 metre which be to be expect for a source of coherence length calculate to be 1.68µm to 3 significant figure this be on the same order a our estimate base off of the detector range far support that this be the limit factor fig 8. spectrum derive from take fourier transform of data in fig 7. this spectrum be extremely similar in form to that of the `` warm `` lead in fig 3a imply that the lead be of similar construction the mercury source be far dimmer than any other source use and a warm up period be require to allow all the mercury to vaporise the spectrum fig 12 display a number of distinct peak however too much noise exists within the information in order to accurately fit a set of gaussian function mapping to the position of the peak a such the coherence length of the source can not be effectively calculate use this data however the nature of the fringe measure in fig 11 would imply that the total distance across which the fringe be visible be great than the 2mm range which be measure thus the coherence length be likely great than 2mm furthermore the narrowness of peak see in fig 12 would imply that the excite state of interest have a relatively long lifetime and so the state of interest be quite stable however in order to produce an accurate estimate measurement would be need across the whole of the interference pattern the two high peak occur around those predict in fig 5 however a third primary peak occurs at an unpredicted wavelength of approximately 510nm possibly imply that there be some contaminant element in the lamp a small amount of argon be commonly use a a medium in lamp of this kind however this emission line be not typical of argon or mercury imply that some other element be likely present 11 moreover there be an unexpected peak at 1072nm however in fig 6 a broader peak can be see this be more similar to that of a black body spectrum likely cause by the internal heating within the lamp which may serve a an explanation it can be see in fig 11 that the maximum be not centre on the expect location of the null point 7.24 ± 0.001mm this be likely a for small wavelength error in set up become more prominent a the resultant path difference correspond to large phase difference eq 1. vi conclusion three different type of light source be analyse use ft a white lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapour lamp all of which be partially temporally incoherent a well a be spatially incoherent it be found that the white lead produce a spectrum fig 8 more similar to that of a phosphor base `` warm `` white lead fig 4a than that of a lead make up of separate red green and blue lead fig 4b produce the spectrum in fig 8 with a coherence length of 6.07µm to 3 significant figure the tungsten filament lamp be expect to have a the spectrum of a black body at 2800k fig 5 however likely due to the effective range of the detector fig 3 this spectrum rapidly decline shortly after 900nm peak at 806nm with a coherence length calculate to be 1.68µm to 3 significant figure by comparison we can then say that the lead be a more coherent source than then tungsten lamp the mercury source produce a spectrum fig 12 with a distinct set of peak although the data be not stable enough to effectively produce a gaussian describe the nature of the emission line a a result a coherence length could not be calculate however it magnitude could be expect to be great than 2mm a the full set of fringe do not appear to be present in fig 11. a notable peak be situate at 511nm which do not exist in the expect mercury emission spectrum nor in the spectrum of argon a common medium in lamp of this kind this implies that there be likely some other contaminant present in the lamp emit there be also another unexpected peak at 1072nm which may be cause by black body radiation from heating in the lamp in order to verify any of these hypothesis however measurement must be take across the entirety of the mercury lamp

29,2ndINT_HDP206_Redacted,michelson interferometer be use a a spectrometer to obtain spectrum for a white lead tungsten light source and mercury lamp the spectrum for a white lead have one narrow short wavelength peak at 500 ± 16 nm a broad yellow light distribution peak at 629 ± 65 nm the shape of the spectrum resemble the nature of the white lead but the peak be shift towards high wavelength for the tungsten light source the spectrometer capture a range of the expect spectrum but the result be limited by the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode the mercury lamp spectrum capture the region of high intensity but a the frequency fluctuates substantially it fail to capture the expect narrow well define spectral line finally a separation of 2.099 ± 0.014 nm for the yellow doublet of mercury be found from the interferogram of the mercury lamp with a yellow filter the experiment be subject to systematical error where the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode and the fluctuation of the stage movement of the movable mirror affected the result i n the michelson interferometer an incident beam of light be split into two part that be recombine after travel different optical path the optical path difference produce an interference pattern that can be use to perform precision measurement the first interferometer be invent in 1881 by albert michelson and be use in the famous michelson-morley experiment unsuccessfully prove the existence of the `` aether `` 1 despite it age and simple design it be one of the most accurate apparatus design by mankind this be demonstrate through it use in the gravitational wave observatory ligo capable of measure length variation on the order of 10 −21 2 in this experiment the michelson interferometer be adapt to a spectrometer capable of determine the characteristic spectrum of different light source specifically the experiment aim to investigate the physical process govern the white light produce by a lead a tungsten light source and a mercury lamp the layout of the michelson interferometer use in the experiment be show in figure 1. an incident light beam from the source fall on a partially-silvered surface where roughly half of the incident light amplitude be transmit to mirror m2 while the reflect light beam fall on the movable mirror m1 upon return to the beam splitrer the beam undergo partial reflection and recombination where the resultant beam be direct towards a photodiode that measure the interference pattern monochromatic plane wave with wavelength λ be emit from the source upon recombination at the beam splitter the beam interfere the interference be determine by the path difference of the beam the dielectric plate on the transmit beam induces a phase change of λ/2 for the transmit beam such that the interference pattern have dark fringe at optical path difference of integer value of λ. when m1 be move a distance t λ/2 the total path difference change by λ and each fringe move one position relative to the adjacent fringe consequently by counting the number of fringe m a the mirror be move displacement accurate to a fraction of a wavelength can be measure for plane wave the order of interference be govern by the equation 2t mλ 1 in order to use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer one of the mirror must be move to vary the path difference when the path difference be change steadily the intensity of the fringe interferogram at the detector change sinusoidally the period depends on the rate at which the path-difference be change and the wavelength λ of the light source the interferogram be related to the correspond spectrum by the fourier transform the relationship between the fourier transform interferogram and the correspond spectrum also extends to polychromatic light this be due to the non-dispersive property of air such that each frequency from the source be transmit separately a a consequence the spectrum of the light source be the sum of all the fourier transform interferograms for more complicate light source with several wavelength present the interferogram be take at the null point this be the point of zero path difference i.e d1 d2 and have the unique feature of all the different fringe pattern of each frequency component be in phase thus all the frequency component will be at their point of maximum interference and no information be lose another useful feature of the interferogram be it ability to determine the separation of two wavelength through the beating phenomenon consider light of two wavelength λ 1 λ 2 the intensity of the interferogram will be at a maximum when the pattern from one be exactly in phase with the pattern from the other by substitute with equation 1 and assume the separation be small the separation can be found from the change in path length t where λ be the average wavelength between the two wavelength from symmetry the point of minimum intensity have an equal separation with the michelson interferometer set up accord to the diagram in figure 1 interferograms for blue and white lead a tungsten light source and a mercury lamp be gather for the mercury lamp green and yellow filter be use to isolate the green spectral line and the yellow doublet the data for the position of the movable mirror and amplitude of the photodiode be collect at a sample rate of 50 hz with the stage speed set to 0.002mm/s to avoid aliasing data be collect in the range of ± 0.2 mm about the null point yield 10000 data point since the interferogram take consists of discrete data point the application of discrete fourier transform be require more specifically the experiment use fast fourier transform fft a this be more computational efficient for large datasets a the light source have polychromatic spectrum the data be collect around the null point to locate the null point a green laser be use to determine the range in which the direction of fringe emerge change consequently the interferogram of a white lead be use to locate the point of maximum amplitude and hence the null point to a accuracy of ±0.01 mm all the measure amplitude have be re-scaled such that their maximum be at 100 to allow comparison of the spectrum a light emit diode lead be a semiconductor light source emit light due to electron recombination with electron hole in the semiconducting material this release energy in the form of photon by vary the electron band gap in the semiconductor the energy of the photon and thus the wavelength can be control the white lead use in this experiment produce white light through the combination of a blue wavelength lead with a phosphor coat the phosphor coat produce a broad yellow light that combine with the blue to create a spectrum we perceive a white light fig 2 spectrum create from a fft of the interferogram of the white and blue lead a gaussion be fit to estimate the mean wavelength and the standard deviation in figure 2 the measure spectrum of a white lead be show in grey by fitting two gaussian distribution the first peak have a mean wavelength of 500 ± 16 nm while the second peak 629 ± 65 nm in comparison with the typical spectrum of a white lead a show in figure 8 in the appendix the wavelength seem to be red-shifted this be also the case for the blue lead show in blue in figure 2 with a mean wavelength of 512 ± 14 nm compare to an expect wavelength 470 ± 5 nm it be therefore likely that there be a systematic error shift the wavelength value despite this the shape of the distribution still agrees with the physical process of a white lead a there be a narrow peak at short wavelength and a broader distribution of yellow light however the amplitude of the short wavelength be expect to be significantly high than the amplitude of the yellow light a the short wavelength be the source of the yellow light emit from the phosphor this be likely due to the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode use in the experiment from figure 7 in the appendix the photodiode be approximately twice a sensitive for yellow light a for blue light this explains the discrepancy of the amplitude a a tungsten white light source be an incandescent source it can be approximate a a black body thus the temperature of the black body can be calculate from wien 's displacement law in figure 3 the measure spectrum of the tungsten light source be plot in blue peak at 868 ± 4 nm and thus have a black body temperature of 3334 ± 15 k where the error be estimate from the resolution around the peak wavelength the spectrum do not appear to follow the maxwell-boltzmann distribution expect from a black body light source in figure 9 in the appendix the manufacturer 's measure spectral distribution be show unlike this experiment measure spectrum the spectrum behaves like a black body with a temperature of 2796 k. the orange line represent the product of the measure spectrum and the photodiode 's spectral sensitivity the data for the sensitivity be adopt from 6 where the value be extrapolate to an exponential decay below 400 nm and above 1100 nm again this discrepancy be likely to be cause by the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode a it be incapable of measure wavelength above 1100 nm whereas the tungsten light source emits light up to 2800 nm a the photodiode effectively behaves like a wavelength filter the measure signal be a convolution of the tungsten spectrum and the sensitivity of the photodiode a the spectrum be a fft convolution be equal to multiplication in frequency domain 4 in figure 3 the product of the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode and the manufacturer 's tungsten spectrum be show in orange this agrees with the measure spectrum and thus provide strong evidence to support the origin of the discrepancy mercury lamp produce light through the action of high pressure mercury vapour that ionises and be excite to high energy state a a current be pas through the vapour a the mercury undergoes atomic transition photon with an energy equal to the difference of the state be emit a a consequence the light spectrum consists of narrow spectral line of well define wavelength the most prominent spectral line be at wavelength 404.6 nm 435.8 nm 546.0 nm green and the yellow doublet 576.9 nm and 579.0 nm 9 the measure spectrum in figure 4 capture the region of high intensity a show in the reference mercury spectrum in figure 10 in the appendix with the high peak again red-shifted at 559 ± 4 nm and 593 ± 10 nm however the spectrum be not able to capture the distinct narrow spectral line expect for a mercury lamp the inaccuracy and noisy data in the ffts be likely to be cause by the variation of the stage movement a illustrate in figure 11 in the appendix the stage speed between data point can fluctuate up to 75 but still average to the set value of 0.002 mm/s to far study the green spectral line at 546.0 nm and the yellow doublet the measurement be record with bandpass filter a show in figure 5 where the filter transmission profile also be plot the fact that the spectrum have wavelength far outside the transmission bandwidth of both the filter individually far demonstrates the inaccuracy of the ffts the peak amplitude of the spectrum be shift about 13 nm compare to the accepted value of mercury spectral line which far illustrates the systematical error in the experiment to determine the separation of the yellow doublet an interferogram be obtain a show in figure 6. a expect the beating phenomenon be observe where the node have nonzero amplitude indicate background light or a difference in amplitude of the two wavelength by take the average node separation over four period the change in position t between node be found to be 0.0795 mm combine with the mean wavelength of the accepted value of the yellow doublet of λ 578.012 nm equation 2 yield a separation of 2.099±0.014 nm which be only a 0.33 deviation from the accepted value of 2.106 nm here the error have be estimate from the uncertainty of the position of the node down to one fringe the accuracy of this measurement demonstrates the interferometer accuracy when work with the interferogram through measurement of various light source there appear to be a systematical error in the spectrum obtain from take a fft of the interferogram a the mean wavelength value be shift from the reference level a the interferogram be able to determine the separation of the yellow mercury doublet to an uncertainty of 0.67 there be strong reason to believe that the error arises when take the fft a possible explanation could be the variation of the stage 's movement which be found to fluctuate significantly and thus can affect the result of the fft in addition the photodiode can detect background light from the surroundings and light from the source that have not travel through the interferometer the alignment of the setup be critical to observe an interference pattern but can not explain the shift in wavelength the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode also affected the result a it measure nonphysical amplitude difference and fail to cover the whole spectrum furthermore there be error introduce by the component such a the flatness of the mirror and imperfect lens a well a environmental error such a index change cause by variation in temperature pressure and humidity in this experiment a michelson interferometer be use a a spectrometer record the interference pattern over a range of position and take a fft of the interferogram to obtain the spectrum the spectrometer be use to obtain spectrum for different white light source a white solid state lead an incandescent tungsten light source and a mercury lamp that emits light through atomic transition the spectrum for a white lead have two peak a expect one narrow short wavelength peak at 500 ± 16 nm from the lead and a broad yellow light distribution peak at 629±65 nm from the phosphor coat however the peak be redshifted relative to the manufacturer 's datasheet a there be a systematic error in the experiment for the tungsten light source the spectrometer capture a range of the expect spectrum limited by the spectral sensitivity of the photodiode a a result the measure spectrum resemble a gaussian like distribution while expect to be maxwell-boltzmann distribution for a black body light source the mercury lamp spectrum capture the region of high intensity with peak in proximity to the expect wavelength however the frequency fluctuates substantially and fails to capture the narrow well define spectral line from the atomic transition in the mercury lamp furthermore the spectrum of the light that pas through green and yellow bandpass filter reside outside the transmission bandpass of the filter again show that there be a systematic error in the spectrometer finally the separation of the yellow doublet of mercury be found from the interferogram of the mercury lamp with a yellow filter the separation be found to be 2.099±0.014 nm which have a percentage error of only 0.33 compare to the accepted value this demonstrates the setup accuracy a an interferometer and suggests that the systematic error stem from the spectrum obtain from the fft in conclusion this experiment show the feasibility of use the michelson interferometer a an spectrometer a feature of various light source can be distinguish from the spectrum the experiment could be far improve through the addition of a photodiode capable of measure the whole spectrum of the light source in addition a more accurate movable mirror would increase the accuracy of the spectrum obtain from the ffts fig 7 the relative spectral sensitivity of the photodiode a quote in the manufaturer 's datasheet the high variance of

pattern detect could be use to retrieve the spectrum of the source michelson construct an analogue computer to carry out the fourier transforms need this technique have since proliferate due to the advent of fast and inexpensive computer 2 the aim of the experiment present be to use a michelson interferometer to study the spectrum of different light source describe them both qualitatively and quantitatively the first source consider be lead lamp that produce light use a light-emitting diode and be significantly more efficient than incandescent and fluorescent lamp we then study an incandescent tungsten lamp to which optical filter be apply in this report the main spectral difference between the two type of source will be outline a well a the effect that different filter have on the light spectrum interference consists in the superposition of two or more wave from the same source that be incident on the same point the interference be perfectly constructive when the wave be in phase which in the absence of a phase shift corresponds to their path difference be an integer multiple of their wavelength 3 a measure of the maximum path difference the two light beam can have before the interference pattern fade be give by the coherence length l that can be found use where c be the speed of light in a vacuum and δν be the bandwidth of the source 3 in a michelson interferometer the light beam emit by a source be amplitude-divided at the beam-splitter into two beam one reflect and one transmit a show in fig 1. the beam then travel to two mutually perpendicular mirror m1 and m2 in fig 1 and be reflect when the two light wave recombine at the beam-splitter they interfere in different way depend on the difference in the distance travel by the two ray the intensity of the light that reach the detector therefore depends on the path difference l and can be write a where a be the amplitude of the beam and σ1 their wavenumber 4 spectral analysis of lead and tungsten halogen lamp light use a michelson interferometer in the case of an extend source i.e not point-like light beam enter the system from numerous different angle result in an interference pattern characterise by concentric bright ring these fringe be call haidinger fringe and be show in fig 2. the interference pattern change a one of the mirror be translate a it cause the path difference l to change when l be be decrease the fringe shrink towards the centre of the interference pattern and conversely they spread out from the centre when l be be increase the record of this vary signal at the detector be call an interferogram the midpoint of the interferogram refer to a the null point corresponds to a path difference equal to zero 4 the vary intensity of the detect light can be express a a function of the spectral amplitude distribution of the source b σ by rewrite eq 2 in the form we can then split eq n into the two integral the first of which corresponds to a constant equal to half the intensity obtain with optically equidistant mirror therefore we have which be a cosine fourier transform of b σ i.e the real part of the full transform we can now calculate the spectrum of the source b σ a a function of the detect intensity use the inverse fourier transform the frequency composition of the source can therefore be retrieve from the interferogram with the use of fourier transforms 4 a the envelope of an interferogram follow a gaussian shape it be important to note that the fourier transform of a gaussian curve be still a gaussian curve the result gaussian have width inversely proportional to the width of the original one this proportionality be sometimes call the bandwidth theorem 5 for this experiment we use three different source a blue lead a white lead and a halogen tungsten lamp we take measurement of the tungsten light both unfiltered and filter the two filter use be a green filter and a yellow one with central wavelength give to be respectively 543.5 nm and 580 nm by the manufacturer both value have an uncertainty of 2 nm the setup of the michelson interferometer use be show in fig 1. to correctly align the component we use a green laser firstly we make sure that the mirror be perpendicular to the incoming light beam by check that the ray be be reflect back to the same point where they left the beam splitter secondly we make sure that the output ray reach the detector be overlap to achieve this we adjust the direction of two beam until they appear to overlap on a distant object we then add a plano-convex lens f 25.4mm to the source to observe the interference pattern to find the null point we decide to move the stage by 1 mm step and then scan very slowly over a small distance this allow u to determine if the fringe of the interference pattern be move inwards or outwards by refining our step we found the point where the direction of the fringe change that corresponds to the null point we then use a white lead light to find the null point more precisely a it have a broader emission spectrum and therefore a narrower interferogram in accordance with the bandwidth theorem we scan slowly over small interval around the null point 's approximate position found with the green laser until we observe a dark fringe on the detector correspond to the null point we proceed to take preliminary data in order to adjust the move mirror 's speed and the gain of the detector we then take data around the null point for each of the source adjust the range base on the size of the interferogram and with a sample rate of 50hz we found that the null point corresponds to a dark fringe not a bright one the interference with zero path difference be perfectly destructive a the beam splitter introduces a phase change of 90⁰ we observe that for the first 10-20 data point the position step record be not regular furthermore numerous data point be take at the final position after the stage have stop move for these reason we decide to crop our data to avoid shift in the wavelength spectrum to retrieve the wavelength spectrum from the interferograms we perform a fast fourier transform on the data set the step of the move mirror to be constant and equal to the average length of the measure step all the uncertainty report be obtain from the uncertainty on the fit or calculate use the standard formula 6 the wavelength specf lum obtain for the blue lead show in fig 3 be characterise by one single peak with mean wavelength equal to 455.3±0 in the case of a white lead show in fig 4 the spectmm present t\¥ 0 different peak a large one with wavelength range from yellow to red and a small one coitesponding to blue light this result agrees with what expect a the most common way of produce white lead consists in coat a blue or uv lead with a thin layer of phosphor that cause yellow light to be emit the combination of the blue and yellow light appear white to the human eye the thickness of the phosphor layer determines the colour temperature of the lamp 8 in our case the yellow-red component be predominant on the blue one result a warm white colour most of the white lead spectmm be within the visible range therefore only a small part of the energy supply to the source get conve1t ed in non-visible light make the white lead relatively efficient a a illumination source the wavelength spectrum obtain for filter and unfiltered tungsten lamp be show in fig 5. a expect the amplitude be reduce when filter be apply fig 5 not to scale the mean wavelength of the unfiltered light found in table l be shift when filter be apply the shift value for wavelength table l be compatible with expect range of 560-590 run for yellow light and 520-560 run for green light 7 the filter light specn•a be characterise by an in•egular shape which impact negatively on their fit and consequently on the value of spectral width and bandwidth obtain the unfiltered specf lum be well approximate by a gaussian wavelength nm fig 5. plot of tungsten light both unfiltered and filter use green and yellow optical filter ti1e dash line represent the gaussian fit spectrum the amplitude obtain with filter light be amplify by a factor of 30 to be visible in the same graph a the unfiltered light tue fit on the filter light data be very poor while the fit on the unfiltered light data follow the data reasonably well most of the specf lum for unfiltered tungsten light fall outside of the visible range this detennines a low efficiency a an illumination source we approximate the tungsten lamp to a blackbody and estimate it temperature to be 3500k by use wien 's displacement law tapea1 2.898•10-3 where t be the temperature this value be an overestimation on the expect value of around 3000k 9 suggest that the mean wavelength we calculate be likely to be inferior to the actual value 1 be compatible with the interferograms a they be of the same order of magnitude in the case of the white lead the coherence length be found consider the main peak only the coherence length value obtain for the filter light found in table 1 be not compatible with the coitesponding interferograms show in fig 6. these value should in fact be of the order of ioµm the en-or arises from the spectral width of the filter light obtain which be approximately ten time large than the value give by the manufacturer fwhm of i o run this discrepancy be mainly due to the fact wavelength data for filter light be poorly fit which result in a significant overestimation of the standard deviation and therefore of the spectral width and the bandwidth .. by compare the interferograms fig 6 and sub lot of fig 3 and 4 and the coitesponding spectrum it can be observe that wider interferograms coitespond to nrurnwer spectrum and viceversa a predict by the bandwidth theorem in this experiment we retrieve the spectrum of different light source by perfonning a fow'ier transfonn on their interferograms which we obtain with a michelson interferometer the source use be a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten halogen light the latter be employ both unfiltered and filter with green and yellow optical filter we determine that the lead sow•ces have naitower spectrum compru•ed to the unfiltered tungsten lamp and that these prevalently occupy the visible range for this reason we conclude that the lead study be more efficient illlllllination source than the incandescent tungsten light which spectium fall mostly outside of the visible range we found the mean wavelength of the blue lead 455 .3±0.3 run to be in wavelength interval of blue light a expect in the case of the white lead we found that two peak ru•e present a small one coitesponding to blue light and a main one in the range from yellow to red light this combination of t\¥ 0 frequency be perceive a white by the human eye we found that filte1'ing the tungsten light cause it spectruni to naitow and decrease in runplitude the specti•a of the filter tungsten light appear iitegular and much broader than what expect from the data provide by the manufacturer we be unable to properly fit these spectrum result in an incoitect calculation of the bandwidth and therefore of the coherence length of the filter light finally we approximate the tungsten lamp to a blackbody which allow u to determine that the mean wavelength value found 827.2±2.0 nm be likely to be an underestimate this expe1'iment could be improve by develop a more accurate way of processing the filter spectrum and by include in the eitor analysis the contribution of the fast fow•ier transform perform a described for example in an accurate e1ror analysis model f or fast fowier transform 10,deep,exp,70,0.26015082,0.73984915
53,2ndINT_CCY232_Redacted,the theory behind the analysis for the interferograms be relatively simple to understand the spectral line qualitatively the mean wavelength and spectral width could be explore mean wavelength of a light source can be found by assume constant distance between sample find the difference in position between peak in the interferogram give the amount the stage be move by between these point this mean the path difference in light be twice that amount a light travel to and from the mirror hence the wavelength be double the distance between peak spectral width calculation require an assumption of a gaussian distribution the full width at half maximum 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 can be found from the interferogram and from this the standard deviation 𝜎 can be found use here the standard deviation act a the coherence length of the source therefore the spectral width ∆𝑣 can be found from where 𝑐 be the speed of light in a vacuum this can be turn into a wavelength width ∆𝜆 use light-emitting diode lead be small robust and efficient light source they work on the principle that when a voltage be apply across it electron recombine with electron hole inside the lead this release energy in the form of photon where the wavelength of the photon release correlate to the physical characteristic of the device 3 there be two conventional method for create white light in lead firstly the rgb method combine red green and blue lead to create white light secondly the phosphor method combine a short wavelength lead such a blue or uv with a yellow phosphor coat some of the short wavelength photo be convert to yellow photon and these combine to create white light the interferometer be built follow the general schematic show in figure 1. the mirror be situate approximately 16cm from the beam splitter a see in figure 2. a green laser be use a the light source and a temporary black screen be insert in front of the detector to align the apparatus successfully the angle of the tilt mirror be adjust until the laser dot from both path be overlap the move mirror set on a motor stage be move to it zero point a the basis of alignment a broadening lens be use to expand the beam and allow the fringe to be see well the lens be insert before the beam splitter because if it be insert after then any error in misalignment would be magnify by the lens fringe from the green laser be see on the black card in order to find the null point the stage be move in increment of 1mm between the full range of -10mm and 10mm the number of fringe be count for each position and it be found that the number decrease and increase around the null point the range of the null point be establish to be between -2 and 0. the laser be replace with a white lead and data be take between this range at first the stage be move at a speed of 0.0002 mm/s however the result data be very irregular this be because the stage do not move continuously so multiple measurement be take at each position additionally the stage be not perfect and vibrate slightly between movement the speed be increase to 0.001 mm/s and improve data be take the asymmetry be cause by the lack of precision in the set up if all component be at exact right angle to one another there would be no angular vary path difference and the interference would be more symmetric therefore ground glass be insert in front of the white lead to disperse the light which in turn minimises any error in misalignment another set of data be take despite the add dispersion measure the data be still relatively skewed when re-observing the set up it be found that the white lead be rest against the ground glass create an unwanted reflection effect the lead be reposition and a new data set be take here the symmetry be clearly improve however the data take be once again very irregular repeat data point be take at the same position rather than at regular interval to explore this far a histogram of the frequency of distance move by the mirror on the motor stage be take for the above data set very often the distance move be almost 0. this suggests that the speed of the motor be set erroneously to compare the stage movement histogram be plot for the second data set and a regular distribution around 20nm be found a expect by the specification of the instrument therefore for analysis the more regular albeit asymmetric data set be to be use a the asymmetry do n't play too important a role in determine the spectral distribution additionally the white light interference pattern be observe by eye and it be found that the colour spectrum be mirror around the null point this be due to the vary wavelength of visible lightsince blue have a small wavelength than red the interference pattern go red to blue a it approach the null point and then blue to red a it recedes from it the null point be a dark fringe due to the dielectric plate on the beam splitter use the same method of a mount lead in front of ground glass an interferogram be take for the blue lead a well the interferogram be see to be very regular and symmetrical apart from a deviation on the left of the null point this could have be cause by several physical factor notably a disturbance to the equipment such a a knock against the desk or some 'zero distance stage movement rather than the desire 20nm a explore earlier the mean wavelength be measure from the interferograms of the white lead and the blue lead to avoid the deviation in the data the distance be calculate over 10 peak at a time divide and then average since the distance between sample be not truly constant an error in wavelength be derive from this it can be see from figure 6b that the vast majority of distance move by the stage be between 0 and 40nm hence the error be chosen to be ±20nm finally the mean wavelength of the white and blue lead be found to be 500±20 ×10 -9 m and 480±20 ×10 -9 m. the spectral width be measure from the interferometer for both lead a outline in the theory section the spectral width of the blue lead be found to be 29±7 ×10 -9 m. the error be derive from the lack of precision in interpolate the full width at half maximumthe width have to be measure between discrete wave peak on the interferogram similarly the spectral width for the white lead be found to be 90±20 ×10 -9 m. this be much wider than the blue lead demonstrate that white lead be form of more frequency than blue fourier transforms be also take and be show below the peak wavelength from the fourier distribution for the white lead be found to be 470±20 ×10 -9 m and 610±20 ×10 -9 m left and right peak respectively where the error be carry through from the stage inaccuracy average this the mean wavelength be found to be 540±30 ×10 -9 m where the error be add in quadrature this differs from the previous value however the error overlap so the difference most likely arises from the inaccuracy of the method for the blue lead it be found to be 480±20 ×10 -9 m. this correlate perfectly with the wavelength found by average the interferogram distance suggest that the method work best for regular distribution such a the blue interferogram from the fourier transform it be see that the white lead spectrum be much broader than the blue spectrum due to the many wavelength that constitutes it this validates the inverse relationship a mention in the theory section the blue lead have a sharp and narrow peak at the appropriate wavelength for blue light whilst the white lead be compose of a more indigo tint blue and orange a extrapolate from the visible light spectrum diagram below wavelength distribution of visible spectrum wavelength obtain from analysis correlate well with the visible colour produce by lead 5 this indicates that the white lead be of the phosphor type rather than the rgb a there be no green spectrum to be see in the fourier transform the main aim of the project be to build a michelson interferometer and to use it to explore the interference and spectral distribution of light interferograms of a white and blue lead be take and analysis be complete to find it 's comprise wavelength a expect the blue lead have a mean wavelength of 480±20 ×10 -9 m and have a sharp narrow spectral line with a short spectral width this contrast with the much broader spectral line for the white lead which be comprise of wavelength in the blue and orange region of the visible spectrum at 470±20 ×10 -9 m and 610±20 ×10 -9 m respectively furthermore this suggest the white lead to be of the phosphor typea method of

43,2ndINT_LXZ649_Redacted,interferograms be take use a michelson interferometer use various source include an lead white light a blue lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury lamp fourier analysis be apply on the interferograms to yield the spectral characteristic of each source and these be compare and explain with the physic of each source t he goal of this experiment be to observe the spectral characteristic of various source and compare them use the physic involve in each source fourier transform spectroscopy be a less direct method of spectroscopy than for example use a monochromator or grate however can have a high signal to noise ratio than these simpler technique provide the main source of noise be not shot-noise this be know a felgett 's advantage 2 the first component of our fourier transform spectroscopy be the michelson interferometer be first use in 1887 for the famous michelson-morley experiment 1 which fail to detect luminiferous aether wind the second component be the fourier transform which be use to transition from path length space into wavelength space t he michelson inferometer consists of a ray from a light source travel to a beam splitter where it be sent to two different mirror at distance d 1 and d 2 from the beam splitter respectively the light reflect of each mirror and recombines before be receive by the photodetector a diagram be show in figure 1. crucially we can vary d 1 use a stepper motor by take the difference in length t |d 1 − d 2 we can determine the path difference between the two beam of light when they recombine a p t 2 this path difference cause the light to be at a different phase at the photodetector and so an interference pattern be generate different wavelength of light will interfere differently until the null point be reach where p t 0 and there be maximum constructive interference by vary p and take the output from the photodiode at each point we be able to produce an interferogram s ince a path difference be create between the two beam in an interferometer and light have a finite speed the path difference will translate into an effective temporal difference between the two beam this allows u to use a fourier transform to move between the time domain and the frequency domain for a specific wavenumber k 0 the intensity at the photodetector be give by where i k be the intensity of the source at the wavenumber k. apply the superposition principle the intensity detetected at the photodiode for all wavelength be give by where i k be the intensity distribution for the light source this be simply a cosine fourier transform therefore to retreive the intensity distribution we simply need to compute the inverse cosine fourier transform in practice we can take the real part of an inverse fourier transform a the signal be real t here be many different mechanism for light emission for a normal lead i.e the blue lead in our experiment electron travel over a band gap in a pn junction the potential difference on each side of the junction be different and this cause them to emit a photon of a specific wavelength to conserve energy in the white `` lead `` an lead be incident upon a fluorescent material this cause the photon emit by the lead to be absorbed by the material and re-emitted a a wide spectrum of different wavelength cause the light to appear white this be possible a the absorbed energy be first transfer away by vibration in the material before later be radiate away a a photon in a white tungsten lamp a filament be heat up and begin to emit many diffrent wavelength of light a a black body this mechanism consists of electron in the tungsten become excite to many different energy level and then transition down to many other level cause a wide array of different wavelength to be emit this spectrum of emission be give by planck 's law 6 where h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light k b be boltzmann 's constant and t be the temperature of the body the emission from a mercury gas discharge lamp be again cause by electron fall down energy level in a mercury atom a the mercury be a gas the atom be in thermal motion and so have momentum when a photon be release it energy may vary depend on the momentum of the atom this be know a doppler broadening and the derivation yield a gaussian emission profile 7 a. alignment f irst the component of the interferometer be attach to the optical table a show in figure 1. the next step be to align each component start at the beam splitter the light from the beam splitter be first make to be incident to the motorise mirror m2 centrally and perpendicularly to the surface of the mirror next the current distace between the beam splitter and m2 be measure when the motor be set to it middle location this distance be use to place m1 a very similar distance away in order to minimise time spent search for the null point and maximise the potential range the interferogram may be take over this mirror be also make to have light incident to it centrally and perpendicularly it be useful to check the beam splitter for the reflection to confirm this finally the photodetector be align such that the recombine beam be incident to it 's detector alignment be checked by make sure that the reflection from both mirror overlap each other completely the null point be the point at p 0 and may be found through a variety of different method the first be to simply move m2 through it 's full range and take a interferogram of white light to see when the intensity peak the second be to use a green laser and count the number of fringe observe at the photodetector this can be do by place a white surface in front of the photodetector the third method be to slowly move the mirror m2 at roughly 1µms −1 and observe whether the fringe appear to move `` out `` or `` in `` the fringe will start move in the other direction once the null point have be pas method 2 and 3 with a green laser be combine to perform a binary search until the region contain the null point be small enough to switch to white light and scan over the region the null point be found from the point on the interferogram with maximum interference after the null point be found collect data be quite trivial the source and filter may be varied and different interferograms take about the null point the mirror be make to start and finish at approximately the same distance to the null point it be important to note that the distance range of the interferogram be proportional to the resolution of the fourier transform and the resolution of the interferogram be proportional to the range of the fourier transform therefore in order to get good resolution large range be take and we also make sure to move the mirror slow enough to detect sufficiently small wavelength t he interferograms of the various source be show in the follow figure the position variable be position of the mirror and not from the null point although the null point be extremely close to the mirror 's 0 position these graph be sometimes hard to read a they contain many data point which blur together it can be see from these that the wider source of light have narrower coherence length the spectrum found by take the fourier transform of the interferograms be show in the follow figure the error on the fit be generate use an estimate covariance matrix not all spectrum have theoretical background for use a gaussian fit however it be convenient since it be simple and quantifies an approximation for the full-width-half-maximum the amplitude value on the graph be simply a 24 bit number output from the photodetector and have no unit the gaussian for the blue lead give a mean of 484.84 ± and standard deviation 13 ± 1 nm the white spectrum appear to contain two gaussians however we be unable to fit a second the mean wavelength here be 560 ± 1 nm and the standard deviation 76 ± 13 nm the standard deviation for this spectrum be much high than for the blue lead a expect the tungsten spectrum should theoretically be a black body spectrum and so fit use planck 's law however potentially due to the sensitivity of the photodiode to different wavelength the output appear very similar to a gaussian and so a gaussian be use this give a mean wavelength of 805.9±0.2 nm and standard deviation 119±7 nm notably the mean wavelength lie outside the visible range however the standard deviation be so great that the lamp appear white the fit for the green filter tungsten spectrum theoretically would be a convolution of the sensitivity of the photodiode with planck 's law however a gaussian again seem to be a good enough approximation the mean wavelength be 531.09±0.04 nm and the standard deviation 18±4 nm the green filter be able to filter all other wavelength exceptionally well and it be no surprise that this mean wavelength lie in the green part of the spectrum fig 12. a spectrum of a tungsten lamp with a yellow filter the spectrum be again narrower but can be see to be shift to the right slightly again use a gaussian for the yellow filter tungsten spectrum we find a mean of 569.8 ± 0.4 nm lie in the yellow part of visible light the standard deviation be found to be 24 ± 4 nm this mercury spectrum show the two region we be interested in the green peak and the yellow doublet we use filter to focus on the two area separately a gaussian fit to the green filter mercury show a mean wavelength of 547.4 ± 0.2 nm and a standard deviation of 30±4 nm this agrees quite close with the accepted value of the emission at 546.1nm 8 the 0.24 discrepancy between our value and the accepted value be potentially due to the variable sensitivity of the photodiode and with far analysis this could be account for we be unable to fit to the doublet spectrum however just reading from the graph it be possible to see that the mean wavelength be about 573nm and 620nm this difficulty in fitting may have be cause by take an interferogram over too long a range and so increase the number of noise data point we be able to use a hilbert transform to plot and fit to the envelope of the blue lead and mercury lamp interferograms the standard deviation of these gaussians agree with the spectrum assume that they be the fourier transforms of the spectrum gaussians a expect v. conclusion t he goal of this experiment be to record interferograms characterise spectrum from various source this be do quite effectively with the measure value for the mercury green line found to be 546.4 ± 0.2 nm which agrees with the nist accepted value well than 0.24 to improve this experiment interferograms could be take to reduce the amount of data in some of the fourier transforms and the effect of the photodiode sensitivity curve account for,superficial,bal,60,0.285865068,0.714134932
58,2ndINT_QPL350_Redacted,the main object of this experiment be to analyse the spectrum of different light source by measure the interferogram which could be fourier transform to spectrum in this experiment the characteristic of the green laser white lead blue lead and tungsten lamp be investigate the spectrum of those different light source be plot a well a calculate the coherent length and spectral width for each of those light source by fitting a gaussian function to the fourier-transformed interferogram some improvement be discus at the end of the lab report i nterferometry be a strong and precise technique by take advantage of the interference phenomenon of wave normally electromagnetic wave interferometer be usually use to measure small displacement refractive index and other precise measurement the most famous application of interferometry be the discovery of gravitational wave in ligo use a fabryprot interferometer which be basically a michelson interferometer the configuration of the interferometer use in this experiment be the michelson interferometer the light after reflection by the mirror travel the opposite direction compare to the light before but with the same path the path be separate in the diagram be for clear illustration this graph be reproduce from 1 interference be a very common phenomenon when two wave of the same frequency superpose base on the principle of superposition the superposition principle will be discus in later section in this experiment we measure the interferogram of many different type of light source include green laser white lead blue lead white tungsten bulb itself and tungsten bulb with green and yellow filter the green laser be monochromatic since in theory it consists of only one frequency of light other light source investigate in this experiment generate light which consists of a range of frequency after fourier transformation the interferogram will be transform into a spectrum in this report the characteristic of the interferogram and spectrum of all the aforementioned light source be discus both quantitatively and qualitatively such a the mean wavelength coherent length spectral width and shape of interferogram around the null point in this section the theoretical and mathematical background of the interference michelson interferometer fourier transform be introduce when two wave of the same frequency meet they will superpose accord to the superposition principle in other word the net amplitude of the resultant wave form at one point be the sum of the amplitude of the two individual wave at that point when two wave be in phase constructive interference occurs result in bright fringe whereas destructive interference occurs when two wave be out of phase create dark fringe the type of fringe produce by a michelson interferometer be determine by the set up of the apparatus for example the position of the mirror to understand this imagine the two mirror be place a show in figure 1 at exactly right angle to each other for convenient calculation and simple illustration the setup mention could be consider a the same in the diagram a of figure 2. the relationship between the separation t and the wavelength λ of the incident could be described by the equation where m be the order of interference and refractive index be assume to be 1. due to the cylindrical symmetry of the case in figure 3b haidinger fringe will be produce if the incident light be monochromatic when one of the mirror be tilt a show in figure 2b the cylindrical symmetry be broken create fizeau fringe identify the fringe form be of great importance in the alignment of the mirror and the beam splitter a michelson spectrometer consists of five main part a light source two mirror a beam splitter and a detector or screen a show in figure 1. monochromatic wave be emit from the light source laser and split into two beam due to the beam splitter the reflect beam travel to mirror 1 and reflect back superpose with the beam pas through the beam splitter and refle cted by mirror 2. after superposition the resultant light beam be project on the screen or detector create interference fringe when the path distance l1 and l2 be of the same distance constructive interference occurs conversely if there be exactly λ 2 path difference between l1 and l2 there be no light on the detector due to destructive interference therefore move either mirror one or mirror two by a fraction of the wavelength will influence the fringe produce on the screen however the dielectric plate on the beam splitter introduces a phase shift for one of the split beam which mean that the destructive interference occurs when two path be of the same length an interferogram can be plot by measure the intensity of the light project on the detector and the position of one the mirror the interferogram can be use to determine the coherent length of the light source and after fourier transform it becomes a spectrum which be useful in the analysis of the characteristic of the light source such a the spectral width and the mean wavelength normally the fourier transform of a function refers to the transformation of a function f t in the time domain to a new function g w in the frequency domain a define in equation 2. conversely the inverse fourier transform can transform a function in the frequency domain to the time domain use equation 3. the fourier transform of a gaussian function could be solve by integrate by part this give a form of the gaussian function in the frequency domain however fast fourier transform fft be use in this experiment which be more efficient and convenient for the computer to calculate the fft base on discrete fourier transform transforms a sample of equallyspaced sample of function delta function in this case to a same-length sequence of equally-spaced sample of complex function of frequency 4 the fouriertransformed gaussian function can be use to describe the result from fft therefore it be possible to fourier transform the interferogram in time domain to retrieve a spectrum with it frequency composition a show in figure 4. a gaussian function could be fit to the spectrum in figure 4b the spectral width could be consider a the σ in the gaussian function and can be calculate by the fwhm full width at half maximum of the fit gaussian use equation 6. the spectral width calculate be in meter which could be convert to hertz with the equation where c be the speed of light and λ be the centre wavelength then the coherent length l could be found use the formula also it be possible to measure the coherent length from the interferogram and calculate the spectral width use equation 8. for this experiment the apparatus setup be the same a the michelson interferometer in figure 1. the position of the mirror 1 be at a fix distance from the beam splitter and mirror 2 be carry by an electric motor the mirror1 be adjust so that it be approximately perpendicular to mirror 2 and parallel to the side of the cubic-shaped beam splitter that it face the alignment could be checked by align two beam of a green laser to a screen use two plano-convex lens to convert the light beam to an extend source if haidinger fringe be produce then the apparatus be correctly align the plano-convex lens be only use for the green laser when try to align for other light source such a the white lead and blue lead a diffuser be use to acquire a more spread uniform light source what 's more the interferometer and light source be place inside a black box to minimize the noise from other light source in the laboratory all of the measurement be take by a computer the data of the intensity of light be collect by a photodiode detector the parameter that be adjustable be the position of the mirror carry by the motor speed of the motor and the frequency to take the data point the default frequency be at 50 hz during the lab cycle 3 my partner and i obtain the interferograms for the green laser white lead blue lead tungsten bulb and tungsten bulb with green and yellow filter all of the interferograms be fourier-transformed to spectrum to proceed far analysis there be a slight misalignment for all of the measurement which cause asymmetry in the interferogram plot this be solve by subtract the diagonal line from the original data the data use to proceed fft be the modify data the spectral width of the green laser spectrum be calculate to be 1.98±0.07 × 10 13 hz which in term of meter be 1.83±0.06 × 10 −8 m. the mean peak wavelength be found to be 527±17 nm and the coherent length be 2.42±0.09 µm in theory the green laser beam be monochromatic which mean that it contains only one frequency of light and produce only one peak in the fourier-transformed spectrum however in the spectrum show in figure 5 there be several peak instead of one peak also in the interferogram of the green laser beating appear which mean that the laser provide be not a monochromatic a we think this be due to the limitation of the uncertainty principle a light source can never be perfectly monochromatic despite the laser be not perfectly monochromatic the fairly narrow spectral width compare to other light source make it a good source to generate sharp and clear interference pattern for the alignment a show in figure 6. fig 6 green laser interference pattern this figure be take after proper alignment a show in the figure the fringe form be concentric circle which agrees to our theory it could be see from the figure that the brightness of top right fringe be high than that of the bottom left fringe this be due to slightly misalignment of the mirror more detailed information will be discus in the error analysis section the mean peak measure for the blue lead be 466±14 nm with a spectral width of 12.5±1.9 nm and the coherent length be found to be 1182±17 nm this be within the range of the blue light which be from 400 nm to 495 nm the main mean peak for fit gaussian of the spectrum of the white lead be at 582±16 nm with an uncertainty of nm moreover a see from figure 7 there be also a peak on the white lead spectrum at 456 nm with an uncertainty of nm which be also within the blue light range the cause of this unexpected peak on the white lead spectrum be the manufacture of the white lead blue red and green lead be the three most common lead use in our daily life the white lead use in the experiment be manufacture base on a blue lead cover with fluorescent material that illuminate a variety of light that combine together to form white light the peak in the blue light region be due to the blue lead inside the white lead the spectral width of the white lead be 61.2±7.3 nm which in the frequency spectrum be 5.42±0.64 × 10 12 hz the coherent length of the white lead be 881±11 nm compare the gaussian function g in the time domain with the gaussian function g equation 4 and equation 5 it be clear that a wide spectral line in the spectrum result in a narrower interferogram the result from the experiment for blue and white lead be consistent with the theoretical prediction what 's more the emission spectrum of both blue lead and white lead be within the visible optical range for human eye which mean that most of the energy be use to generate visible light this characteristic of the lead make them more efficient illuminate tool compare to the traditional incandescent light bulb a see from the spectrum of the white tungsten lamp the majority of the frequency be locate in the infrared region with some relatively small peak in the visible spectrum after fitting with a gaussian function around the main peak it be found that the mean peak wavelength be at 963±28 nm with a spectral width of 191±6 nm the coherent length be calculate to be 910±26 nm the vast amount of emission of infrared make the tungsten bulb a much less efficient way of illumination most of the energy be transfer to the creation of infrared which could cause heating effect around the surroundings therefore tungsten bulb a well a other type of incandescent light bulb be good heating source moreover the tungsten bulb could be approximate to a black body with a peak emission at 963±28 nm use wiens displacement law the temperature of the tungsten bulb be calculate to be 3008±89 k. when place behind a green filter the spectral width be calculate to be 13.1±1 nm with a peak at 509±14 nm when replace by a yellow filter the peak shit to 544±15 nm with a spectral width of 15±1 nm the coherent length for the green and yellow filter be calculate to be 3.1±0.1 µm and 3.2±0.1 µm respectively this prof that the filter be good band-pass filter with very small bandwidth it be clear from figure 8 that the filter wave be in the visible spectrum but with relatively small intensity compare to the infrared emission from the white tungsten lamp the main error in the experiment be from misalignment which cause asymmetry in the interferogram when do fft to the asymmetric interferogram the mean wavelength of the light source may shift compare to the situation when the apparatus be perfectly align we found it difficult to make perfect alignment during the experiment after try for a multiple of time the mirror carry by the electric motor be fix in position and could not be adjust this mirror may not be perpendicular to the ground or it may tilt slightly which could be a source of misalignment there be speck of dust on the surface of the beam splitter which could also influence the alignment another source of error be the fast fourier transform the fft be base on the discrete fourier analysis which be only valid for equally-spaced discrete value from the data collect by the computer we found that the electric motor do not move with a constant interval this could cause a shift of peak value and a change in spectral width for the spectrum transform by fft there be also an uncertainty in the function fitting what 's more although place in a black box there could be a leak of noise from other light source in the laboratory however this effect be too small compare to the other two error source thus this effect could be neglect there be several improvement that we could make for this experiment the default sample frequency of the detector be 50 hz this mean that to take data for a long range of distance it could take hour to proceed we could have change this frequency during the experiment to proceed the experiment more efficiently a long a the sample rate be within the nyquist frequency beyond the nyquist frequency aliasing effect could occur result in an incorrect interferogram moreover multiple interferograms of the same light source could have be take to get more accurate result during the measurement of the tungsten lamp the bulb wire be heat to a high temperature the tungsten lamp could have be switch off and cool between successive measurement my partner and i successfully construct a spectrometer use a michelson interferometer and a computer do fft after obtain proper interferograms for the green laser the white lead the blue lead the tungsten bulb and the same tungsten bulb with green and yellow filter we do fourier analysis to the interferograms to get their correspond spectrum by fitting gaussian function to the spectrum of those light source we calculate the spectral width the mean wavelength and the coherent length for each of those source then we analyze their function with the characteristic we get from their spectrum lead be energy-saving and efficient light source which could be use for illumination tungsten bulb be good heating source due to the vast emission in the infrared spectrum the yellow and green filter be bandwidth filter that only allows a very narrow range of frequency of light pa through in the end the error source and improvement be discus,extended,bal,70,0.297305942,0.702694118
51,2ndINT_IHJ555_Redacted,this experiment demonstrates the construction and use of a michelson interferometer a simulation of the experiment be complete use python before any physical experiment the result from both simulation and the physical attempt be compare and discus by use the interferometer a a spectrometer we obtain and investigate the interferograms of a blue lead light a white lead light and a tungsten light source then fast fourier transform fft be perform on the interferograms to reconstruct the light source some interest feature discover from observation be also discus in this report albert michelson invent the interferometer in the late 19 th century when he and edward morley perform the `` michelson-morley experiment `` 1 at that time physicist believe that there must be a medium which allow the propagation of light to happen this medium be call ether they thought that ether form an ether wind across earth 's surface which control the speed of the travel light since the earth be constantly move in it orbit unless the ether maintain stationary relative to the earth all the time the light emit from a source on earth 's surface would change accord to the magnitude and direction of the ether wind 5 michelson and morley assume that if two light beam travel the same distance through ether but in different path their speed would be different and an interference pattern would be create for them to calculate the speed of ether relative to the earth therefore prove it existence however they found no evidence in the change of light 's speed regardless of which path the light travel along 6 this experiment be regard a the most famous fail experiment and be a strong evidence against the existence of ether 5 today interferometer be widely use a investigative tool in science they merge two or more source of light to create interference pattern allow scientist to measure and analyse the light source 1 a simple demonstration of the interferometer be show in fig 1. the michelson interferometer can also be use a a spectrometer by change the path length travel by the light beam the interference pattern will change and can be observe by analyse the interferograms and the resultant figure after fft be perform on them we obtain information about the location of the null point the coherence length and the spectral width for each light source a show in fig 1. the incident light emit from the source go through the beam splitter where half of the light be allow to pa through and the other half be reflect at 90 degree to the first one 1 each beam travel to a mirror then be reflect and travel back to the beam splitter where they be merge back into one single beam before travel to the detector whilst recombine they interfere with each other if the distance from the beam splitter to the two mirror be exactly the same or differ by nλ where n be an integer the two beam will interfere constructively and give a bright fringe output however if the distance travel by the two beam differ by nλ/2 where n be an odd integer the two beam will interfere destructively and cancel each other out leave no light to be detect by the detector 2 in this experiment we fix the position of one mirror and move the other mirror to change the distance travel by one of the two beam thus obtain an interferogram of the light when the two mirror be align at 90 degree to each other a circular fringe pattern which be call the `` haidinger fringe `` appear consider light come in at an angle θ a show in fig 2. constructive interference will only occur at specific value of θ which give an integral number of wavelength in the resultant path difference investigate different source of light from interferograms assume the refractive index of the medium be 1 we can derive the equation govern the angle θ to be where t be the separation of the two mirror θ be the angle form by the reflect light from the mirror and the horizontal accord to theory when two light beam with two different frequency interfere with each other a beating pattern will form a show in fig 3. the closer the two frequency be to each other the longer the separation between the null be the reason for this be that when the frequency of the wave differ by a large number the two wave be more likely to 'catch up with each other in a shorter time than two wave with closer frequency would a show in fig 4. where the two wave on the top have closer frequency than the two wave on the bottom the faster wave always form a large number of wave than the slow one do before the next null but the closer their frequency be the longer the time between each null point thus the few the number of null point form within certain time interval by perform fast fourier transform fft on the interferograms we reconstruct the light source from the resultant figure we found the coherence length of the source l which be the range before the interferogram contrast become poor by use where l be the coherence length in m c be the speed of light we found the spectral width of the source ∆ν in hz which be the measure of the range of frequency emit by the source another theory worth mention here be that object with temperature above absolute zero emits radiation one of the light source use in this experiment be tungsten light it light up by heating up the filament therefore we can use where λ 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 be the mean wavelength to calculate the temperature t in kelvin of the filament at the time when λ 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 be observe to investigate how change the path length the light travel affect the interference pattern and to find the location of the null point we built an interferometer and use different source of light to obtain several set of data for our analyzation an image of the experimental set-up be show in fig 5. we first use a green laser to align the interferometer the distance from the laser source to the two mirror and the detector be measure to be 7 inch each we use a white board and a 25mm lens to help u adjust the alignment since this be an easy way to see the position of the two light beam when the circular fringe be form a show in fig 6. the equipment be align properly and the two light beam be interfere by use a python code which control the move rate of the mirror stage we take a large amount of data to plot the interferograms since the null point be define to be the point where t=m=0 accord to equation 1 θ need to increase in order for cosθ to reach zero and to satisfy the null point condition thus the fringe will move inward if it be move towards the null point and outward if it be move away from the null point by try to find the location where the fringe change from go inward to go outward we determine the range of the null point location in order to increase our efficiency we first use the green laser to observe the fringe and narrow the range down after obtain the narrow range we only scan this range for other light source to find the null point there be many source of error present in this experiment for example since the equipment be extremely sensitive a knock on the table or people walk around result in inaccuracy of the data take since we use our judgement when we read the data from the graph there be an error associate with each reading in addition we could not completely isolate the light source whilst perform the experiment which mean that light from other source be affect the measurement we ran several simulation use python to investigate and get a rough idea of what the result would be like the image obtain from the simulation be show in fig 7. and fig 8. the wavelength we use in the simulation be approximately 600nm a the figure show when more spectral line be add the middle part remain similar but small beating pattern could be see on each side this be an indication of interference of light with two different frequency when the stage be move too fast the dark and bright fringe be change at a rate so fast that the detector be not able to record it properly when we decrease the move rate of the stage to be around 0.001mm/s the result be clearer therefore in this experiment data be take with the stage move at 0.001mm/s when the gain of the amplifier be too large the graph appear clip the top of the line becomes straight instead of curvy a show in graph 1.0. an appropriate gain be found before take our measurement graph 1.0. clip graph due to large gain of the amplifier let the mid-point of the mirror stage be zero when the mirror be move far away in positive direction from position +8mm the fringe be go outward when the mirror be move in positive direction far away from position +7mm the fringe be go inward thus we determine that the null point should be between +7 to +8mm we scan this range for the blue lead light and found the null point position to be +7.3368mm accord to the interferogram which be show in fig 9. by observe this interferogram we narrow the range of the null point position down to between +7.239mm and +7.345mm for scan other light source by observe the interferogram of light from each source we determine the position of their null point the result be show in table 1.0. the theoretical wavelength of blue light be 435nm to 500 nm a fig 10. show the wavelength of blue light obtain from our data be around 460nm to 520nm which be close to the theoretical value this prof that the fft do reconstruct the light source from this figure we also found that it mean wavelength λ 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 to be about 480.2nm and it coherence length to be 7.334 -7.340mm by use equation 2 along with the data obtain we found that the spectral width of this blue lead light to be 6.505 × 10 9 -6.510 × 10 9 hz by use the same method we found that the coherence length of white lead light tungsten light without green filter and tungsten light with green filter to be 7.333-7.340mm 7.332-7.334mm 7.320-7.350mm respectively the mean wavelength of white lead light tungsten light without green filter and tungsten light with green filter to be 603nm 857nm 556nm respectively the spectral width of white lead light tungsten light without green filter and tungsten light with green filter to be 6.505 × 10 9 -6.511 × 10 9 hz 6.510 × 10 9 -6.513 × 10 9 hz 6.500 × 10 9 -6.523 × 10 9 hz respectively these data be summarize in table ii the interferograms of the tungsten light be interest fig 11. show that some data point seem to go horizontally which be unexpected we think that those data point be take when the mirror first start to move or when it stop since the equipment be very sensitive a tiny shake or movement can have big impact on the data which be the one take when no filter be use we see that the middle shape remains similar for both case however the side appear to have beating pattern when a filter be use we think that this be because the filter filter out some wavelength the remain light 's wavelength be very different from each other thus when they interfere with each other a beating pattern be observe also the data seem messier we think that this be due to the unclearness of the filter after fft be perform on the interferograms the shape of the one without filter look like one for black body radiation a show in fig 13. the tail never go to zero because all matter with temperature above absolute zero emit radiation tungsten 's high melt point be useful in this case since the filament heat up during the process 4 we use equation 3 to calculate the temperature of the filament when λ 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 be observe which turn out to be 338k from fig 13. we can see that the range of wavelength exceeds the visible light range this be because when atom heat up they gain energy when they fall back to a low energy level the excessive energy radiate away and be see a light however only a small fraction of radiate energy occurs in the visible wavelength range the rest of the energy radiate away at infrared wavelength 4 another interest thing about tungsten light we notice be that when we be at a very close distance to the null point light emit from the tungsten light source appear to have different color on the detector a show in fig 14. this be because when we be near the null point the interference be the strong and the interference of the light with different wavelength give off light with different color the interferograms of a blue lead a white lead light and a tungsten light be obtain in this experiment fft be perform on these interferograms to reconstruct the light source from the resultant figure we obtain the mean wavelength coherence length and the spectral width of the source tungsten light without filter appear to have the long mean wavelength which be 857nm this be follow by 603nm of the white lead light 480nm of the blue lead light and 56nm of the tungsten light with a green filter use by use the coherence length obtain we calculate the spectral width for each of the source which be 6.505 × 10 9 -6.510 × 10 9 hz 6.505 × 10 9 -6.511 × 10 9 hz 6.510 × 10 9 -6.513 × 10 9 hz 6.500 × 10 9 -6.523 × 10 9 hz for the blue lead light white lead light tungsten light without green filter and tungsten light with green filter respectively by compare the interferograms of each light source and the resultant figure after fft be perform on them we discover some interest feature about these source for example the miss wavelength of the tungsten light when a green filter be use on it the dissymmetry of the white lead interferogram etc regard operation in the lab no major issue occur throughout the experiment in conclusion in this experiment we construct an interferometer investigate the effect of fast fourier

24,2ndINT_MJV182_Redacted,this investigation explores the use of a michelson interferometer to perform spectroscopy on various light source to deduce their characteristic after construct the michelson interferometer interferograms be record for each light source then the fourier transform take for each signal to produce their wavelength spectrum from these coherence length spectral width and peak wavelength value be obtain to characterise each source the white light sources-the tungsten lamp and the white led-had the large spectral width correspond to these contain wavelength across the entire visible light spectrum the tungsten lamp through assumption a a black body be found to operate at a temperature of 3430±20 k and the spectral sensitivity of the detector be found to have a considerable but correctable convolution effect on the spectrum for source with filter apply the spectral data could not be accurately evaluate a the signal intensity be too low in relation to the background light present far extension to this experiment could investigate an experimental modification to increase signal intensity for the filter source an investigation into the dispersion effect of the medium in the interferometer and fitting different type of curve to the interferogram and spectral data to find the most accurate fit to these shape t he michelson interferometer be devise in 1887 by the physicist albert a. michelson and edward w. morley to attempt to prove the existence of a lumniferous aether through which light wave travel 1 despite unanimously disprove this theory their interferometer have ultimately have a much wider impact on experimental physic prevail right through to modern physic with the 2015 observation of gravitational wave make use an advanced michelson interferometer ligo 2 since the output of interferometry an interferogram be dependent on the frequency of the input wave these can be analyse use fourier theory to discover the incident frequency hence perform spectroscopy on the input this experiment aim to construct a work michelson interferometer and use it to analyse the spectral composition of various electromagnetic source by take the fourier transform of their interferograms hence deduce the wavelength spectrum compose each source a show by the ray diagram in figure 1 the michelson interferometer u a beam-splitter-in the form of a partiallysilvered mirror-to split an incident beam into two perpendicular beam of equal intensity these beam be each reflect back towards the beam-splitter where they partially reflect and recombine again to produce a superposition beam of the two split beam propagate away at 90 • to the incidence angle of the source it be evident that the two beam interfere when recombine with the interference pattern dependent on the difference in optical path length of the two interferometer arm this be easy to visualise for a plane-wave monochromatic light source-if the path length be the same or differ by integer multiple of the source 's wavelength λ the recombine beam will be in phase with each other and constructively interfere if the path length differ by λ 2 the recombine beam will be exactly out of phase and deconstructively interfere the beamsplitter use in this experiment have a dielectric coat on one side cause one of the beam to undergo a phase change this be such that instead destructive interference occurs when the arm be of equal length the position of the movable mirror for equal optical path length know a the 'null point hence by vary the position of the movable mirror the wavelength-or more generally the wavelength spectrum-of the source can be precisely measure the type of interference fringe see at the output depends on the collimation of the source and the alignment of the interferometer for a perfectly collimate plane-wave light source and assume perfect alignment of the interferometer the interfere beam will be align with each other and their interference will be uniform throughout the output however since perfect collimation be difficult and not particularly useful it be necessary to consider an extend source where the incidence angle θ of the ray will vary assume perfect right-angled alignment of the interferometer and placement of the source in respect to it optical axis there will be a cylindrical symmetry of the beam along the optical ax hence the fringe in the interference pattern will arise only at certain value of θ where t be the position of the mirror from the null point and m be any integer this effectuates circular 'haidinger fringe around the optical axis center if the interferometer be not perfectly align the symmetry around the optical axis be broken result in linear parallel equal-thickness 'fizeau fringe fourier theory be the principle that any function or signal can be represent a a superposition of sinusoidal function by calculate this sum of sinusoid an original signal can be transform into a domain define by the frequency of these sinusoid this be the 'fourier transform where f be the mathematical operator for the fourier transform if f x be a function in the spatial domain f k be a function in the spatial frequency domain conversely a function in the spatial domain can be retrieve by take the inverse fourier transform denote by f −1 of a function in the spatial frequency domain without any information lose consequently if information about a signal be store in the form of it fourier transform the inverse fourier transform can be apply to return the original signal 3 such pair function be term fourier transform pair notable example include a sinusoid and a dirac delta function centre at the sinusoidal frequency or two gaussian function with interrelate width again consider a monochromatic source in the michelson interferometer the overall intensity of the output signal f varies with path length x where k be the wavenumber 2π λ of the monochromatic source and i 0 be the average intensity of each split beam extend this for a source emit a continuous spectrum of wavelength e k the interference signal from an infinitesimal spectral element dk will be integrate over the entire spectrum of frequency and subtract out the constant term 2 define e −k e k for mathematical simplicity where i x and e k be a fourier transform pair hence by record a source 's interferogram the fourier transform of this return the spectral composition of the source 4 a the range of wavelength in a source increase it be define to have a large spectral width ∆ν correspond to a narrower coherence length l by where c be the speed of light this width enumerates the range of frequency present in light source common light source include filament lamp lead laser and gas discharge lamp each have a different method of generate light and consequently a different spectral composition a peak in a wavelength spectrum of light be conventionally call a 'spectral line 1 filament lamp filament lamp emit light by passing an electric current through a metal filament usually tungsten heating it to high temperature since these metal generally act a black body radiator the thermal energy be emit a black body radiation 5 the majority of this electromagnetic radiation be in the infrared region of the spectrum however the light produce in the visible range be relatively continuous and appear a white light wien 's displacement law relates the peak wavelength in the spectrum λ peak to the temperature t of the filament 2 lead since there be no such thing a an single lead which emits purely white light there be two conventional method to simulate white light the first method the 'rgb configuration u a red blue and green lead close together simulate a continuous spectrum over the visible light range it spectrum have three clear peak at the wavelength of red blue and green light the other type u a single shortwavelength led-usually blue-along with a phosphorous coat the coat absorbs some of the shorter wavelength light and emits it at longer wavelength thus white light be simulated from the combination of the narrower shortwavelength spectral line from the blue lead and the wider longer-wavelength phosphorescence line 6 3 gas discharge lamp gas discharge lamp emit light by passing an electric field through an ionise gas cause electron in the gas to be excite to high energy state when the electron return to their pre-excited energy level they emit this energy difference in the form of electromagnetic light of a wavelength λ inversely-proportional to the energy gap ∆e between the excite and unexcited state where h be planck 's constant hence the spectrum of such a light source depends on the atomic structure of the specific gas 7 for a mercury gas discharge lamp this result in spectral line at wavelength of 405 436 546 and 579 nm 11 on an optical table the interferometer be construct a in figure 1 where a non-adjustable mirror be place on a motorise stage to effectuate the movable mirror and a photo-diode detector use to measure the output signal the other mirror be kinematic allow for adjustment to align the apparatus and a clamp be use to secure the source in position the component be place relatively close together to ease the alignment process and ensure the signal incident on the detector have a great enough intensity to align the interferometer a green laser be use due to it large coherence length and be monochromatic meaning the interference fringe be easily visible to the human eye first the beam be roughly align by overlap the path of the beam at various point in the optical path then the kinematic mirror use to fine-tune the alignment until haidinger fringe be visible on a screen place in front of the detector-indicating perfect alignment with the motorise stage and the detector control by command from the linux terminal the interferogram of a source could be digitally record a linear gradient in the background intensity value of this interferogram indicate an alignment imperfection in which case the alignment procedure be repeat until this gradient be minimise since the coherence length be much small for other source than the green laser the interferogram be only detectable over a very short range of mirror position around the null point this require the mirror position for the null point to be accurately know around the null point the number of fringe present in the interference pattern reduces to a minimum thus use the green laser to produce visible fringe the mount mirror be position at 1mm interval across it range from -10mm to 10mm and the number of fringe count at each point this narrow down the search range to within a millimetre replace the green laser with a white lead with a rough coherence length of 10μm the interferogram be scan over this range detect the mirror position of the interference pattern centre to a precision of around 5 micron the source analyse with the interferometer be a white and a blue lead a tungsten lamp with and without a yellow filter and a mercury gas discharge lamp with a green then a yellow filter the interferograms be scan for each source across the null point over a mirror position range of 50μm at a stage speed of 0.5μm/s this speed be kept low to increase the spatial sample frequency hence prevent any beating effect in the interferogram for the tungsten lamp with the filter and the mercury lamp in general the signal be too weakly diffuse after propagate through the interferometer to detect a notable signal at the detector to recify this a plano-convex lens be use between the beam-splitter and the detector to increase the intensity of the signal on the detector for these source analyse the interferograms of the source a gaussian curve be plot onto the amplitude of each interferogram from which the coherence length and subsequently the spectral width of each source could be calculate the fourier transform of each interferogram be then take to produce their wavelength spectrum since the sensitivity of the photodiode detector varies with wavelength the spectrum obtain from the source will be convolute with this function a function be fit to approximate this spectral sensitivity which be use to deconvolute the signal and return correct spectrum for the lead and the mercury lamp the peak wavelength of the spectrum be deduce by assume the spectral line to be gaussian curve for the tungsten lamp the spectrum be analyse a black body radiation curve by approximate the peak wavelength of the spectrum the temperature of the tungsten lamp be estimate by apply wien 's law the interferograms for the white lead figure 2 blue lead figure 3 and unfiltered tungsten figure 4 be show below with gaussian curve fit to their amplitude where σ be the width of each gaussian the interferograms record for the filter tungsten lamp and mercury lamp do not show a clear increase in amplitude to which a curve could be plot to find the coherence length take the fourier transform of the interferograms give wavelength spectrum for the blue lead figure 5 white lead figure 7 unfiltered tungsten lamp figure 8 tungsten lamp with the yellow filter figure 9 and the mercury lamp with yellow and green filter figure 10 these spectrum be correct to account for the spectral sensitivity of the detector by devise a function show in figure 6 to approximate the photodiode sensitivity provide in it function sheet 8 this be use to deconvolute the signal and return correct wavelength spectrum note that the white lead spectrum have a sharper peak in the blue wavelength range and a wider peak within the longer wavelength it appear to be configure in the form of a blue lead with a phosphor coat compare this white lead spectrum before and after correction figure 7 show the blue peak 's amplitude become large than that of the phosphor peak be similar to other find 9 this show the deconvoluted spectrum be more accurate to the real source spectrum the key characteristic of each light source be show in table i with the spectral width value calculate use equation 9. the lack of coherence length and spectral width data for the yellow-filtered tungsten lamp and mercury lamp be due to the lack of a pattern in their interferograms this meant a curve could n't be fit to derive coherence length value and hence spectral width value the value could have instead be calculate from the source spectrum however these show only approximate spectral peak a reason for this low-quality data could be an issue with the alignment of the interferometer however consider this alignment work for the other three source the issue be more likely due to the low intensity of these source configuration on the detector-these source be those with a weaker signal a mention in 'method the spectrum for the unfiltered tungsten lamp figure 8 after correction for the detector 's spectral sensitivity resembles that of a black body radiator with a peak in the visible spectrum at 845±5 nm apply wien 's law this corresponds to a temperature of 3430±20 k. this be a typical value for the operating temperature of a tungsten lamp affirm that the black body assumption be valid 10 the spectrum for the tungsten lamp with a yellow filter figure 9 show a wide noisy spectral line

limited to the yellow spectral range the derive mercury lamp spectrum with the respective filter show peak in the mercury spectrum at approximately 550nm and 580nm this be roughly consistent with the know emission spectrum of mercury which contains spectral line at 546nm and 578nm 11 however the high level of noise and the fact the two spectrum overlap considerably mean the determination of these value be ambiguous at the least a with the tungsten lamp the derive mercury spectrum be likely to be convolution of the general mercury spectrum with the respective spectral filter of the green and yellow filter a see in table i the tungsten lamp and white lead have large spectral width small coherence length than the blue lead this figure a these be white light source contain a wide range of light frequency in the visible spectrum whereas the blue lead only contains frequency in the blue spectral range this be back up by the derive spectrum which show tungsten and the white lead a span the entire visible light range whereas the blue lead spectrum only span a range of 100nm from their spectrum the filter tungsten and mercury data appear to span a narrower electromagnetic range i.e small spectral width which be logical a these be only filter region of the source spectrum the error in the coherence length value and the peak wavelength of the blue lead white lead and tungsten lamp

far investigate the shape other curve such a a lorentzian could be fit for comparison the error in the spectral width and the temperature of the tungsten lamp be found through error propagation from the error in the coherence length and peak temperature of the unfiltered tungsten lamp the dispersion of light within the various medium of the interferometer be n't account for in the data analysis

38,2ndINT_CZD812_Redacted,fourier transform spectrometer in order to characterise 4 different light source the main aim of the experiment two white and blue lead and a white light tungsten source without and with a yellow bandpass filter a green laser be first use to find the null point of the apparatus so that the subsequent interferograms could be scan for their whole range about it for the aim of characterise different light source their light beam be sent into a fourier transform spectrometer and an interferogram be record about the null point see section i.ii this data be then process by an fft fast fourier transform algorithm in python to give the spectrum of each light source from which each source 's coherence length mean wavelength and spectral width can be calculate the spectral width be the fwhm full width half maximum of the spectrum graph related to the coherence length and mean wavelength by the follow formula 1 where δ hz be the spectral width of the source l m be the coherence length and c m -1 be the speed of light in a vacuum 2 where δ m be the spread of wavelength of the source see section i.iii the source be a white lead blue lead a white light tungsten source and the latter with a yellow bandpass filter 3 a an extension the temperature of the tungsten source be calculate by utilisation of wien 's displacement law see eqn 3 the root of interferometry date back to the 1800s towards the end of which michelson and morley conduct their famous `` fail `` experiment the aim of which be to measure the motion of the lab through the luminiferous ether their experiment be conduct by the use of a michelson interferometer where a light beam be sent to the input port half of the light be transmit while half of it be reflect through the beam splitter the separate light beam then travel perpendicularly to each other along the interferometer arm to two plane mirror normal to each beam where they get reflect and sent back to the beam splitter to recombine an interference pattern be observe at the output port the location of the fringe depends on the path difference and hence phase difference of the two beam 1 2 an application of the michelson interferometer be fourier transform spectrometry a michelson interferometer can be make into an ft by mount one of the mirror on a kinematic stage programmed by a computer to move at a constant velocity the signal measure at the output port of an ft be call the interferogram which be essentially the radiation intensity 1 when the path difference be equal to zero the recombine signal at the detector be in phase this point be call the null point which be indicate by the large amplitude of the interferogram 1 the far the mirror on the kinematic stage move from the null point the low the light intensity the `` coherence length be the distance the mirror can move before the interferogram contrast becomes poor `` 3 therefore in this experiment to characterise different light source scan be do about the null point to determine their coherence length mean wavelength and spectral width the latter of which `` be a measure of the range of frequency emit by a light source `` 3 the fast fourier transform fft be an algorithm to compute the dft discrete fourier transform of the interferogram initially the interferogram be in the spatial domain where the relative amplitude of the signal be plot against the position of the mirror the fft of this give the spectrum of the respective radiation source which be in the frequency domain where the wavelength be plot against the relative radiation intensity this be do in the case of this experiment by the python scipy library fftpack 4 for the interferogram of a monochromatic source in the ideal case in the frequency domain there would be one spike dirac delta function at the point of the wavelength emit by the source while for a polychromatic source there would be a number of dirac delta function however in practise the spike have a finite width lead to a spread of wavelength 3 this law describes the relationship between the absolute temperature of a blackbody and the peak wavelength radiation it emits it state that the product of the two quantity be constant where m be the mean wavelength emit by the source and t k be it absolute temperature this show a reciprocal relationship between the two a blackbody be an ideal absorber and emitter of radiation across all wavelength `` an lead be a pn junction whose emission wavelength depends on the band gap of the material use a blackbody radiates at a wavelength dependent only on the temperature of the body and nothing else `` 5 therefore wien 's displacement law be n't applicable to the white and blue lead and will hence only applies to the tungsten source a that u a

mirror on the kinematic stage be manually move to the 0 of it coordinate system align so that it edge line up with the edge of the non-moving part the other mirror be place perpendicularly to it such that the path difference be a close to zero a possible measure use magnetic ruler so that the spectrometer would be set up about the null point more or less because the incident light beam of any source spread out more for longer distance the component of the interferometer be put close together also because the magnetic ruler provide be short the first light source use in order to align the interferometer and search for the null point be a green laser thorlabs at the output port a view screen be initially place instead of the detector in order to see the fringe by eye a combination of lens be use and their placement determine experimentally in order to view the best quality fringe 8 9 for perfectly perpendicular mirror haidinger fringe be observe while fizeau fringe be observe for mirror at an angle in order to search for the null point the haidinger fringe be use such that the centre would be at the detector once the haidinger fringe be obtain the view screen be replace with a detector place such that the centre of the haidinger fringe would be incident at the place of the detector input or a close to that arrangement a possible the detector gain be adjust by a knob such that the max relative intensity could be record but also not too high so that the detector would be saturate visually the null point be where the fringe be the large search for the null point take up an enormous portion of our laboratory time due to problem with alignment and also the speed at which the stage be be move the latter of which be identify quite late the speed at which the stage be move be along order of mm -1 to μms -1 which turn out to be quite important in actually record an interferogram for instance move it a fast a say 1 mm -1 be too fast to record and hence the output interferogram only look like noise with no pattern to it the default sample rate kept throughout the whole experiment be 50 hz the interferogram of the green laser be not what be expect of it ideally the green laser would be a monochromatic source so the interferogram should 've be a perfect continuous sinusoid however there be beating observe meaning that the green laser be actually make up of two or more discrete wavelength fig 2 despite not actually find the null point use the green laser my partner and i at first interpret wrongly that the point where the relative intensity be zero be the null point due to misunderstand the lab script 3 due to our ignorance we move on and begin try to find the null point of the white lead by move it about one of the laser `` null point `` it turn out that again the interferometer be n't align properly so it be plan to go back to the laser instead accidently after move around some of the spectrometer component it be align properly and be at the null point indicate by the white light fringe that be see on the view screen fig 3 that null point be found to be at position -0.297 a typed in the terminal program after the interferograms be plot

accord to the electromagnetic spectrum the visible spectrum range from ∼3 nm to ∼ nm the midpoint of this range be 540 nm which be fairly close to the white lead wavelength the blue lead wavelength be expect to be shorter than this and so it be the white light tungsten source wavelength however be substantially longer than expect it felt hot to the touch so it be hypothesise that the wavelength would be closer to the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum but that clearly be n't the case on the other hand the temperature for the tungsten source accord to wien 's displacement law be relatively high than typical tungsten filament temperature in light bulb 11 suggest the wavelength should by even longer to get the right temperature which in turn suggests that either the hypothesis be incorrect or the tungsten source do n't resemble a blackbody enough so wien 's displacement law be n't applicable to it figure 10 show an interferogram different from the previous one

agreement with an order of magnitude calculation the spectral width value be a predict on the order of ∼ 12 hz the uncertainty in the coherence length have be calculate from the random position error of the kinematic stage illustrate in fig 12 there be also a systematic error in the position which be later correct that be that the kinematic stage be always behind it suppose position in addition to the wobble the latter be the random error source the wobble be a a result of the faulty equipment and therefore could n't be fix during the experiment the uncertainty be found from max deviation from the suppose position and then double for the final coherence length uncertainty the subsequent error be calculate use equation 1 to 3 and standard error formula 10 to summarise the main aim of this experiment be to find out some of the property that characterise different light source in addition to construct a michelson and make it into an ft a well a far understand the application of the fourier transform to this topic the last of which i found to be fairly successful a i now have a much well idea of it conceptually most of the value gotten for the characterisation property be

light proof box be fit around the experiment the light source be swap out for a white lead and the range include the null point be scan over the null point could then be found in a small range by analyse the interferogram the small range allow for more measurement to be take at the null point give more clear result w ith the null point well define measurement could be take with different light

see in figure 6 the average wavelength be found to be 1116±38nm these value be not within error of each other and suggest a large error than consider the tungsten source should display a blackbody spectrum it can be see from figure 5 and 6 that the fourier analyse spectrum be a much bad approximation of a blackbody and so have be discount from this the spectral width in m of 158±11 nm could be

and wavelength analysis be perform due to the stability of the mercury source this wavelength should be very consistent however a see in figure 10 it be not it appear to oscillate this oscillation in

mercury lamp be scan over a longer range than the other source which when combine with the stability of the mercury source be why this fluctuation in wavelength can be more clearly see another problem

69,2ndINT_PUK317_Redacted,a fourier transform spectrometer be construct use a michelson interferometer which produce emission spectrum for a blue and white lead and a white tungsten lamp -along with filter instance of the white light source the spectrum produce be see to be consistent with their expect value however it be determine that in order to evaluate the accuracy of this spectrometer far deeper investigation be require t he michelson interferometer be a simple optical setup comprise of a beam splitter and two mirror by allow the position of one of the mirror to be adjust this system can be use to perform fourier transform spectroscopy use this technique mean that if the output intensity of the interferometer be know a a function of the position of the moveable mirror then the wavelength spectrum of the light enter the interferometer can be determine 1 2 this system set-up will be realise use a motorise mirror and digital detector to allow automate data take for large number of data point the set-up will then collect data for multiple source in order to reconstruct their emission spectrum which will then be compare to the expect value in order to verify the behaviour of the spectrometer a beam of light from a single source can be split into two beam of equal intensity if these beam then travel along identical path before be recombine into a single beam and project onto a detector the intensity at the detector will be equal to the intensity of the original beam of light however if a difference δ path be introduce between the length of the path that the split beam travel before be recombine then it can be show that the intensity at the detector becomes where i be the intensity µ be the amplitude of the electric field for a particular wavenumber σ with σ a the average wavenumber it can be see here how the intensity be form from a superposition of the two beam which have a phase difference of 2πσδ path lead to constructive and destructive interference and that the original source be be described mathematically a a continuous weight sum over all possible wavenumbers 2 the intensity i can be easily measure if the intensity be know a a function of δ path then information about the light source can be recover from the interferogram the fig 1. a schematic diagram of the michelson interferometer use in this report the beam travel through the system be show in red the diffuser show be use in conjunction only with lead source in order to remove the structure that can be see in the beam that them emit which would otherwise lead to non-symmetric data the collimator tube increase the collimation of the light a it travel from source to beam splitter which be make of a partially silver plate and a dielectric plate within a glass block the sliver plate reflect half of incident light and transmits the other half splint light between the arm of the interferometer the dielectric plate cause a phase change of π 4 to light each time it pas through the plate result be a constant additional phase difference of π 2 between the split beam when they be recombine the focus lens converges light onto a single spot on the detector relationship between i and δ path by preform a cosine fourier transform which yield where b be the relative amplitude of a particular wavenumber within the source 's emission spectrum and a be an arbitrary constant in equ 2 b be a sum over all possible path difference up to infinity however due to the continuous nature and finite width of spectral emission line of real source in frequency space it can be see that lim due to the large amount of destructive interference that occurs therefore the contribution of large δ path element to the integral in equ 2 tends to zero and b can be approximate by take the integral form zero to a finite limit 2 iii method in order to split light beam and recombine them in a control fashion a michelson interferometer be employ a show in f ig 1 the linear motor stage that one of the mirror be mount on allows the system to scan through different value of δ path by adjust the value of t which be the offset of the mirror from the position where both interferometer arm will have an equal path length it be therefore know that t 2δ path and that t can have both positive and negative value the detector take measurement of light intensity at a constant rate of 50hz the movement speed of the linear stage be therefore tune to produce an appropriate amount of data point per oscillation in the interferogram if the visible spectrum be approximately 400−700 nm and the stage move at a velocity of 0.0016mms −1 then in the interferogram there will be between 6 and 11 data point per high frequency oscillation depend on the shortest wavelength of light present 1 the value of intensity be take for discrete step in δ path so therefore when equ 2 be implement into the analysis of the measure interferogram a discrete fourier transform be instead use this transform be handle by the scipy discrete fourier transforms package when this transform be implement the 2 term be drop because the dielectric plate present in the interferometer add a constant phase difference between the beam which result in zero intensity at the null point δ path 0 rather than the intensity be that of the original light source instead this offset will result in the spectrum of b σ have a sharp spike at σ 0 which be equivalent to a constant value in the interferogram this spike must be cut out before convert b σ into the wavelength emission spectrum along with negative value of σ which will arise from allow t and effectively therefore δ path to have positive and negative value due to the symmetry in the system it be expect that b σ b −σ 2 iv result three different light source be analyse a blue lead a white lead and a tungsten lamp the latter two source be also analyse after be subject to a yellow filter and a green filer in turn for each data take process the linear stage move 0.1mm with this movement centralise about the current null point of the system this corresponds to δ path range from −0.1mm to +0.1mm example of the observe interferograms be see in f ig 2 with the complete set of reconstruct emission spectrum show in f ig 3 the wide wavelength range produce a narrow interferogram it can be see from the emission spectrum that there be two distinct wavelength peak the expect result of this would be beating effect in the interferogram however the finite interferogram package function cause by spectral width reduces the intensity to a near constant value before this effect can become apparent the two curve in the emission spectrum peak at 441 nm and 563nm with fwhm 's of 30nm and 141nm respectively this spectral shape be an artefact of how white lead work these lead contain a single blue lead the light from this must pa though a phosphor material layer which produce longer wavelength yellow light through fluorescence 3 the spectral shape correspond to the fluorescence be naturally wider than to lead that cause it because there be effectively a convolution between the distribution of wavelength incident on the phosphor and the pre-existing distribution of electron energy within the phosphor which shape the distribution of fluoresce light the blue lead produce a wider interferogram than the two white source because the spectrum have a narrower wavelength range the interferogram be still contain within a discrete package because the spectral line be not infinity narrow the peak wavelength be 479 nm with a fwhm of 29 nm the expect wavelength be 470 nm which be consistent with the obtain result 4 a with the white lead the board range of wavelength present in tungsten light result in a narrow image on the interferogram unlike any of the other source however the recover spectrum show that there be wavelength present which lie outside of the visible range into the infra red the spectral curve peak at 788 nm with a fwhm of 278 nm it be know that a tungsten lamp produce light through thermal emission therefore by treat the tungsten a a black body it temperature can be predict use wien 's displacement law where t be the colour temperature and λ max be the peak wavelength in the emission spectrum use this the temperature of the tungsten be predict to be 3680k however the lamp be rat a have a colour temperature of 2796k from this discrepancy it can be conclude that the detector use in this set-up be not sufficient to detect a wide enough range of ir light to fully reconstruct the emission spectrum which for tungsten would be mostly in the ir the decay signal response to longer wavelength be what have cause to spectrum to appear to peak at a shorter wavelength result in a high predict value of temperature 5 it can be see that the spectral width of the filter emission spectrum be small enough that the beating effect cause by the multiple peak can be see on the interferogram before the package function reduces the intensity to a near constant the filter green and yellow filter use in this report be bandpass filter with a central wavelength of 543.5 nm and 580 nm respectively with a fwhm of 10 nm the distinct and consistent spectrum profile that both of these filter produce be therefore unexpected the size of this profile be consistent between filter and source however with a white lead source the green and yellow spectral profile be offset by ∼ 30 nm but with a tungsten source this offset increase to ∼ 50 nm this change be also unexpected and unexplained the experimental set-up have be show to able to reconstruct emission spectrum whose nature be consistent with the expect result however the accuracy of this reconstruction can not be meaningfully comment on without multiple and repeat measurement over a wider range of source in order to facilitate proper error analysis it have also be see with the tungsten lamp that this system be limited by the response of the detector to different wavelength of light meaning that for proper treatment of source which emit light outside of the visible spectrum a different detector would need to be implement this same limitation also lead to different wavelength of visible light invoke different signal response from the detector to produce accurate emission spectrum this effect must be understood though far experimentation so that it can be account for the consistent emission profile of filter source that be found in this report demonstrate that this set-up be capable of produce repeatable data however the shape and position of these profile be not explain the linear stage velocity that be use to collect data be found to be satisfactory throughout 2 for a white lead a blue

beam be 2t however for an observer look from an angle θ to the normal of the mirror the path difference be actually 2dcosθ if the distance traverse by the two beam differs by an integer number of wavelength λ we expect constructive interference hence a bright fringe whereas if the distance differs by an integer multiple of λ/2 we expect destructive interference however the dielectric plate on one side of the beam-splitter cause a phase change therefore produce a dark fringe at zero path difference instead the adjustable tilt of m 1 determines the type of fringe produce when interference occurs if m 1 and m 2 be parallel it be equivalent to the source be in line with each other this cylindrical symmetry cause the characteristic circular haidinger fringe to form a show in the right diagram of fig 2. if m 1 be inclined and intersects with m 2 the straight line fringe also call fizeau fringe be distinguishable at the detector these be contour of the wedge between the first mirror and the image of the second mirror reflect in the beam-splitter however if mirror be inclined and do not intersect the resultant fringe be curve section of hyperbola 2 a show in the middle diagram of fig 2. the interferogram record a fourier transform of the spectral line shape from a frequency domain to a spatial domain in frequency space the monochromatic wave be a delta function if the source emits light with two frequency the separation of these frequency relates to the spread of the null in the sequence of bright and dark fringe on the interferogram this spread be inversely proportional to the separation of the frequency hence a wide spectral width in the spatial domain form due to a narrow spectral width in the frequency domain 3 the spectral line be a fingerprint that can be use to identify atom a it presence indicates the idea of discrete energy level the spectral line shape of a lamp be approximately gaussian where it should ideally be a dirac delta function however spectral line broadening occurs this be due to heisenberg 's uncertainty principle which state there will be an intrinsic uncertainty in the energy of photon release by an atom -a natural spread of photon energy around the spectral line that form the gaussian shape another reason for the gaussian shape can be thermal doppler broadening cause by thermal vibration of the electron which change the observe frequency a more appropriate model for spectral line be the voigtian function 3 which be define by the convolution of a gaussian and lorentzian function we use the linux operating system to simulate the output expect from a light source with a specify width of the gaussian profile and an arbitrary intensity this simulation corroborate the theory that broadening the spectral line width in frequency domain narrow the separation of the null point in the interferogram and this be depict in fig 3. furthermore we use the the program to simulate interferograms with white blue and green light source a portrayed in fig 4. the spatial width of the white light simulation be much narrower than both blue and green light this occurs a there be a large range of frequency present in the white light spectrum whereas the range of wavelength for blue and green light be small fast fourier transforms ffts be perform on these interferograms obtain from the simulation give the spectrum in wavelength domain and validate the expect wavelength for the respective light source when construct the interferometer we use a lens of focal length 24.5mm before the beam-splitter so light from the green laser focus on the it after the beam split and recombine we place a lens of focal length 100mm before the detector to diverge the laser light if multiple fringe be incident on the aperture of the detector the signal of the peak would cancel the signal of the trough make it necessary to diverge the beam the mirror m 2 be on a stage it position be control by a motor connect to the computer along with the photodiode detector the detector sample at a rate of 50hz a a default align the interferometer be one of the most important procedure a the quality of data depends on it to ensure the interferometer align well we checked for constructive interference a large distance from the detector if circular haidinger fringe be produce here then it would definitely be well-aligned at the detector we use the green laser a a tool to find the null point the position of m 2 where t 0. when the stage be move slowly the fringe appear or disappear from the centre depend on whether we scan away or towards the null point meaning the null point be situate where the fringe change direction then scan through with a white lead confirm this range to be 8.073 − 8.085 ± 0.0005mm we select the range of position to scan through the speed and the number of sample take depend on the expect interferogram width of the respective light source there be four light source that we characterise in this experiment white lead blue lead white tungsten light and white tungsten light with a green filter another point to note about the tungsten lamp when the fit function be apply the fit wavelength belong in the infrared region hence it can be model a a black body emitter use wein 's displacement law the temperature t have a value of 5040 ± 1000k this be the correct order of magnitude for a tungsten lamp we apply ffts to the interferograms to transform them from a spatial domain to a wavelength domain this give gaussian-like shape for the distribution of the wavelength from which the average wavelength be calculate the spread of wavelength for white lead be show in fig 7. this be expect because white lead comprises blue/uv light along with yellow light from fluorescence 4 the small peak corresponds to approximately 360nm which lie in the uv range and the large peak corresponds to 500nm which be closer to the yellow range wavelength to work out the coherence length l we fit a gaussian over the interferogram and use the relationship to find the full-width half maximum fwhm which be an approximation for the coherence length of the source in order to obtain the value present in table i and table ii we take five interferograms of each of the light source this reduces the chance of anomaly in the data when the average be take the value of the error be also low because the sample size be high the error in the average wavelength arise from the analysis of the fit function and spread of the fit wavelength to the interferogram the error in the coherence length can be determine by how appropriate the gaussian fit be for an interferogram and the error in the σ value for the fit the gaussian fit best on the tungsten lamp interferogram and it be the least appropriate for the tungsten lamp with a green filter this be because the green frequency emit be close in frequency space which cause beating form the shape outside the central envelope also because the gaussian be not a good fit for the spectral line this be illustrate in fig 8. the bandwidth theorem and the relationship between the frequency bandwidth and coherence time 5 rearranges to where ∆ν be the frequency bandwidth in unit of hz this can be rearrange to calculate the spectral width in the wavelength domain also the error in table ii be calculate use propagation of error formula from the l value the white lead and white tungsten lamp have a similar spectral width in the frequency space however it differs significantly in wavelength space -showing that the tungsten lamp be more of a continuous spectrum the blue and green filter tungsten lamp have narrower spectral width a they consist of more distinct frequency hence give them large coherence length v. conclusion this experiment give the spectral width of white lead and white tungsten lamp a 27.6 ± 13.1nm and 45.1 ± 3.9nm respectively whereas for blue lead and a tungsten lamp with green filter they be 4.7 ± 1.3nm and 2.3 ± 0.8nm respectively compare this to the interferograms the reciprocity between spatial domain and frequency wavelength domain be far solidify the main source of error be most likely the limitation of the light source and stray light create noise in interferograms,superficial,the,65,0.362057328,0.637942672
4,2ndINT_HBQ145_Redacted,michelson interferometer with a movable mirror be use to find the null point of three different light source blue lead white lead and tungsten broadband light source the interferograms obtain be fourier transform to show the spectrum of wavelength present for the blue lead a peak wavelength at 480 ± 20 nm be found a expect in the blue region of the visible for the white lead the spectrum cover the entirety of the visible with two peak at ∼ 410 nm and ∼ 520 nm indicate that the white light be primarily make of two colour for the tungsten source a gaussian-like peak be observe rather than a black body spectrum protrude far into infrared this be explain by the drop in spectral sensitivity of the detector at wavelength great than red c onverting interference pattern from lead and black body source into a spectrum of their constituent wavelength be useful when understand the physic of semiconductor and the quantum nature of light for an lead the spectrum can give some indication of the band gap size in the semiconductor a for a black body source the temperature of the source can be determine from it spectrum this experiment will make use of a michelson interferometer to combine beam of light from a source to produce an interference pattern on a detector fig 1. schematic of a michelson interferometer light be split into two beam which reflect off mirror and recombine 1 the distribution of these fringe contains information about the source 's spectrum the objective of this experiment be to produce interferograms of a blue lead white lead and a heat tungsten source then use fourier transforms to convert the interferograms into a spectrum reveal the structure of the light emit from the source in reference to fig 2 the beam splitter separate incoming light into two beam with reduce amplitude via partial reflection 2 the two light beam travel along different arm of the interferometer and be reflect by the plane mirror m1 and m2 let the image of m2 be label m2 a distance t away from the plane mirror m1 3 after reflect off the mirror the beam recombine at the beam splitter for two monochromatic beam of wavelength λ the result of this recombination will either be destructive or constructive interference depend on the path difference between them if m1 and m2 be parallel beam inclined at angle θ to the normal of the mirror appear to be come from infinity and thus exhibit cylindrical symmetry produce circular fringe 1 the path difference between two inclined beam incident not parallel and hence m2 be tilt vertical fringe will be observe call fizeau fringe in this experiment we will be use haidinger fringe if m1 can be translate along the axis of it surface normal we can change the arm length of the michelson interfeormeter and therefore we can also change the path difference of the beam incident on the detector a the intensity of the recombine beam be dependent on the path difference ∆ we can use fourier analysis to transform the intensity spectrum i ∆ to yield a distribution i σ dependent on wavenumber σ. wavenumber be inverse wavelength and can be use to infer the wavelength present in the light 4 for a monochromatic light source and two beam of equal amplitude we can write the electric field amplitude of the combine beam in complex form a e c e 0 exp iωt e 0 exp i ωt δ therefore the intensity of the combine beam be where i 0 be a constant 4 now consider an incoherent light source that be not monochromatic let u also attribute some spectral distribution i σ to this source the total intensity be now the sum of all the intensity contribution of each of the different wavenumbers present this result be to within a constant the fourier cosine transform and thus we have show i ∆ f i σ 4 if we have a light source with a gaussian wavenumber distribution the fourier transform will also be a gaussian distribution in fig 4 a gaussian line be simulated the fourier transform show in fig 5 have a gaussian envelope and be maximum at the nullpoint the position of zero path difference hidden due to the resolution of the image be the high frequency oscillation correspond to the passing of light and dark fringe on the detector a would be observe by a michelson interferometer the michelson interferometer set-up be show in fig 6. to observe haidinger fringe with a green laser optical device be at the same height and the beam be align by adjust m2 such that the spot of green light at the detector be perfectly superpose and that the beam be incident at the centre of both mirror when use the laser source a lens be insert to produce a sharper fringe pattern on the detector the arm distance be suitably large to ensure that the fringe be large than the detector if the fringe be small than the detector measurement of average light intensity would be make which be undesirable when try to discern between light and dark fringe when use the lead a ground glass diffuser be use instead of lens to reduce the anisotropy of light emit the whole system sits on an optical bench however it be still susceptible to external vibration so any human contact with the table whilst take measurement be avoid mirror m1 be situate on a movable stage to vary the path difference the detector be connect to a computer and measurement of relative amplitude be measure a a motor move m1 the null-point be the position of zero path difference which corresponds to t 0. the intensity profile of which be fourier transform to examine the spectrum of the source to find it the green laser 's haidinger fringe be first obtain and then m1 be move in such a direction a to decrease the number of fringe this be do by eye the reason for reduce the number of fringe be because a separation t be reduce for a give fringe order m the radius of the circular fringe decrease to increase the value of co θ 3 at the centre co θ 1 and thus we can write 2t mλ we can see that fringe order decrease by 1 when 2d change by λ and hence the fringe vanish at the centre a the null-point be approach 2 once a region of minimal fringe be determine the green laser be switch for an lead or tungsten source depend on the source under investigation the motor be then programmed to scan slowly through this region at 0.001 mm/s such a speed in conjunction with the high detector sample rate of 50hz be suitable when find the null-point which be highly localise and easily miss the null-point be found and the signal see fig 7 have an approximately gaussian envelope therefore a gaussian be fit to the fourier transform see fig 8 the peak wavelength occurs at 480 ± 20 nm this lie within the range of 450 − 495nm for blue light 5 the null-point for white lead be show in fig 9. there be an asymmetry in this signal a if there be two null point we postulate this be due to two peak of different amplitude in the white lead 's spectrum the fourier transform see fig 10 reveals the spectrum occupy the entire visible spectrum spectrum a expect from a white light source however there be two primary peak situate in the region of approximately 410 nm and 520 nm or violet and green/yellow light respectively this indicates that the white lead primarily consists of two colour which we still perceive a white light the tungsten null-point fig 11 be more localise and symmetric than the white light 's suggest a broader and smoother spectrum of wavelength the correspond fourier transform be show in fig 12. this should be a black body spectrum but it be not a the tungsten heat up thermal motion of bound electron emit a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation we have not detect most of this black body spectrum due to the spectral sensitivity distribution of the silicon pin photodiode detector see fig 13 the spectral sensitivity cutoff in the infrared in no or little light be detect at wavelength great than that of visible and this be what we observe a cut-off of wavelength great than and around 1000 nm the aim of the experiment be to set-up and use a michelson interferometer to obtain interferograms of null point of various light source and use fourier transforms to show the constituent wavelength of light emit from the source the blue lead have a very symmetrical null point signal the gaussian fit to the fourier transform data place the peak wavelength at 480 ± 20 nm within the blue regime of the visible spectrum the white light have a more asymmetric null point the spectrum of which span the visible spectrum with two large peak the two peak of light be thought to give rise to the asymmetry of the null point the tungsten source spectrum be expect to be that reminiscent of a black body however due to the spectral sensitivity of the detector infrared light be lose cut the spectrum short this experiment could be improve in the follow way firstly far analysis of null point could be do for example the coherence length of the source can be estimate by measure the width of the null point envelope from this spectral width of the gaussians could be found to far characterise the light source secondly the spectral sensitivity function could be approximate a a triangle and use to deconvolute our measure signal to recover the original black body spectrum this would allow one to make a meaningful estimation of the temperature of the tungsten source use wein 's law furthermore an error not account for in this experiment be that of the motor speed this could be investigate by move the stage through large distance several time with the green laser and try to reproduce the same distance travel,deep,none,70,0.386159986,0.613840044
10,2ndINT_XUQ367_Redacted,in this experiment we use a michelson interferometer to determine the spectrum of a white lead a blue lead tunsten light source with a green and yellow filter and a mercury discharge lamp the spectrum have gaussian fit to them to measure mean wavelength and the standard deviation be estimate to calculate coherence length the white lead have a mean wavelength of 506.8 ± 0.5nm with a coherence length of 2.48 ± 0.01μm and the blue lead have a mean wavelength of 470.1 ± 0.1nm with a coherence length of 5.36 ± 0.9μm the tungsten light source with a green and yellow filter have a mean wavelength of 542.5 ± 1nm and 577.4 ± 1nm respectively with coherence length of 5.36 ± 0.12μm and 4.58 ± 0.18μm respectively the mercury discharge lamp have a mean wavelength of 512.2 ± 0.8nm with a coherence length of 5.01 ± 0.5μm in this experiment we be investigate different light source by analyse their interferograms use a michelson interferometer interferometry be an important technique that have be use throughout science to prove fundamental theory in physic such a detect gravitation wave to disprove that light travel through an ether the interferometer work by partially splitting a beam of light and recombines them at the beam splitter the light will interfere at the beam splitter cause an interference pattern by investigate the interference pattern around the null point of the interferometer with a photometer a wave profile can be make for each of the light source by use fourier analysis the data obtain can be use to calculate spectral width of the source wavelength of the source and therefore coherence length to characterise the different light source the light source use be a white lead blue lead tungsten lamp with a yellow and a green filter and a mercury discharge lamp a diagram of the michelson interferometer be show below in figure 1. when the light beam split the reflect can travel in either two path path s1 or path s2 the beam splitter be make up of a partially silver surface and a dialectic plate that cause a phase change in the s2 beam if the path difference between s1 and s2 be an integer multiple of the wavelength of the light destructive interference would occur due to the dielectric plate cause a phase change when the wave recombine the amplitude of the recombine light can be give by equation 1. where e be the amplitude of light ωis the angular frequency of light t be time σis the wave number of the light wave i.e 1/wavelength and d be the path difference between the interfere light beam however the photometer do not measure amplitude directly but intensity instead intensity of any wave be give by the modulus square of the amplitude of the wave thus the intensity for a particular value of σis give by equation 2. it should be note that the amplitude e be a function of σ a the light source will have vary wavelength and hence vary the density of wave number σis related to the fourier transform of the interferogram record 2 where i d be intensity of light a a function of path difference between the interfere light source the full derivation of this be in appendix a. the intensity of light detect depends upon the interference pattern observe with the interferometer follow a gaussian distribution due to the fact that two interfere light source interfere a wave packet this mean that the fourier transform return another gaussian distribution and hence spectral width of the source can be calculate from equation 4 ∆ν c λ 2 ∆λ 4 where δλis the spectral width of the light source c be the speed of light λis the wavelength of the light source and δλis the wavelength width spectral width of a light source can be use to calculate coherence length coherence length be a measure of the distance over which one arm of a michelson interferometer can be scan before the interferogram visibility becomes poor citation the coherence length can be calculate from equation 5. where l be the coherence length in the case of interference pattern two type of fringe can occur if the mirror be align such that they be at exact right angle to each other and to the surface the interfere light source appear to come from an infinite distance away cause circular fringe if one mirror be at an angle in respect to the other mirror fizau fringe occur which appear more linear the equation govern the angle be give by equation 6. where t be the seperation of the mirror θis the respective angle m be the order of interference which be an integer and be the wavelength of light the null point be when t=0 a more define interferogram can be take by scan over the null point and be therefore important to the experiment the interferometer be set up on a stable stage so that the optical element could be fix we make sure that the mirror be at approximately equal length it do not need to be precise a mirror 2 move on a translational stage to find the null point a laser be use a the light source in the interferometer a convex lens be attach at the recombination point at the beam splitter which have a focal length of 24.5mm the photometer be move out of the way of the beam and a screen be place at a distance away from the beam splitter mirror 1 be adjust until haidinger fringe appear by move mirror 2 slowly the circular fringe will either appear to be move inwards or outwards depend on the direction of movement of mirror 2. the null point be the point at which the ring change direction from move inwards to outwards or vice-versa the haidinger fringe be difficult to notice with the light source use in the investigation unless close to the null point therefore the green laser be use a the fringe pattern be much more noticeable at distance just over 10mm away from the null point a precise figure for our null point can not be give a it change depend on each laboratory session due to external influence move the optical element once the null point be found the green laser be carefully remove so that the beam splitter do not move and the light source be put in place anomalous result can be cause by stray ray interfere with the ray that go through the beam splitter this be reduce by place the light source in a matte black tube that collimate the light source and matte black card place towards the end of this tube to far reduce stray ray the interferogram be measure by vary the distance move by mirror 2 over small distance of roughly 0.25mm the interferogram be measure by the photometer and the data be record directly to a computer that can process the data to a fourier transform safety precaution have to be make when use the different light source when handle the green laser it be important not to shine any light directly into someone 's eye include the interference pattern light furthermore the mercury discharge lamp also emits uv light which be ionise and can cause blindness to avoid the danger of uv safety goggles be worn when the lamp be turn on to avoid effect of uv exposure to our eye a white lead be make from a blue lead with a yellow phosphor therefore 2 gaussian distribution should be observe from the fourier transform the interferogram of the white lead be asymmetrical due to misalignment of the interferometer this can affect the result but not to a substantial degree of accuracy the spectrum show two spectral line that be in a gaussian distribution the peak wavelength of the blue spectral line be 445.3 ± 0.2nm with a standard deviation of 10.4 ± 0.2nm and the peak wavelength of the yellow phosphor spectral line be 562.8 ± 0.2nm with a standard deviation of 55.5 ± 1nm the latter spectral line be just above the boundary of the yellow-green spectrum so can therefore be except a a non anomalous result the value be obtain by use computer optimisation that also return value for the uncertainty in peak wavelength the mean wavelength of the whole lead be calculate by use amplitude a a weight factor in the mean which be calculate to be 506.8±0.5nm the standard deviation be use to calculate the spectral width meaning that δλ= 24.5 ± 0.9 for the blue part of the spectrum and δλ= 103.7 ± 1nm for the yellow part of the spectrum this give a combine δλof 128.2±2nm from 4 we calculate δνto be 121.0±1thz then use 3 the coherence length be calculate to be 2.48 ± 0.01 μm next we analyse the blue lead the interferogram and fourier transform be show in figure 4 and 5 respectively the blue lead have a gaussian peak at 470.1±0.1nm with a standard deviation of 20.3 ± 0.1nm this meant that the δλfor the blue lead be 20.3 ± 0.1 result in a value for δνto be calculate at 27.5 ± 0.3thz therefore the coherence length be 5.36 ± 0.9μm we analyse the tungsten light source with a green filter and a yellow filter the interferogram for the green filter tungsten light be show below the interferogram pattern show in figure 6 be due to the nature of the filter the green filter transmits light in gaussian form with a peak wavelength of 543.5 ± 2nm with a standard deviation of 4.2 ± 0.8nm 4 this mean that the result interferogram be a resultant of a convolution with the filter and the tungsten light source from figure 7 we fit a single gaussian curve and two separate gaussian curve the peak wavelength of the single gaussian curve be found to be 539.9 ± 1.2nm and the mean wavelength of the two gaussian curve be found to be 542.5 ± 1.1nm the two mean wavelength be similar so it be possible that these two peak be due to a small misalignment that cause the interferogram of the white light it could also be cause by distance between sample take be too large this be also cause the single gaussian peak to have a small amplitude a all the point be use in the optimisation however the amplitude do not affect the mean wavelength for the single peak the mean wavelength from the two gaussian peak would leave out the dip in the fourier transform therefore if we assume that the dip be an anomalous result the mean wavelength of 542.5 ± 1nm would be more accurate from use the two gaussian peak a our accepted result the spectral width be found to be 55.9 ± 0.2thz use 5 we obtain a value of 5.36 ± 0.12μm the result for the tungsten light with the yellow filter be show below the interferogram for the tungsten light source with the yellow filter have a similar shape to the tungsten light source with the green filter for the same reason again a single gaussian fit do not seem appropriate but from analysis of the other two curve the mean wavelength be calculate to be 577.4 ± 1nm the spectral width be calculate to be 65.5 ± 0.2thz which obtains a coherence length of 4.58 ± 0.18μm the error give for the tungsten light source for the wavelength be give by the fit for the curve however these error may not be the true value of the error a the two peak fit for the tungsten light source be not a accurate a the other fit for the white lead and blue lead the final light source that be observe and scan around the null point be the mercury discharge lamp the interferogram do not have a distinct gaussian peak this be due to the fact that mercury lamp have many spectral line two different curve be fit to the spectrum of the mercury lamp to investigate the appearance of a doublet in 500-600nm part of the mercury lamp spectrum the initial parameter of the optimisation be change in order to identify any doublet however the mercury spectral line be not distinct which make it difficult to identify the doublet from the curve fit with two peak the mean wavelength be calculate to be 512.2 ± 0.8nm with a δλof 54.4 ± 0.7nm therefore the spectral width be calculate to be 5.99 ± 0.7thz with a coherence length of 5.01 ± 0.5μm.it be know that mercury emits light in the uv spectrum despite this no light be detect in the uv range this be because the photometer detects light within a certain range of wavelength this be discus far in the appendix concern the derivation of the fourier transform v. conclusion in this experiment we be use a michelson interferometer to determine the spectrum and coherence length of different light source this be do by measure the signal of the interfere beam and obtain an interferogram for the light source a fourier transform of the interferogram make a spectrum for the light source so that coherence length can be calculate the white lead and blue lead have spectrum 's that have gaussian curve which be a expect however the tungsten lamp with the filter do not have a strong gaussian fit this could be due to misalignment but be be more likely that the sample rate be not high enough affect the fourier transform obtain if the tungsten experiment be to be repeat again a high sample rate would obtain a well spectrum for tungsten light with the filter the mercury lamp interferogram be not distinctive due to the fact that mercury have many more spectral line than lead however the fourier transform return a two peak that be relatively gaussian which meant that calculation could be perform if the whole experiment be to be repeat each interferogram should be measure more than once to obtain an average in order to reduce random error word count:2290

40,2ndINT_WFX625_Redacted,in this paper we investigate four different light source range from white to monochromatic and lead to incandescent lamp we predict and measure the spectrogram of these source and use fourier transforms to determine the wavelength that make up the various light source we calculate the mean wavelength and coherence length of the various source a well a the spectral width in frequency and wavelength space he interferometer be a powerful instrument use in many application in physic base on the simple principle of use mirror to produce interference pattern we can extract information from an everyday light source such a an lead or incandescent lamp use fourier transforms we be able to understand that light be n't simply one single wavelength be emit but rather a spectrum of wavelength all be emit to build up the colour we see with the naked eye use idea about the beating phenomenon that occurs with two similar frequency we be able to build up an idea a simulation on what we might expect from these different light source the interferometer allows u to make very small precise change and extract information by use the principle of interference by splitting a single beam of a light source into two individual beam we can reflect the beam and allow them to interact and interfere with each other the path difference between the two beam determine by the position of our two mirror will decide the interference pattern we observe if the distance the two beam travel be exactly the same then we expect to observe a constructive interference pattern any slight displacement of any of the two mirror will disrupt this pattern since we be deal with visible light the wavelength we be work with be on the order of 10 -7 m and a displacement of exactly λ/4 since the light have to travel to the mirror and back this be equivalent to a path difference of λ\2 where λ be the wavelength will result in destructive interference we can use a photodiode detector to observe and measure the interference pattern a we displace one of the mirror we also know that visually the constructive and destructive interference can be see by bright and dark fringe respectively the michelson interferometer show in fig 1 u a partially-silvered mirror know a a beamsplitter to split a beam from a light source into two the two beam carry on to their respective mirror and reflect back to the beamsplitter where they recombine and reflect towards the detector if the relative displacement between the two mirror t be equal to zero than normally we would observe perfect constructive interference however we introduce a dielectric plate on the beamsplitter to cause a phase change of π in one of the beam so we observe destructive interference instead when deal with monochromatic laser source we must consider the fact that the resultant light be actually a spectrum of multiple wavelength in frequency space we would expect a monochromatic wave to be a single delta function if we examine what happens with two delta function i.e light built up of two distinct frequency we begin to observe a beating pattern the intensity of the interferogram be modulate and the sequence of bright and dark fringe alternate between minimum and maximum amplitude it can be show that the degree of modulation depends on ν2 -ν1 the difference between the two frequency 1 the small this difference be the great the modulation a show in fig 2 in reality we deal with more than two distinct frequency first of all due to heisenberg 's uncertainty principle there will always be some uncertainty and variation in the energy of the photon release by the excite electron furthermore the thermal vibration of the electron cause a phenomenon know a thermal doppler broadening which contributes even more variation to the frequency we now opt to consider the frequency in the form of a gaussian distribution rather than a delta function in this case we can consider the spectral line width 2 of the gaussian to be similar to ν2 -ν1 i.e the small the width the longer the interferogram a show in fig 3 when simulate our interferograms we now have a well idea of what it will look like a monochromatic light will have a narrower distribution of frequency compare to white light in order to use the interferometer a a spectrometer i.e a device to measure the property of light we must be able to reliably and consistently produce interferograms in the area of maximum constructive interference the null point be the point at which the path difference between the two split light beam be exactly zero i.e t equal to zero and we will get a maximum intensity on our detector a we displace one of our mirror we must take several precaution when try to obtain the null point a it require careful alignment of the two mirror if we introduce any sort of relative angle of tilt between the two mirror we begin to observe the fringe a straight line know a fizeau fringe a show in fig 4 at value of t where the mirror do n't intersect the fringe start to curve a section of hyperbolae which would then result in inconsistency in the intensity measure by the detector 3 we must therefore take care in ensure the two mirror be parallel to produce collimate beam of light a well a circular fringe know a haidinger fringe this be important for our spectrogram a it allows u to produce consistent spectrogram with different light source without any unexpected variation in intensity it should be dependent solely on the path difference in order to determine the characteristic of the different light source we examine we measure the relative displacement of the mirror from the null point and the intensity of the light on the detector since the movement of the mirror and the detector act independently we must set both of them up to take reasonable data sample across the displacement range the detector be fix at 50hz i.e it can take 50 data sample every second the mirror mount on a moveable stage have a variable speed in mm/s which we can control therefore we need to make sure that number of data sample the detector take be enough to cover the entire range of displacement of the stage another precaution we must take be to make sure the stage do n't move too fast a the mechanical vibration cause by the movement can disturb the interference pattern to try and obtain a reasonable compromise between take enough data and minimize the time take for the measurement we opt to move the stage at speed on the order of 10 -7 m/s and around 10 3 data point once we have our data we can use fourier transforms to extract important information from our spectrogram this allows u to see more clearly the different wavelength that make up our light source and compare the gaussian in wavelength space of our light source and that of the simulation the spectral width be give by where δ𝜐 be the spectral width measure in hertz l be the coherence length the distance over which the spectrogram display coherence and c be the speed of light since we be fourier transform into wavelength space it be more helpful to consider the spectral width in term of wavelength we can use the equation where λ be the mean wavelength of the gaussian and δ𝜆 be the spectral width in term of wavelength to determine the coherence length of each light source we can consider full width half max fwhm of a gaussian fit to the spectrogram a show in fig 5 give by where σ be the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution the four light source we investigate and simulated be a white lead blue lead tungsten white lamp and the tungsten lamp with a green filter after we fit the gaussian to the spectrogram and determine the mean wavelength we can use 1 2 and 3 to determine the spectral width and compare them with our expect value from our simulation first of all we simulated the white lead by consider the average wavelength of the visible electromagnetic spectrum around 550nm and the spectral width equal to the range of the visible spectrum around 300nm this would suggest that all of the wavelength across the visible spectrum be emit simultaneously when in reality the white lead consists of mainly ultraviolet from the ingan material inside and yellow from phosphor wavelength the fourier transform a show in fig the blue lead be easy to simulate we can consider the average wavelength for blue light around 470nm and equate the spectral width to the range of blue light roughly 40nm in this case the blue lead consists of solely the blue wavelength lead to a relatively narrow spectral width and large coherence length a show in fig result for the four light source white and blue lead and the tungsten lamp with and without the green filter there be a clear pattern in spectral width with narrower spectral width be measure for monochromatic light source a predict the tungsten lamp emits light by heating a wire filament of tungsten to the point where it emits visible light since it relies on be heat up we expect the thermal doppler broadening to impact the spectral width more than with the lead furthermore our simulation for white light in fig 6 be a more accurate model of the tungsten lamp since it do emit a continuous spectrum rather than two distinct frequency the mean wavelength be also much closer to the average wavelength of the visible spectrum compare to the white lead a show in fig 8 since the green filter only allows green light through we can simulate green light use a wavelength of around 540nm and spectral width of about 40nm the result spectrogram produce a relatively long coherence length and narrow spectral width a show in fig 9 the mean wavelength be also much closer to our simulation a the green filter would not allow any other frequency of visible light through the green filter also introduces another effect the fourier transform in fig 9 show three peak all within the green range of wavelength which have be let through this result in a beating pattern which can be observe on the end of the spectrogram but which be not account for in the simulation the main source of error will be in the setup of the interferometer the michelson interferometer be a very powerful tool but also very sensitive and require a extremely high level of precision when be set up irregularity and slight lack of symmetry in the spectrogram reveals this error furthermore since the intensity of some of the light source we use be very low the signal start to become noisy and interference pattern become harder to obtain finally the fit for the spectrogram should not quite be consider to be gaussian the voigtian function be a convolution of the lorentzian and gaussian function and be more appropriate a it combine the idea of the thermal doppler broadening characterize by the gaussian function with the spectral line characterize by the lorentzian function 4 although the peak be the same the voigtian function account for the inaccuracy of the gaussian in the wing of the function a show in fig 5 improve the fit function will enable u to improve our estimate for the fwhm and therefore the spectral width of our light source we have be able to display a parallel between the theoretical simulation of light source and their respective spectrogram use a michelson interferometer use fourier transforms we have show that white light source whilst appear similar can be in fact construct from completely different wavelength and have drawn far parallel between the width of our gaussian simulation and what we 'd expect from the fourier transforms use the full width half max of a fit gaussian to our spectrogram we be able to establish a relationship between the coherence length of a light source and it spectral width there be still many improvement to be make both to the experimental procedure and the approach in analysis to far improve the match between simulation and

the wavelength range of their respective colour in light 's visible spectrum the spectral width value calculate be meaningful because their associate uncertainty be small the spectral width of white

because their associate uncertainty be small in addition the calculate value of spectral width be approximately equal to the width of the gaussian on the fourier transform plot for each light source show that the spectral width value be reasonable it be note that the interferogram of the blue lead source be wider than that of white light the blue lead therefore have a narrower spectral line than

39,2ndINT_GEI074_Redacted,in this experiment a michelson interferometer be construct and implement a a fourier transform spectrometer to characterize and investigate several different light source the spectrum of white light from an lead and tungsten source be generate a well a for a blue lead the interferometer could be use to characterize general feature of the the source such a the peak wavelength and spectral width however accurate numerical value be unable to be determine due to some unquantifiable uncertainty with the experimental set-up and procedure interferometry be a technique use to provide information on electromagnetic wave by analyze superposition phenomenon such a interference the michelson interferometer be invent by a.michelson in the late 19th century and use in the renowned michelson-morley experiment of 1887 which disprove the theory of the luminifeorus aether which be believe to be the medium for the propagation of light 1 the michelson interferometer induces interference by splitting a light beam into two part which travel along the two arm of the interferometer when they be recombine the path difference between the two component of the beam lead to interference effect which be use to provide information about the source the michelson interferometer be an extremely precise instrument a it be able to measure distance of the same order of magnitude a the wavelength of the light source in this experiment the michelson interferometer be assemble in such a way that it can be use a a spectrometer -a device that determines the constituent wavelength of light source when a michelson interferometer be use in such a way it be know a a fourier transform spectrometer the michelson interferometer set-up be show in figure 1. light from the source can travel along one of two orthogonal arm of the interferometer the first path label a be where light reflect by the beamsplitter travel to the movable mirror m1 the second path label b be the path of the transmit beam which travel to the fix mirror m2 when the two beam be reflect back to the beam-splitter they recombine and be direct towards the detector which pick up the interference pattern the interference pattern observe be dependent on the path difference the difference in path length along the arm be label t in the diagram so the overall path difference be 2t the dielectric plate cause a λ 2 phase change for one of the split beam of light which result in the production of a dark fringe due to destructive interference when there be no path difference 2 the null point be when the distance travel by the two beam be equal i.e t 0. when use the interferometer a a spectrometer collimate plane wave from the source be scan by the detector after produce an interference pattern due to the movement of the mirror m2 the series of bright and dark fringe produce around the null point be able to be record electronically by the detector it be possible by processing the interference pattern use a fast fourier transform fft to recover the original waveform of the source and obtain the spectrum show the constituent wavelength due to the nondispersive nature of air a monochromatic wave such a light from a laser will produce a continuous series of bright and dark fringe which appear a a delta function when an fft be perform on it monochromatic light have a high coherence length a it be make up of one wavelength of light 3 most light source consist of multiple wavelength of light meaning that the interference pattern be modulate furthermore white light consists of all wavelength in the visible spectrum so have a small coherence length practically this mean that only a few fringe of white light will be observe at the null point which be why it be important to accurately determine it location this be because only at the null point be the fringe pattern for each wavelength component in phase the spectral feature of light source can be approximate a gaussian meaning that the temporal feature be also gaussian therefore a gaussian can be fit to the interferograms obtain in order to approximate the coherence length the standard deviation of the gaussian σ be the coehrence length l. the relation between the frequency spectral width ∆ν and l be give by the spectral width have unit of frequency but this can be convert into a wavelength 4 the interferometer be construct consist of 2 mirror a beam-splitter detector and source one of the mirror be fix whilst the second one be mount on a stage which be control by a computer the detector be also plug into the computer to record data a schematic diagram of the experimental setup be show in figure 1. the two mirror be set up with roughly equal space a green laser be use to align the mirror such that haidinger fringe be observe on a screen place in front of the detector this only occur when the two mirror be exactly perpendicular to each other only the fix mirror could be adjust finely so this be adjust such that the two laser spot from the interferometer be directly on top of each other in order to find the null point the movable mirror on top of the stage have to be translate to the point where the separation from beam-splitter to both mirror be equal the movable mirror could be move through a position range of -12.5mm to 12.5mm and be initially maintain at the end of the stage 's range i.e -12.5mm the stage be then move in the positive translation direction 1mm at a time at a fast speed with the haidinger fringe observe manually on a screen place in front of the detector the fringe be observe to get big when it be close to the null point and small when far away the fix mirror be finely adjust after every 1mm increment to have the interference pattern center on the detector a best a could be do when the null point be pas the fringe change direction i.e they start appear out of the centre when they have be disappear into it this meant that the approximate location of the null point be identify such that the movable mirror could be scan through a small range of around 2mm rather than the full 25mm the photodetector be able to operate at 50hz use the detector and scan through the reduce range slowly at a speed of 0.002mms −1 the null point be able to be identify easily a a peak when a white lead source be use in place of the green laser subsequent data take use different source be center about this null point a blue lead and white tungsten source be use in addition to the white lead source an interferogram of the white lead source in the range of 0.02mm about the null point be take and a fast fourier transform fft of it be produce this be show in figure 2 and represent the range of wavelength of electromagnetic radiation present in the source there be two characteristic peak present in the spectrum one in the blue regime at approximately 455nm and the other in the yellow regime at 600nm this be due to the internal structure of the white lead -it be form of an individual blue lead with a phosphur coat that produce the yellow light through fluorescence it be expect that the amplitude of the first peak would be more than double the second from the datasheet of the lead however this be not observe here this be most likely due to the sensitivity to different wavelength of the detector use in the experiment -the spectral sensitivity of the detector be great at wavelength around the second yellow peak the white lead emits light encompass the whole range of the visible spectrum for comparison the interferogram of a blue lead source be also take and a fast fourier transform implement the spectrum obtain be show in figure 3. the peak wavelength be at around 470nm about 15mm large than the blue peak observe on the white lead spectrum this provide a rough insight into the uncertainty of the wavelength quote due to any misalignment and the set-up of the equipment the spectral width of the blue lead source could be calculate either from the fourier-transformed spectrum or directly from the interferogram after the interferogram have undergone a fourier-transform it be difficult to estimate how the uncertainty propagate so a gaussian be fit directly to the interferogram despite this the uncertainty on both the sensitivity of the detector and the actual position of the stage be difficult to ascertain so error on the whole be hard to obtain from the gaussian fit to the interferogram the standard deviation and associate uncertainty be able to be obtain and use a an estimate for the coherence length of the source the coherence length be then use to determine the spectral width of the source the spectral width of the blue lead source be calculate to be 30 ± 2 nm which be consistent with the spectrum in figure 3. the tungsten source could be consider a an approximate blackbody emit photon at a temperature give by wien 's law the fft be show in figure 4 and be a continuous spectrum the peak wavelength be take from the fourier transform and determine to be 830 ± 30 nm thus lead to a calculation of the temperature of the source 3490 ± 130 k. although figure 4 spectrum of a white tungsten source a a result of apply a fast fourier transform to the measure interferogram this be approximately a blackbody emission spectrum this blackbody approximation be make the interferogram be also fit with a gaussian curve to estimate the spectral width of the source from the fitting this be calculate to be 210±10nm a substantial fraction of the source be make up of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared region despite appear similar to the white lead source by eye the tungsten source be fundamentally different -consisting of a continuous spectrum of wavelength from the low end of the visible spectrum to infrared whilst the lead spectrum have two peak in the blue and green regime and do not emit radiation that be not visible to the human eye the difference can be explain by the efficiency of the source -there be more heat waste in the tungsten source in the infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum the white lead source be a more efficient source of light in the visible spectrum a a large fraction of the tungsten spectrum can not be see by the human eye from the datasheet of the tungsten source it be expect that the peak wavelength would be at 1200nm although this be not observe this be most likely due to the detector and it low sensitivity to wavelength of infrared light the specification manual for the detector indicates that sensitivity drop off rapidly for wavelength exceed 900nm 5 a yellow filter be place on the tungsten source a a mean of isolate frequency of visible yellow radiation the interferogram obtain be show in figure 5. the filter act a a sinc filter cut off frequency component above a certain cut-off frequency such a filter would have lead to a top-hat function after a fft a it be a rectangular low-pass filter in frequency space however this be not observe but could have arisen due to unfiltered light be reflect off the side of the container into the detector or from uncertainty in position of the stage have be move a michelson interferometer be adapt to be use a a fourier transform spectrometer capable of analyse different light source the interference pattern of a blue lead source white lead source and white tungsten source be record and use fast fourier transforms the original waveform be recover the spectrum give an insight to the wavelength component of the source and allow for the white lead and tungsten source to be contrast the lead source be compose of constituent wavelength throughout the visible range whilst the tungsten source involve the near-infrared spectrum in the white lead spectrum characteristic blue and yellow peak be observe at 455 ± 10 nm and 600 ± 10 nm respectively the peak wavelength of the tungsten source be determine to be 830 ± 30 the relative amplitude of the peak in the white lead spectrum and peak wavelength of the white tungsten source could not be reliably measure due to the spectral sensitivity of the detector use which be not constant however it could be conclude that the white lead be more efficient in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum a less energy be lose a infrared radiation if these uncertainty could be eliminate more accurate data could have be determine for the light source 6 bibliography,superficial,none,60,0.436560243,0.563439727

be show from the geometry of the figure that where λ be the wavelength of light m be the order of the maximum and θ be the angle at which the mth order maximum be observe the interferometer that we assemble consists of a mirror sit on top of a moveable stage the null point be define a the position of the stage at which the central maximum of interference be observe the light emit by a source be compose of several wavelength in a give spectral width of a gaussian this cause the interference produce to be a sum of the interference between all the wavelength present a white light source can be imagine a have a spectral width over the whole visible range the interferogram signal record due to interference be a fourier transform of the spectrum a wide spectrum be need to produce a narrow interferogram therefore a white lead be use to locate the exact position of the central maximum of interference -the null point we expect to see an interferogram similar to the one see in fig 2. the fourier transform f k of a function f x be give by the function f x can be retrieve through an inverse fourier transform of f k by the fourier transform of an interferogram signal record give the constituent frequency and thus wavelength that make up the signal these transforms be implement through the fft python scipy package to extract the signal spectrum the coherence length l of a source be define a the distance over which the phase of a wave measure at different point remains constant to a specify degree and be give by where c be the speed of light and ∆ν be the spectral widththe emit by a source l be determine by fitting a gaussian to the envelope of the interferogram and measure it standard deviation the width in wavelength can be found by where λ be the mean wavelength of the source which be found by fitting a gaussian on the fourier transform of the interferogram and calculate it mean the tungsten source behaves like a black body and hence it temperature can be determine use wien 's displacement law which state that where b be wien 's displacement constant an estimate for the band gap e gap between the conduction and valence band of the p-n junction can be determine from λ a this be only an estimate a the lead emits photon over a range of wavelength thus information regard the internal structure of light source can be infer the quality of measurement be highly dependent on the alignment of the interferometer the interferometer that be built be similar to the layout of the michelson interferometer see in fig 3 the distance of an arm of the interferometer be variable a the mirror be fix onto a moveable stage when the length of the arm d be equal the central maximum be observe on the detector and the position of the stage be at the null point the length of the arm be approximately set to be equal use a ruler between the mirror and the beam splitter 12 ± 0.5 cm in our setup all the component be fix onto an optical breadboard to minimise the effect of induced vibration and mechanical impact which could lead to noise in the signal record by the detector the source be fix onto the beam splitter column either through a attachable beam collimator or be fix onto a clamp and direct at the beam splitter the breadboard ensure that the laser and the splitter be parallel to the table surface to ensure normally incident light for the alignment process a green laser be use the fine adjustment screw on the fix mirror be adjust so that the two split beam be incident normally on the beam splitter and therefore a single combine spot from the two beam can be see on the detector with the interferometer setup the null point need to be found upon set the arm to be approximately equal in length the fine adjustment screw be use to adjust the tilt such that fringe due to interference could be observe on the detector for well visibility the laser light be pas through a lens to be incident on a dark screen this magnify the straight line fizeau fringe and the circular haidinger fringe a a preliminary the central maximum of the haidinger fringe be center in the spot and the stage be move in small increment such that the fringe move far apart the null point have be pas over when the fringe start get closer instead after a certain point consequently the laser be replace by a white lead and a small range across this point be scan to obtain an interferogram over the null point with the location of the null point note the interferograms of a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten source be take by move the stage in a small range across the null point with a stage speed of 2 µms −1 and a sample frequency of 50 hz these parameter ensure that enough detail of the signal be record in agreement with the nyquist theorem the data from each interferogram be then fourier transform to obtain the frequency and thus the wavelength present in the signal a gaussian be fit onto these transforms to calculate the mean wavelength emit by each source another gaussian be fit onto the actual signal center at the null poi to determine l from the standard deviation from which ∆v be calculate use equation 4 the transforms and gaussians be normalise a different detector gain be use depend on the source ∆λ be also calculate use the mean wavelength from the fourier transform and the spectral width use equation 5 finally the temperature of the tungsten optical fibre and the mean band gap of the lead be calculate use equation 6 and 7 respectively a. white lead a can be see the wavelength extend over the visible range from around 470 nm to 660 nm λ be found to be 510 ± 10 nm from the gaussian fit ∆ν be calculate to be 16.0 ± 0.6 thz and ∆λ be determine to be 13.8 ± 0.7 nm this value be very close to the error on λ and we expect them to approximately agree e gap be calculate to be 2.43 ± 0.05 ev from the interferogram the presence of a substantial amount of noise and secondary peak can be note this may have widen l and decrease the value of ∆λ a we expect a great value a can be see from the width of the fourier transform the fit on the fourier transform perhaps do not represent the high wavelength amplitude peak in the error on λ and indicates that a fit of the sum of two or three gaussians might be well this might imply that the lead be make from a combination of two or three semiconductor p-n junction r-g-b however the spectrum of the white lead be concentrate in the blue range this be confirm by our observation of characteristic concentric blue and white spot when the lead be shone onto a black surface this be because the lead be actually a blue lead with a yellow phosphor coat which lead to a shift in some of the blue wavelength into yellow wavelength photon 1 a yellow and blue be anti-colours they combine to produce white light therefore our result confirm the physical observation and our knowledge about the function of the lead -implying the fit must be a sum of two gaussians the value of ∆λ be very close to the error on λ and we expect them to approximately agree the major peak around the blue range lead to the gaussian not accounting for the amplitude observe between 550 nm to 650 nm decrease the value of λ and explains the low than expect value of the error on λ. however the secondary peak could also be atrributed to noise perhaps manually alter the gaussian parameter and decrease noise would lead to great value for the wavelength width and the error on λ and might lead to agreement between them with small amplitude around 390 nm to 460 nm the major peak extends from 460 nm to 510 nm we also observe a secondary peak at 470 nm -perhaps suggest the fit must have be a sum of two gaussians instead of just one this maybe because the lead emits in two separate distinct blue wavelength range λ be found to be 485 ± 8 nm and ∆ν a 12.1 ± 0.1 thz therefore a ∆λ of 9.51 ± 0.23 nm be determine similar to the white lead a slight disagreement between the error on the width ∆λ and the error on λ be see the fourier transform gaussian need to be manually alter sum of two gaussians to include the small wavelength amplitude which would have increase ∆λ a we expect it to be slightly high between 20 nm to 30 nm a indicate by the width of fourier transform e gap be found to be 2.56 ± 0.04 ev for both lead the secondary peak appear due to the misalignment of the interferometer and be not high order maximum a the interferogram be not symmetric the lead do not have a uniform intensity profile due to it curve geometry to prevent the intensity from be measure diagonally across it profile a ground diffuser be use to create a uniform beam incident on the beam splitter to reduce the variable noisy intensity record many attempt be make to correct the alignment with this be the best data that we acquire eliminate noise would have lead to narrower interferograms small value for l and thus high value for ∆λ c. tungsten optical fibre λ be found to be 839 ± 127 nm and ∆ν be calculate a 51.3 ± 1.6 thz ∆λ be determine to be 121 ± 26 nm the error on λ be include within the error on ∆λ a we expect a the tungsten optical fibre show black-body behavior it temperature t be found to be 3450±520 k. the temperature of a typical tungsten filament be about 3300 k 2 the error on t include this value the difference in the value can be explain by the detector 's construction the silicon detector use cut off frequency high than 1100 nm while the source emits over 1100 nm 3 hence if these wavelength be include the value of λ would increase and thus t would decrease closer to the typical value the amplitude see over 1200 nm in the fourier transform could be noise due to the detector 's inability to detect them thus the tungsten source and interferometry also allow u to confirm a specification of the detector although the difference in value could also be attribute to random error and noise within the record signal a the quote value be include within the error in this investigation we construct a michelson interferometer to be use a a spectrometer to investigate the characteristic of light source the spectrum of white and blue lead and a tungsten optical fibre be obtain by record interferograms for each source around the null point the spectral width a frequency and wavelength be calculate ∆λ for the white lead be obtain to be 13.8 ± 0.7 nm and differ by 32 from the error on λ with an e gap 2.43±0.05 ev ∆λ for the blue lead be obtain to be 9.51 ± 0.23 nm and differ by 17 from the error on λ with an e gap 2.56±0.04 ev the spectrum of the white light allow u to confirm it internal structure and function -a blue lead with a yellow phosphur coat a a consequence the band gap of the white lead may be the same a that of a blue lead this will need to be explore in great detail in a future experiment the tungsten source be found to have a ∆λ of 121 ± 26 nm differ by 5 from the error on it λ and include it within it error the temperature of the source be determine to be 3450 ± 520 k. the difference of 4 from the quote value and the range of the fourier transform allow u to confirm the maximum of the spectral sensitivity of the detector be between 1100-1200 nm the difference in spectral width should be explore in great detail in a future experiment by fitting the sum of two gaussians to obtain more accurate width the sample frequency of the detector be set to 50 hz this be enough to include enough detail about the signal but could perhaps be increase to minimise the noise that be evident in the interferograms even far,deep,exp,70,0.452222705,0.547777295
50,2ndINT_FHJ539_Redacted,"an optical fourier transform spectrometer base on the michelson interferometer be use to determine the interference pattern and spectral property of different light source in this paper the average wavelength coherence length and spectral width for a white light emit diode lead blue lead and white tungsten source be accurately obtain a within the uncertainty the experimental value match the accepted value five atomic spectral line of mercury be measure with wavelength match the accepted value to 3 significant figure the yellow mercury doublet be also observe to display a beating pattern the michelson interferometer ushered a new era of modern physic by debunk the theory that light propagate through an aether thereby validate einstein 's theory of special relativity it have many u in modern day physic include the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ligo and hyper-spectral image for earth observation 1 which make use of the interferometer 's ability to make precise displacement measurement 2 with sensitivity well than 10 −19 mhz −1 2 in this paper the michelson interferometer be use in a fourier transform spectrometer this paper u the michelson interferometer to measure the wavelength coherence length and spectral width of different light source use precise measurement of distance 3 it be also use to observe the atomic spectrum of mercury and the separation of wavelength of a non-monochromatic source the yellowdoublet in mercury which give rise to a beating effect the michelson interferometer consists of two right-angled mirror and a beamsplitter which be a partially-silvered mirror that split the incoming light source into two beam of equal amplitude e 0 4 the dielectric plate on the beamsplitter cause a phase shift in one of the beam the beam be reflect at the two different mirror and be recombine at the beamsplitter 4 a schematic layout of the set-up be show in figure 1. the beam be assume to travel only in air give the dielectric constant a unity if the distance between the mirror hence the distance traverse by the different beam d be similar an interference pattern be produce assume the light source be monochromatic constructive interference occurs when where t be the difference in the arm length of the interferometer a show in figure 1 λ be the wavelength of the light source θ be the angle to the normal and m be an integer 5 fig 1 schematic diagram of a michelson interferometer 4 where m1 the movable mirror be at right-angles to m2 the tiltable mirror the beam from the source be split into two beam by the beamsplitter and reflect at mirror m1 and m2 m2 be the virtual image of m2 a see through the beamsplitter they recombine at the beamsplitter and the interference pattern be measure by the detector in a fourier transform spectrometer mirror m1 be able to translate back and forth change d. the recombine beam be detect synchronously 6 the amplitude of the recombine beam e r be give by where ω be the frequency of the beam and δ the phase difference between the beam be give by where ∆ be the path difference 6 the intensity of e r can then be give by where k be the wavenumber 6 for a non-monochromatic light source with spectral distribution of i k and different wavenumbers k intensity i ∆ be give by which be the fourier transform of i k the intensity of the light source 6 a white light consists of wavelength range from 400nm to 750nm 5 an interference pattern only occurs when all the wavenumbers be interfere constructively this happens when equation 1 be wavelength independent give t 0. a t increase slowly the colour begin to separate until the fringe pattern be wash out completely by the interference of the many different wavelength therefore the coherence length of a white light source be very short and only a few µm long when the light source contains two similar wavelength a beating effect be observe a show in figure 2. this result in a combination of a fast oscillation in an envelope of a slow oscillation characteristic of where f 1 f 2 be the two different frequency present in the light source 7 fig 2 beating effect cause by the interference of two light source with wavelength 589.0nm and 589.6nm simulated use python this experiment u three different type of light source a light emit diode lead a tungsten filament lamp and a gas discharge lamp lead 's emit light when current flow through it in a process call electroluminescence 8 the tungsten light source work by conduct electricity along a thin and long tungsten filament which cause it to heat up the tungsten filament approximates a black-body and emits thermal radiation light from a gas discharge lamp be emit due to electron transition from high energy level 6 quantisation of the energy level give rise to discrete spectral line however the uncertainty in the excitation lifetime result in a spread of transition energy from the heisenberg uncertainty principle 3 this result in natural broadening therefore the emit light will contain a range of frequency and can no longer be model by dirac-delta function the relative motion of the atom to the observer result in a doppler shift of the frequency this increase the bandwidth which resembles a gaussian shape collision of the atom with each other will result in a lorentz broadening 3 the convolution of a gaussian and lorentz function be a voigt function due to the broadening mechanism present the light emit display certain characteristic such a a coherence length l be which be optical delay over which interference effect be observe and a spectral width ∆v which be the measure of the range of frequency emit by the source 3 l and ∆v be related by where c be the speed of light 4 the set-up of the michelson interferometer be show in figure 3. the movable mirror m1 be place on a linear stage control by a linear motor the different light source observe in this experiment be a colimated green laser a white light emit diode lead a blue lead a white light tungsten source and a penray mercury lamp the experimental apparatus be set-up carefully and the initial alignment be checked to ensure the mirror be parallel to the beamsplitter and perpendicular to each other the colimated laser beam be use to check and perfect the alignment by ensure the reflection of the laser beam on the various optical apparatus coincide with each other and the centre of the view screen the plano-convex lens be use to amplify the image during the alignment to ensure the interference pattern be appropriately centre this be do to reduce the uncertainty due to the misalignment of the apparatus and to ensure a clear interference pattern could be observe the distance between the mirror m1 and m2 and the detector d be make a similar and a small a possible to reduce the attenuation of the light source in air and increase the intensity detect this be also do to ensure the effect due to the misalignment be a small a possible the colimated green laser through a 25mm plano-convex lens be use to find the null point the position at which the optical path length difference t be zero this be do by observe the direction of the curvature of the interference fringe on a white screen set-up show in figure 3 a mirror m1 translates slowly the interval to a few mm in which the curvature revers direction contain the null point this interval be then scan quickly with the white lead to find the exact position of the null point the ground glass diffuser be place in front of the white lead to focus and enhance the uniformity of the white light source a green and yellow filter be place between source and the beamsplitter to isolate and observe different bandwidth of the white light and mercury spectrum when use the mercury source the 100 mm focal length planoconvex lens be place in front of the detector to focus the light from the mercury lamp and obtain a clearer interference pattern this be do because the mercury source be uncolimated result in a lot of scatter light and a low intensity detect the mercury lamp be also left on for more than 10 minute to allow it to sufficiently heat up the linear motor have a minimum incremental motion of 20nm 9 therefore the translational velocity of mirror m1 be take in the range of 0.2 − 4 µms −1 a a compromise between the amount of time need to obtain the result the number of data point need to get clear result and reduce the uncertainty due to the vibration and non-constant step in the linear motor the interference pattern obtain from the different light source be analyse by first apply a hilbert transform which allows the derivation of the analytic representation of the light source also call the analytic signal 10 the analytic signal be a complex value function where both imaginary and real part be function of space with no negative frequency component 10 the hilbert transform of the real part be the complex conjugate of the imaginary part of the function this allows the instantaneous amplitude 10 of the interference pattern to be obtain which be the envelope of the interference pattern although the interference pattern be best model by a voigt function due to the broadening mechanism present for mathematical simplicity a normal distribution or gaussian be use the l be give by the standard deviation σ of a gaussian which can be found by fitting a gaussian to the hilbert transform of the interference pattern the spectral width can be then calculate use equation 8. the fourier transform of the interference pattern be found use equation 5to obtain information about the emission of light from the light source since the fourier transform of a gaussian be also a gaussian the average wavelength and uncertainty can be found from the mean and standard deviation of the gaussian fit to the fourier transform of the interference pattern the experimental and theoretical value of the average wavelength coherence length and spectral width of the different light source be show in table i. table i the value of the experimental and theoretical value of the average wavelength coherence length and spectral width of the interference pattern of the light emit from different source along with their respective uncertainty the theoretical value be obtain from the manufacturing website of the different light source 9,11 the interferograms of the white and blue lead be show in figure 4 and 5 the coherence length of the blue lead be much longer compare to that of the white lead a show in table i. this be due to white light have a range of wavenumbers and therefore will only interfere when there be constructive interference between all the wavenumbers however the coherence length of the white lead be longer than that of the tungsten source a the white lead produce white light by change monochromatic blue light to white use a layeremitting phosphor on the lead 8 this also cause the average wavelength emit by the white lead to lie close to that emit by the blue lead the interference pattern of the white lead show asymmetry this be due to the non-uniformity of the source which shine with a high intensity on the right side use a ground glass increase the uniformity of the light source thereby decrease the asymmetry but do not completely fix it due to the asymmetry a skewed nonnal distribution be fit to the interference pattern to obtain an accurate value of the coherence length and spectral width the probability density function of a skewed nonnal distribution be give by j x 2ef x ax 9 where be a normal distribution function and be the cumulative distribution function give by where a be a parameter which defines the skewness of the distribution which be the measure of asymmetry of the distribution 12 the interference pattern have a value of 6.3 for a indicate it have a right skew the coherence length of the tungsten source be shorter compare to that of the white lead a show in figure 6. the fourier transfonn of the tungsten source show in figure 7 do not simulate a black-body spectrum instead it look similar to the fourier transfonn of the white lead with a high standard deviation this be due to the spectral sensitivity of the detector which be a silicon pin photodiode fig 6 the interference pattern of the white tungsten source fit with a hilbert transfonn and a skewed normal distribution function it have a short interference pattern a it emits a wide range of wavelength which only interfere constructively near the null point where t 0. that have an upper detection limit of 950nm and a low limit of 400nm 13 fig 7 the fourier transfonn of the white tungsten source fit with a nonnal distribution which be use to obtain the average wavelength emit by the source the spectrum do not resemble that of black-body radiation and instead look similar to that emit by the white lead the tungsten source be found to have an average wavelength in the infrared region a show by table i and figure 7. assume the tungsten filament act a a black-body and the peak wavelength amax be similar to the average wavelength the temperature can be estimate use wien 's displacement law give by 4 le-5 t λ max 2.898 × 10 −3 11 to give t to 3500 ± 500 k. the specification of the tungsten light source use give λ max a 1000nm and t a 2796 pm15 k 11 which be outside the range of detection of the photo-diode lead to the theoretical value not match the experimental one the average wavelength and relative intensity of mercury 's spectral line be show in table ii table ii the value of the experimental and theoretical average wavelength 14 and relative intensity for the different spectral line of mercury along with their respective uncertainty the fourier transform of the interference pattern of light emit by the mercury lamp when no filter be use be show in figure 8. three spectral line with different wavelength correspond to the blue green and the infrared region of electromagnetic radiation be observe from the fourier transform of the interference pattern fig 8 the fourier transform of the light emit by the mercury lamp fit with a superposition of three normal distribution which be use to obtain the average wavelength emit by the source three spectral line be see which correspond a blue green and infrared spectral line apply the yellow filter allows the yellow mercury doublet to be observe a show by the fourier transform of the interference pattern in figure 9. ii the peak on the right in figure 9 corresponds to 600±26 nm mercury have two spectral line that lie within the uncertainty of the wavelength obtain for peak 2 579nm and 580nm with relative intensity 900 and 400 respectively 14 compare the relative intensity of two peak with the theoretical value of the relative intensity peak 2 more closely corresponds to the spectral line with wavelength 579nm the relative intensity of the experimental value do not closely correspond to that of the theoretical value this could be due to the relative spectral sensitivity of the photodiode which varies accord to wavelength 13 or the fourier transforms inability to measure relative intensity accurately the interference of the two yellow spectral line which have similar wavelength result in a beating pattern a show in figure 10 which be very similar to the beating pattern show in figure 2. the envelope of the interference pattern can be fit use cosine function which be expect from a beating phenomenon equation 7 be use to obtain the beat frequency of the yellow-doublet which be found to be 25 ± 4 t hz the interference obtain do not have any destructive interference due to the different intensity of the spectral line show in figure 9. observe the interference pattern of the yellow-doublet over a longer range show that the beating pattern do not continue this show that although the two wavelength have very similar wavelength they be not exactly coherent with each other the big error present in the experiment be due to the limited range of wavelength which could be detect by the photodiode which might have lead to overestimate of coherence length and spectral width this be because include more wavelength of electromagnetic radiation result in the interference lose coherence faster this be especially true for the measurement of white light use the lead and tungsten wire a the relative sensitivity at 400nm and high than 930nm be very low which might have result in the intensity of the light around those wavelength be too low to be differentiate from the background noise therefore a photodiode capable of detect a wider range of wavelength with a relatively constant spectral sensitivity should be use to obtain more accurate result another cause of error in the experiment be the assumption that the beam of light only travel in air throughout the experiment however the electromagnetic wave travel through the beamsplitter which be make of glass which result in a decrease value of c use in equation 8. therefore take into account correction for the value of c will result in more accurate calculation of the spectral width the aim of this experiment be to investigate the interference pattern emit by different light source use a fourier transform spectrometer base on a michelson interferometer the light source investigate be a light emit diode lead a tungsten filament lamp and a gas-discharge lamp this be do by determine the average wavelength coherence length spectral width and atomic spectrum of the different light source the experimental value of the wavelength obtain for the blue lead white lead and white tungsten source be 485 ± 13 nm 560 ± 76 nm and 810 ± 120 nm respectively accurate to 3 significant figure five spectral line of mercury be observe and correspond to the wavelength 435 ± 23 nm 549 ± 31 nm 1010 ± 50 nm 571 ± 25 nm and 600 ± 26 the experiment be accurate in determine the different wavelength present in the light source a the value obtain in the experiment lie within one standard deviation of the theoretical value however the value obtain be not very precise with uncertainty a high a 14.8 this could have be due to the high background noise due to external vibration and light more precise method should be use to obtain well result by incorporate interferometer lock 2 and use a more precise detector such a a charge-coupled device or a fieldprogrammable gate array 15",prediction,bal,65,0.453590125,0.546409905
5,2ndINT_YZI659_Redacted,this report be an investigation into categorise different light source use interferometry and fourier transforms a a spectrometer five different light source be test a blue lead which yield a wavelength of 470.1 ± 8.6 nm a white lead comprise of two wavelength of 445.3 ± 10.4 nm and 562.8 ± 55.5 nm respectively these be in the red and blue part of the visible spectrum and combine to give white light a tungsten source be also test with a green and a yellow filter to give 539.9 ± 23.1 nm and 572.4 ± 30.6 nm the final source that be test be a mercury discharge lamp which have peak of 433.8 ± 20.6 nm and 547.9 ± 31.8 nm with a doublet value of 568.5 ± 1.1 nm these wavelength be that of the emission spectrum of mercury and all lie within 1.5 of the accepted value t his experiment aim to categorise light source and their spectrum by use an interferometer a a spectrometer use the technique of fourier transforms this be a very powerful technique in many different aspect of physic so it be important to ensure that knowledge of how it work be know the instrument be also very sensitive so it be easy to misalign the apparatus and get false data so great care have to be take to align it properly once this be do any source can be test and it spectrum extract ii theory this project u the technique of interferometry and fourier transforms to investigate different light source interferometry be a technique in which wave in this case the wave be electromagnetic be superimpose to cause interference information about the wave can then be extract from this pattern of interference the interferometer use in this experiment be know a a michelson interferometer it consists of a light-source that be pas into a beam-splitter which cause part of the light to pa out at a right angle form the incident ray both of these beam be then reflect off mirror before be recombine in the beam-splitter and be measure at a detector what be measure be the interference of the recombine beam at the detector these interfere due to a path difference on the two arm of the interferometer if monochromatic plane wave of wavelength λ be pas through the interferometer they will interfere constructively to cause a bright fringe when the path difference be an integer multiple of λ and destructivly to cause a dark patch when it be λ 2 this interference cause a pattern of fringe there be two type of fringe that can be see in this experiment haidinger and fizeau these occur from different orientation of the mirror a convenient way to picture this be with two mirror separate by a distance t which represent the path difference of the arm in the interferometer this be show in figure 2. since this be an extend source the angle θ will vary for all the incoming ray there will only be constructive interference to cause bright fringe when the path difference of the two ray be equal to an an integer number of wavelength so since θ varies between the ray there will only be constructive interference at specific value of θ. this cylindrical symmetry of this set up cause the haidinger fringe which be circular in shape by tilt one of the mirror this cylindrical symmetry be broken thus cause straight line fizaeu fringe this be demonstrate in the figure 3 it be the haidinger fringe that be use in this experiment a this be when the set up be correctly align the equation that governs these fringe be give by in this investigation the interferometer be be use a a spectrometer to determine wavelength of different light source this can be do by use the mathematical method of fourier transforms a fourier transform be a method that take a signal that be a function of time and decomposes it into the frequency that make it up in this way a signal can be measure on an interferogram and when a fourier transform be act on it a function of wavelength or frequency can be extract this be do by scan a sample around where t=0 which be know a the null point a corollary of fourier transforms be that a gaussian will give rise to another gaussian under a fourier transform since the light source use approximate gaussians then the transform in frequency space will also be a gaussian with an associate spread this spread in frequency space be inversely proportional to the spread in the measure signal a narrow gaussian spectral line be cause by a wide interferogram and the oposite be true for a wide spectral line this be demonstrate in the figure below it be this technique that be use to extract the information about wavelength and frequency that make up the light source this investigation look to characterise five different source of light a blue and white lead a tungsten light with green and yellow filter and a mercury discharge lamp first before any of these source be test it be require that the interferometer be set up and align correctly so that the position of the null point could be locate correctly to do this the set up show in figure 1 be construct on an optical bench care have to be take to ensure that the two mirror be equidistant from the beam-splitter so the path length would not exceed that of the coherence length this would cause no interference to occur next the set up be align use a green laser the laser be pas through the beamsplitter with a convex lens place between the two this cause the beam to spread out and aid in get the alignment correct the detector be remove and the pattern create by the two beam be observe the fix mirror have knob on it that allow for an adjustment of it tilt and these be adjust until the two beam from both mirror overlap and interference fringe could be see it be possible to see both haidinger circular and fizeau flat fringe the haidinger fringe expect can be see below once this be see the set up be align the next step be to locate the null point and this be most easily do with the same green laser one of the mirror be move via a computer at a control speed to create in interferogram this be do over a large range so that the high peak could be see and this be the null point to find this quickly though it be see that a the mirror approach the null point the circular fringe get large and also move concentrically towards the center and the opposite be true for move away this be use to gain a rough estimate of the range of value that contain the null point by observe the movement of the fringe at different value this range be then scan at a slow speed to find the exact value of the null point once the null point be locate data be able to be collect each light source be in turn place in front of the beam-splitter and a slow scan over the null point be conduct this data be then use to create an interferogram which could then be fourier transform to give graph of the intensity of light that be emit at different wavelength in this section the graph and fit of each different light source will be show displayed first be be the graph for the blue lead figure 7 show that a white lead be comprise of two distinct wavelength of λ 1 445.3nm and λ 2 562.8nm with spread of 10.4nm and 55.5nm respectively the graph see at the end of the next page be those of the tungsten lamp first with a yellow filter and second with a green filter the different peak wavelength highlight in the mercury plot can be see displayed in the table below v. discussion the first source that be test be the blue lead a can be see in the section before it have a peak wavelength of 470.1±8.6 nm a true blue phosphor lead have a wavelength of 470nm so the measure value be accurate with the expect value and also precise with an error of 1.8 it can be see in figure 6 that there be only one sharp spike in the wavelength spectrum indicate that this be the only wavelength present in the source this be what would be expect from a blue lead the next source test be the white lead in figure 7. it can be see here that there be two gaussian peak of 445.3 ± 10.4 nm and 562.8 ± 55.5 nm these peak correspond to a peak in the blue and a peak in the red part of the visible spectrum this be due to the white lead be form by a blue short wavelength lead that cause the first spike with a yellow phosphor coat this coat release red light when it interacts with the photon be release from the lead and this be what cause the second peak the combination of these two source of light be what cause the lead to be white adjust the amount of coat can adjust how red the lead be cause white lead to be either cool more blue light or warm more red light these value have a percentage error of 2.3 and 9.8 respectively but this be due to the spread of the gaussian of the wavelength a discus before a sharp spike in an interferogram cause a large spread in the wavelength so this show that the region of interference for the red light be very small when compare to white lead spectrum the measure data match the next source use be a tungsten source that have a yellow and a green filter place in front of it the spectrum for these can be see in figure 8 and 9 respectively the first be the yellow filter and this have a peak wavelength of 572.4±30.6 nm which have a percentage spread of 5.4 this wavelength be what would be expect from a yellow filter source figure 9 show the spectrum for the green filter tungsten source this have a peak wavelength of 539.9 ± 23.1 nm which have a percentage spread of 4.3 this be consistent with the expect wavelength of green light it also have a small spread than the yellow filter show that the interference range be great it can be see in both figure that there be a dip in the middle of the spectrum which look like an apparent doublet this be an anomaly that arises from misalignment of the interferometer a it pas over the null point this could be fix by more accurately align the set up and make sure that it do n't move when a new source be connect the final source test be a mercury discharge lamp see in figure 10 and 11. these two plot contain the same data but with different gaussian curve plot over them to signify two possible position of the mercury doublet the two main peak of both figure be locate at 433.8 ± 20.6 nm and 547.9 ± 31.8 nm give percentage spread of 4.7 and 5.8 these value correspond to the atomic emission spectrum of mercury which have emission line at 435.8nm and 546.1nm for violet and green spectral line these lie close to the measure value show that these value be accurate be only 0.5 and 0.3 off the accepted value it can be see also that the second peak contains two peak indicate that there be a doublet present here where the accepted value of this be 577.0nm this indicates that it be the fit show in figure 10 that be the correct fit with wavelength of 568.5 ± 1.1 nm which have percentage spread of 0.2 and lie 1.5 off the accepted value this show that this be accurate with accepted data and be also a precise measurement the aim of this report be to use the technique of interferometry and fourier transforms to measure and categorise light source use the interferometer a a spectrometer the light source that be test be a blue and a white lead a tungsten source with green and yellow filter and a mercury discharge lamp it be measure that the blue light have a wavelength of 470.1 ± 8.6 nm which be accurate with the value of the wavelength of a blue lead which be 470nm the next source test be white lead which have two peak of 445.3 ± 10.4 nm and 562.8 ± 55.5 nm respectively this translates to a peak in the blue and red part of the visible spectrum which be consistent with how white lead be form the tungsten source have peak wavelength of 572.4 ± 30.6 nm for the yellow filter and 539.9 ± 23.1 nm for the green filter light these peak be less define a the set up be not properly align which lead to there be a dip in the middle of the spectrum cause it to look like two separate peak the final source test be a mercury discharge lamp this have peak at 433.8 ± 20.6 nm and 547.9 ± 31.8 nm with a doublet value of 568.5 ± 1.1 nm these correspond to the atomic emission specrum of mercury and be 0.5 0.3 and 1.2 off the accepted value for this emission

33,2ndINT_SUY577_Redacted,this meant that the tungsten source emit the large range of frequency follow by the white lead the blue lead and lastly the tungsten source with a green filter which emit a very narrow range of frequency a michelson interferometer be a device which split an incident light source into two equal amplitude beam the interferometer be align such that the two beam recombine and interfere result in an interference pattern the instrument be invent by a. michelson in 1887 1 the operation of a michelson interferometer and it use a a spectrometer be explain in detail in section ii michelson interferometer have a wide range of application include stellar measurement detection of gravitational wave and in optical fibre for the purpose of this experiment a michelson interferometer be use a a spectrometer the main aim of this experiment be to quantitatively analyse the spectrum from a variety of different light source this meant determine value for certain property of the source such a their mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width these be define in section ii a green laser be use to align the interferometer until clear visible fringe could be see at the photodiode detector this be necessary a without the presence of an interference pattern useful interferograms could not be record this experiment also aim to give an understand of the construction of a michelson interferometer and obtain interferograms for a variety of different light source include a white lead a blue lead and a white light tungsten source 2 the mirror m2 be fix the mirror m1 be movable so that the optical path difference between the two beam can be varied the variable t describes the difference in distance between the two arm of the interferometer m2 simply refers to the apparent position of mirror 2 when view by an observer in a michelson interferometer the incident light beam travel towards the beamsplitter where approximately half of it be reflect the other half be transmit the two beam take different path which be orthogonal to each other both beam be reflect and travel back towards the beamsplitter where they recombine and produce an interference pattern at the detector this interference pattern be dependent upon the difference in distance travel by the two beam if the distance travel by the two beam be exactly equal then they should be in phase and a such should intefere constructively result in a bright fringe on the interference pattern however this be not the case because of the presence of a dielectric plate a see in figure 2.1. the dielectric plate introduces a phase shift to one of the beam meaning that they instead interfere destructively when the path difference be zero result in a dark fringe on the interference pattern the michelson interferometer can be apply a a spectrometer when the difference in length of it arm be close to zero this position where the variable t 0 be know a the null point when use the michelson interferometer a a spectrometer it be often refer to a a fourier transform spectrometer 3 4 the michelson interferometer can be use to take interferograms of various source by simply move one of the mirror very slowly around the null point from these interferograms it be possible to determine certain characteristic about the incident source namely the mean wavelength of the source it coherence length and spectral width the mean wavelength for a source be define a simply an average of all the wavelength emit by the source the coherence length in term of the michelson interferometer be the distance over which one mirror of the interferometer can be move before the contrast on the interferogram becomes poor or the point at which the signal stop be sinusoidal on the interferogram the spectral width of a source show the spread of frequency it emits the spectral width of a source be related to it coherence length by the equation 2 δ𝜈 × 𝐿 𝑐 2𝜋 1 where δν be the spectral width in hz l be the coherence length in m and c be the speed of light it be the clear from 1 that the coherence length and spectral width be inversely proportional the large the coherence length of a source the small it spectral width these characteristic property will vary for different light source a they have slightly different way of emit light for example an lead do not emit light in the same way a a tungsten source however the exact detail of how these source emit light will not be discus in any detail in this report iii method the setup of the michelson interferometer in this experiment be very similar to that show in figure 2.1. however mirror 1 be mount onto a motorise stage which could move at a very slow speed the motorise stage be quote to be accurate to the micron the michelson interferometer be initially align use a green laser this be because the light from the laser be very close to be monochromatic make it easy to see interference fringe at the detector a lens with a focal length of 25.4mm be use to make the laser into an extend source the tilt of mirror 2 be adjust to align the spectrometer both straight line fizeau fringe and circular haidinger fringe be observe during the alignment to record the interferograms a photodiode detector connect via usb to a computer be instal on the right side of figure 3.1. at first large random spike be observe in the interferogram but this issue be resolve by switch the usb port to low latency mode to use the michelson interferometer a a spectrometer interferograms need to be record around the null point the null point be locate by take advantage of a property of the circular fringe involve their switch between sinking and source either side of it the null point be found to be at -0.9494 ± 0.0005 mm interferograms be then take for each source use the mirror mount on the movable stage for the white lead an interferogram be take over a range from -0.955 mm to -0.942 mm at a speed of 0.001 mm/s the motorise stage be quote to take 50 data point per second the uncertainty in the motorise stage be discus in section iv range and speed for other source can be see in figure 3 histogram of the spread of wavelength present in the source be generate from the interferograms use a computer algorithm use these alongside the interferograms it be possible to determine value for the mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width for each of the source the interferogram for the white lead be show in at first glance it can immediately be see that the coherence length for the white lead will be small judging from the narrow gaussian shape of figure 4.1 a the shape of the interferogram be expect to be small because there be many wavelength present in the incident source result in more destructive interference narrow the peak significantly due to the inverse relationship see earlier in 1 it be expect that the spectral width will be large and this be confirm by the sheer number of peak see in look at figure 4.2 a it clearly have a much wider gaussian distribution shape than that of figure 4.1 a this be an expect result a the blue lead emits a much small range of frequency compare with that of the white lead the small range of frequency mean that the spectral width for the blue lead be much small than that of the white lead refer to 1 again a small spectral width result in a large coherence length explain the shape of the green filter add a filter to the tungsten source broadens the shape of the gaussian envelope hugely there be now less frequency present in the light source at the detector so there be much less interference because the beam be much closer in wavelength the mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width be displayed in figure 4.5. ultimately the data in figure 4.5 suggests that the tungsten source emits the large range of frequency a it have the large spectral width and inversely the small coherence length the mean wavelength for the blue lead and the tungsten source with green filter do in general agree with accepted value of wavelength for light of that colour this suggests that the data be accurate to an extent the value do tend to agree with our expectation a for example we would expect to see a small spectral width for the blue lead a it be only emit blue light which have a wavelength range of approximately 450nm -490nm upon far investigation of the accuracy of the motorise stage it be found that after take 20 random consecutive sample and calculate the distance between them it be indeed accurate to the micron allow u to use this a our systematic error when find the coherence length the main purpose of this experiment be to investigate the characteristic of certain light source and to quantitatively analyse their spectrum use their interferograms this experiment use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer this involve use the movable mirror close to the null point of the interferometer to obtain suitable interferograms for the different source their mean wavelength coherence length and spectral width could then be determine the tungsten source with no filter prove to emit a very large range of frequency it have the large spectral width 40 ± 30 thz and the small coherence length 1.2 ± 1 μm conversely the tungsten source with a green filter result in a very narrow range of frequency the tungsten source with a green filter have a coherence length of 40 ± 1 μm and spectral width of 1.2 ± 0.03 thz the application of the filter to the tungsten result in a significant change in the coherence length and spectral width of the source the change be so dramatic perhaps because there be a single narrow green line in the spectrum of tungsten this experiment could perhaps be extend to other source of light such a a sodium lamp which be commonly use in street light investigation of the zeeman effect could also be a source of extension to the experiment,superficial,none,70,0.571027458,0.428972542
57,2ndINT_BMS328_Redacted,this investigation sought to observe some of the property of various light source with the use of a michelson interferometer this interferometer consist of a stepper motor which would change the type of haidinger fringe observe it be essential that the null point be found a this would be the point where reading would be measure from four different light source be use include a white lead a blue lead a tungsten halogen light source and a mercury discharge lamp the white lead produce two clear peak a expect with wavelength of 441nm ± 51.0nm and 563nm ± 123nm the former of these wavelength prove to match the calculate mean wavelength of the blue lead also analyse with a wavelength of 454nm ± 4.00 × 10 −8 m. the tungsten halogen light source be measure both with band pa filter and without the former of these provide lorentzian peak with the yellow filter lie within the range of the mean wavelength measure however the wavelength measure for the green filter do not lie within the bandwidth of the green filter use the measurement take without filter provide a curve that approximately follow that of a black body curve until the infared spectrum where these two line 'diverged due to the limitation of the detector the mercury fft provide two distinct peak with some splitting however the value obtain lay outside of the expect value for the green spectral line and yellow doublet t he first use of the michelson interferometer come in 1887 with the michelson-morley experiment which aim to detect the earth movement through the 'luminiferous ether 1 this configuration of interferometer have go on to be very useful in multiple area of study include the detection of ligo 's detection of gravitational wave in 2015 2 this investigation seek to investigate the composition and property of several light source which include white light from a tungsten and lead source a blue lead and a mercury discharge lamp this can be do by take interferograms of the various light source and use this to generate a fourier transform to determine property of the light source such a spectral width coherence length and peak wavelength this spectral analysis can be accomplish use the michelson interferometer which be another application of interferometry in it most fundamental form the michelson interferometer consists of two arm connect by a beam splitter which split and then recombine the light source which can be either monochromatic or chromatic from the two path to generate a superimpose signal compose of light and dark fringe which can be detect and analyse 3 there be two main type of interference pattern that be commonly produce by this kind of interferometer the first and most important for this investigation be the haidinger fringe which produce line of equal inclination and the frizeau fringe which generate line of equal separation haidinger fringe be more useful a in theory they should produce a more sinusoidal signal for intensity against distance move by one of the mirror on the interferometer in addition the haidinger fringe make it easy to find the null point of the interferometer which be where the path difference between the two path length t be zero there be two factor that affect the production of interference on a michelson interferometer with those be the linear distance between the mirror and the orientation of both mirror if this difference be simply linear and the mirror be perfectly align then haidinger fringe will be generate if however the respective mirror have differ orientation which would imply that the mirror be not perfectly align fizeau fringe be generate which can be see in fig 1. it can be thought of a a consequence of two virtual image interfere with one another separate by a particular distance 'white light be the mixture of all visible wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum at the null point the arm of the interferometer be equal in length and thus constructive interference occurs at all of the compose wavelength of 'white light source and white light will be visible at the detector a one move away from the null point there will be very specific constructive and destructive interference produce a colourful interference pattern a can see in fig 2. however a high order of interference be reach there will be common factor of the order of interference of the various wavelength compose white light which will lead to a match of interference which lead to a disappearance in the interference pattern a a result white light have a short coherence length of about 10µm the two 'white light source use have significant difference in their composition and construction white lead 's can be construct in several way with the most common type compose of a blue or uv lead with phosphor material help to create the white light spectrum on the other hand the stabilise tungsten halogen light source provide a constant black body radiation spectrum that range from 360 to 2600nm 5 this source therefore can be described by where b be the spectral radiance h be plank 's constant k b be the boltzmann constant c be the speed of light ν be the frequency of the em radiation and t be the temperature in kelvin when the interference pattern be detect by the photodiode an interferogram be produce this can take to determine the coherence length of the source which be simply the range over which the interferometer can scan before the resolution of the interferogram becomes too poor to measure and 'white noise be only detect an interferogram like any time dependent signal can be fourier transform to reveal information about the signal the fourier transform of a real time dependent function f t be where g ω be a function of angular frequency for a monochromatic source with infinitely thin spectral width a delta function δ ω will be produce the spectral line generate from a lamp should take the form of an approximate gaussian which can be express a with α be a constant 6 it can be see from fig 3 that the broader the spectral width of a source the thinner the interferogram and thus the shorter the coherence length the spectral width of a source can be calculate without the use of fourier analysis use the formula where ∆v be the spectral width measure in hz and l be the coherence length in meter the spectral width be related to σ for a gaussian for the coherence length this relationship can easily be obtain by measure the fwhm of the coherence length where the fwhm be the full width at half maximum for the interferogram and σ be the standard deviation of the same distribution which be equivalent to the spectral width of the source fig 3. illustration show a spectrum for a give source and their respective interferograms 7 from this the wavelength can be calculate without fourier analysis to be where c be the speed of light in a vacuum λ be the mean wavelength and ∆λ be the difference in wavelength across the spectrum fig 4 show a basic set up for the type of interferometer use in this investigation this type of interferometer consists of 5 main component the first of these be the source which can be mount inside a collimation package or can be place inside the v-block clamp this then lead to the cube beam splitter in which one of the side be coat in a reflective dielectric material which allows the light to be split and then recombine the two mirror have different system of movement which both have their u m 2 help with the alignment of the interferometer by provide two degree of freedom in order to generate the desire haidinger fringe mirror m 1 do not have this type of movement and so keep the fringe at a constant inclination the detector provide have an amplifier which be useful when certain light source have a low intensity than others the first procedure that have to be carry out be the alignment of the interferometer use a collimate green laser this involve align both of the laser spot so that they be directly over one another on the output arm this alignment can be make well by extend the distance of the output arm perfectly overlap the two light spot give a explain previously haidinger interference after the alignment process the null point have to be found this would be the point around which all interferograms would be take initially the difference in distance between the two orthogonal interferometer arm t be large the distance t be then reduce which cause the fringe pattern to move inwards towards the centre of the haidinger interference pattern a t → 0 the fringe become wider until only the central fringe be visible if t → −∞ the fringe move outwards until the central fringe becomes too small to measure 9 this provide a framework to find the null point due to the short coherence length of white light this be use to fine tune the location after the collimate laser have found it to the near 0.1mm after this the detector could be put in place and a series of measurement could take place it be important to scan over one coherence length to provide a complete spectral measurement whilst also scan with an appropriate resolution for the interferogram to be useful iv result and analysis fig 5 show an interferogram for a white lead scan across the entirety of the coherence length it be clear to see that this interferogram be not purely compose of a continuous distribution of wavelength due to some inflection in the interferogram like that see at -0.918. the approximate coherence length obtain from fig be 11µm ±1.84µm after the interferogram of the lead have be take a fourier transform could be perform a see if fig 6. two peak can clearly be see with these have peak wavelength of 441nm ± 51.0nm and 563nm ± 123nm for the first peak from the left and the peak furthest to the right respectively the significance of this result will be realise when the blue lead interferogram and fft be analyse the fft generate from this in fig 8 show a very well define peak with a spectral width of if 4 be use 5.97×10 12 hz±6.99×10 11 hz this lorenzian shape coheres to the concept of natural and doppler broadening 10 the peak wavelength obtain from this fft be 454nm ± 4.00 × 10 −8 m. the above result be significant due to the way in which the white lead 's be construct for this experiment the small of the two wavelength found in fig 6 have an associate error that lie within the range of the wavelength found from the fft of a blue lead a be expect 9 show two fft for a tungsten halogen light source with either a green or yellow filter affixed onto the light source once again similar to the blue lead the peak be lorentzian in character both peak be split in similar way at their top this make find λ peak especially challenge these two peak be found to be 530nm ± 3.00 × 10 −8 m for the green filter and 572nm ± 3.50 × 10 8 m for the yellow filter the filter use for this fft be band pa filter which would explain why there discontinuity either side of the peak these filter have central wavelength of 580nm±2nm for the yellow filter and 543.5nm ± 2nm for the green filter use 11 the range of the yellow filter measurement indeed lie within this range however the peak wavelength measure for the green filter do not lie within this range one explanation could be the fact that the green filter cause a large drop in intensity which would lead to a great uncertainty in the signal detect by the photodiode for the tungsten source without a filter a narrow interferogram be produce with a coherence length of 14µm ± 2.83. a this be a slightly large coherence length than for the white lead one would expect a very slightly narrower fft fig 11 show both the fft of the interferogram in fig 10 and the theoretical black body curve use both 1 and wein 's displacement law simply from observation the first portion of the black body curve in the ultraviolet spectrum move in some way like the signal they both peak a expect however when λ λ peak the two curve 'diverge and then recombine this be down to the range a the photodiode can not detect em in the infared the final light source analyse be a mercury discharge lamp the emission spectrum of a mercury lamp include a green line of wavelength 546.074nm and a yellow doublet of 576.959nm and 579.065nm 12 fig 12 show two distinct peak with well define splitting on both peak these peak however appear to be shorter wavelength than expect with the high two peak have wavelength of 540nm ± 50nm and 526nm ± 45nm with this large calculate error this indeed could be the yellow doublet however the small of the peak with a wavelength of 526nm ± 34nm this clearly be not the green line consider the success of the previous measurement some random error must have occur or the equipment be use in such a way to find a new fault there be a multitude of different explanation that could diagnose some of the problem face with this investigation and help to explain why some measurement like that of the tungsten with the green filter and the mercury discharge lamp be unsuccessfully take one possible explanation for any such problem be the concept of motor backlash backlash be when a motor loses motion which a a result lead to a discrepancy between the command position the position displayed on the computer and the actual position of the motor 13 other way of improve the result obtain would come from increase the sample size of some of our measurement a for some interferograms use like the one obtain for the green and yellow filter the interferogram be not smooth and sinusoidal like what be expect this may have produce smoother peak without asymmetry the information that be gain from the interferograms obtain through the use of a michelson interferometer prove for the most part to be very useful which render this experiment a success the interferograms for the lead 's measure prove to be successful and generate correct value tungsten prove to also be successful produce encourage fft 's the error encounter be most likely down to the mechanical shortcoming of the motor and it lack of consistency

64,2ndINT_ICG798_Redacted,michelson interferometer be use a a fast fourier transform spectroscope to analyse a white light tungsten source and a mercury discharge lamp the wavelength of 457±25nm for white light tungsten be accurate a well a the mercury discharge lamp with a green filter of 542.9±50nm the top hat function of the yellow filter be reconstruct for the tungsten light source give a peak and the mercury discharge lamp with a yellow filter observe the expect beating pattern from the doublet spectrum t his experiment u the michelson interferometer a a fast fourier transform spectroscope to examine the property of a tungsten light source and mercury discharge lamp the michelson interferometer be invent by albert michelson and be famously use in the michelson-morley experiment which disprove the presence of an ether in 1887 1 more recently it be use in ligo to make the first observation of gravitational wave 2 the michelson interferometer be adjust to have one movable mirror in order to use it a a spectroscope spectroscopy be fundamental in our understand of the universe a it allows for the analysis of the structure and composition of matter the michelson interferometer can be amend for use a a spectroscope by make one of the mirror moveable a show in figure 1. light be split into two beam by a partiallysilvered mirror beamsplitter the two branch of light travel via path a and b to their respective mirror and be reflect back to the beamsplitter where they be recombine this light be then detect by the photodetector which be compose of a photodiode and amplifier the moveable mirror be mount on a motorise stage and allows for a path difference to occur there be a path difference when the light travel along path a have to travel far than b due to a movement of the position of the stage when the path difference be zero or a multiple of the wavelength of light then the two beam of light will interfere constructively and if the path difference be half the wavelength of light then there will be destructive interference thus a mirror m1 move the two light branch go in and out of phase create an interference pattern at the detector the detector be connect to a linux terminal where an interferogram of the data be observe when the `` take data `` command be initiate to obtain the electromagnetic spectrum of the interferogram a fourier transform be take to decompose the signal into it frequency the dielectric plate on the beamsplitter in figure 1 result in the phase change of one of the beam of light meaning at zero path difference the light will interfere destructively the null point be where the mirror m1 and m2 be equidistant to the beamsplitter and the path difference be zero like in figure 1 form a central dark fringe on the detector scan about this point be what make the michelson interferometer into a spectrometer there be two type of interference pattern show in figure 2 that can be observe on the detector haidinger fringe and fizeau fringe fizeau fringe be of equal straight thickness and appear to be close to the mirror on the other hand haidinger fringe appear to be at infinity and produce a pattern of concentric circle 4 these be most useful for find the null point from the interferogram several piece of data can be found such a the mean wavelength λ and the coherence length l which be a measure of the spectral quality of a light source 3 the coherence length can be found by assume the light source be gaussian and take it standard deviation σ a the coherence length more practically this can be found use the full width at half maximum fwhm of the interferogram in the follow equation fig 2. on the left example of haidinger fringe 4 on the right example of fizeau fringe 5 this can be use to find the spectral width of frequency ∆ν which be a measure of the range of frequency the light source emits here c be the speed of light furthermore the spectral width can be convert into a unit of wavelength to find the spectral width of the wavelength ∆λ the tungsten light source emits black body radiation and so wien 's displacement law can be use to find it temperature t during emission this be compare to the mercury discharge lamp which have set energy level which the electron can excite and decay between emit photon a they fall to low energy state in this way the mercury lamp should produce clear spectral line to show the quantisation of energy the lamp also emits uv which be of a shorter wavelength than the tungsten light which emits visible light have construct the michelson interferometer a a spectroscope in figure 1 we then align it we do this by use the green laser a it have a narrow beam we first make sure the distance between the mirror and beamsplitter be the same use a ruler so that they would align close to where there would be a central dark fringe we make sure the mirror be perpendicular to the beamsplitter with the dot of green laser light center in the middle of each mirror by make sure the light source be on the optical axis the angle of the non-moveable mirror be adjustable so we be able to tilt the mirror so that it reflect light overlap the light from the other mirror on the photodetector we then want to find the null point the position of the stage where we observe the dark central haidinger fringe we do this by two method the first be to continue use the green laser and add a lens to find the range of stage position where the haidinger fringe seem to change direction and where they be the straightest after have found this range we then switch the light source to a white lead with a diffuser the null point be found on the interferogram by a clear peak in the signal we then decrease the range of stage movement to focus on this area where a rainbow of light be observe on the photodetector and a black spot at the exact null point however this method be slow a the range determine by the green laser to find the null point in be not accurate a we found the null point just outside this range the second more refine method that we use be to scan the white lead signal over a long range at the minimum sample rate where interference be still observe the rate be calculate by consider the photodetector which sample at a frequency of 50hz and the white lead of 10µm coherence length result in a motor speed of 0.05mms −1 over the long scan a peak be see we then narrow the range of the moveable mirror position to get a clear image of the interference pattern this method be faster and so be our prefer method have found the null point we then take interferograms about this point to characterise the light source white light tungsten and a mercury discharge lamp we also take interferograms of the light source with a green and yellow filter on to find the average and peak wavelength of the light source we take a fft with the x-axis a oscillation per step we then take the positive part of the ft and convert the data from oscillation per step to step per oscillation and found the time per step size from this and assume the signal be gaussian we found the peak wavelength and average wavelength the coherence length spectral width and the wien temperature of the white light tungsten use equation 1 4 we also reproduce the shape of the filter function for yellow light tungsten by take an inverse ft of the interferogram for the mercury discharge lamp with the green filter we found the wavelength of the singlet and test the reproducibility of the distance move by the stage by plot wavelength against stage position for the yellow filter we analyse the doublet spectrum by consider the noise that result in the low resolution data scan around the null point with the white lead produce the flow of a beautiful rainbow pattern show in figure 3. the rainbow begin with blue and yellow stripe since these colour have the shortest wavelength and continued to become more intense in colour add the colour red of longer wavelength in image 6 and 7. the rainbow pattern be observe due to white light be compose of different colour of light have different wavelength and so have different path difference this mean the colour interfere at different position of the stage movement a the null point be approach the path difference begin to align so that at the null point a black dot be observe a all colour interfere destructively the interferogram for white light tungsten around the null point be show in figure 4. there be a clear peak in the interference at the null point with an almost symmetric shape we found the null point to be at the stage position 0.633±5×10 −4 mm the data we obtain from the white light tungsten be displayed in table i. our value 457nm±25nm for the average wavelength be within the expect range of the tungsten lamp broadband of 360-2600nm 6 we have obtain reasonable value except for the 6.34k temperature of tungsten which be extremely low the specification state that the temperature should be 2796±15k so the data varies by a factor of 186. a possible reason for this could be that we approximate the tungsten light source to have a gaussian shape interferogram but in figure 4 we see that it be not symmetric this be because the tungsten lamp be actually a black body emitter hence our assumption affect the accuracy of our result there be also experimental source of error due to noise and the non-linear motion of the motorise stage to check if the asymmetry of 4 be due to the motor movement we take interferograms of the stage move in both direction past the null point we observe the same asymmetry ruling out the direction of stage movement a a cause we test the tungsten lamp to see if there be a variation in signal intensity but it be constant with 0 standard deviation this aligns with specification of the tungsten lamp have less than 0.05 output power stability there could be contribution of external light affect the interference pattern a well a misalignment of the mirror cause not all light to overlap however we thought the error be more fundamental than this and so we test the reproducibility of the stage motor with the mercury discharge lamp with a green filter the interferograms of the tungsten light with a green and yellow filter on be show in figure 5 where we observe a diminish beating pattern the filter transform the signal pattern into that of a sinc function described by x otherwise this be because the filter act a top hat function which be then fourier transform into sinc function on the interferogram therefore we can take an inverse ft of the interferograms to find the shape of the filter to do this we have to first perform a hilbert transformation to fit the envelope of the beating shape in 5. we use the fit from the envelope to do the inverse ft. we do this process for the yellow filter tungsten and compare it to the inverse ft of a simple sinc function show in 6. a we can see from the graph our experimental data do n't produce the expect top hat shape but a clear peak we expect to see gibb 's phenomenon of over and undershoot at the discontinuity however it be unclear if there be any in the experimental graph at the base or if this be just noise the restriction of light allow to pa by the green filter be show by the peak and zero magnitude outside the interferogram of the mercury discharge lamp be show in figure 7. on the left side of the graph we can see that the jagged line be produce because the motor briefly jolt forward and backwards before it move more smoothly in the instruct direction from take several reading we found that it be important to keep the lamp on so that we do n't take any reading where it be `` warm up `` a this process be visible in the strength of signal produce there be a lot of noise on the interferogram so not much can be see however when we fft it we decompose the signal to see it wavelength there be a broad spectrum of wavelength in 8 show that the data take be very noisy we found the maximum wavelength of the light to be 542.9nm this be in the range of the expect value of wavelength allow to pa through the green filter of 543.5±2nm 7 we expect a gaussian shape for figure 8 but it be slightly asymmetric we think this be because the position of the mirror on the stage be at a different place to where it say it be and thus due to the motor there be an error on all measurement the error from the motor be best show in figure 9 where we expect a constant wavelength yet there appear to be a periodic pattern of wavelength this clearly show that the motor do not move smoothly a the manufacturer claim but move in small step the pattern be most likely due to the coil in the motor give a systematic error which we quantify to 25nm for each wavelength calculate the interferogram of the mercury discharge lamp with a yellow filter show a beating pattern in figure 10. the beating pattern be due to the doublet produce in the spectrum once a fft be perform on the interferogram due to noise it be not possible to resolve the two spectral line however a graph of their wavelength could be obtain show in figure 11. the two wavelength be found by take the maximum wavelength of each peak give 585nm and 671nm a reason for the heavy noise on the mercury data could have be due to the relative sensitivity of the photodetector accord to it specification the detector be most sensitive to light of wavelength around 900nm which be in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum we can see from the graph in figure 12 that the sensitivity be less than 20 in the uv region hence to improve the accuracy of our result we should consider use a photodetector more sensitive to shorter wavelength a a result we need the gain on our detector to be a high a possible to improve resolution of the interferograms another source of noise for the mercury discharge lamp be the variation in intensity of the light source itself this be show clearly by figure 13 where we see a large spread in intensity and significantly a wide peak this be confirm by the standard deviation calculate to be 15.22 and the average wavelength show on the graph at 139.54 give a standard error of 0.317. sum the error from the motor movement detector sensitivity and the mercury discharge lamp intensity variation we put the error on our wavelength at 50nm we use the michelson interferometer a a spectrometer to characterise a tungsten light source and mercury discharge lamp we found the null point use a white lead where we observe the splitting of the light to produce a colourful flow interference pattern we found the wavelength of white light tungsten to be 457±25nm which agrees with the manufacturer 's specification but be far out of range for the calculate temperature of tungsten we reconstruct the shape of the yellow filter on the tungsten light source where we obtain a peak rather than a top hat shape from analysis of the mercury discharge lamp with a green filter we be able to quantise the error on our data from the motor a 25nm we also found the wavelength to be 542.9±50nm which be in the expect range of the green filter broadband lastly we found the wavelength of the mercury discharge lamp with a yellow filter a 585±50nm and 671±50nm to improve this experiment i would use a detector more sensitive to uv light for the mercury discharge lamp data and use a stage which move at a linear speed,prediction,the,65,0.607392728,0.392607301

appropriate correct for mercury lamp data displayed a large amount of noise in the reading and thus the detector use be deem unsuitable for the analysis of this emission i nvented in 1880 the michelson interferometer have form an integral part of many scientific discovery and discipline include special relativity spectroscopy and interferometry 1 the simple set up allows for record of the interference of electromagnetic wave a single light source be input and the beam split use a beamsplitter this be follow by beam recombination with the use of two mirror at the detector the movement of one of the two mirror adjusts the path difference between the two light beam this creates interference pattern from which conclusion can be drawn about the source and it constituent frequency a michelson interferometer be built and use to analyze four different type of light source with vary filter these include a green laser two lead a mercury lamp and a tungsten lamp the filter use be green and yellow the variation in light production technique and coherence among source allow for analysis of the suitability of this interferometer for different situation a schematic of a michelson interferometer be show in fig 1. when a beam of light be incident on a beamsplitter it be split into two separate beam one reflect one transmit the reflect beam a travel to mirror m1 and back and the transmit beam b travel to mirror m2 and back for the extend source use in this investigation the interference pattern be dependent on the angle θ between the incoming fig 1 a michelson interferometer m1 and m2 be mirror m2 represent equivalent position of m2 in a parallel setup d be the distance between the beamsplitter and closest mirror and t be difference in parallel position of the mirror 2 p.4 ray and the optical axis through basic trigonometric manipulation it can be see that difference in path length φ of the two beam be where t be the difference in length of the interferometer arm a show this path difference cause interference upon beam recombination the principle of linear superposition state constructive interference occurs when φ be an integer multiple of wavelength and complete destructive interference occurs when φ be an integer plus a half wavelength the interference pattern vary with orientation of the mirror if m1 and m2 be at perfect right angle concentric circular ring call haidinger fringe will be see if they be not at right angle symmetry will be broken and straight bright line of uniform thickness form call frizeau fringe the interferometer may be use a a spectrometer when the distance between the two mirror be approximately equal the null point when use monochromatic light this be see a haidinger fringe reduce to a singularity 3 by take measurement close to the null point the coherence length l of a source may be see on an interferogram though a precise definition of coherence length be not give this be the length over which one arm of the michelson interferometer may be scan before the contrast of the interferogram becomes poor the spectral width ∆ν of the source be a measure of the range of frequency emit by the source and be where c be the speed of light and l be in metre spectral width be measure in hz 2 wavelength can be found by fourier transform of the interferogram an electromagnetic wave with electric field strength e may be express in the form where r be the position vector ω be angular frequency and t be time k be the wave vector whose modulus be 2πν where ν be inverse wavelength or wavenumber use euler 's identity the time dependant part of this function may be represent a a summation of trignometric function ie the potential for representation of any function use sine and cosine allows for fourier transform 4 the shape of an interferogram be dependant on the frequency present and the amplitude or intensity of each frequency the intensity of a signal be proportional to the square of it amplitude the interferogram contains all physical information about a wave fourier transform be use to make interferograms directly interpretable though provide no extra information a fourier transform f ω of the interferogram function in the time domain f t be use to represent data in the frequency domain these two function form a fourier transform pair and be related by this fourier transform return both positive and negative frequency the negative frequency be due to contribution from the imaginary part of the wave take an inverse function of positive frequency reconstructs the original wavelength spectrum fourier transform be carry out on a computer use summation over a large but finite number of point n 5 an interferometer be built follow the configuration in fig 1. the two mirror use be a manually adjust kinematic mirror and a motorize mirror adjust through input command in the linus terminal a thorlab 30 mm cage cube-mounted non-polarizing beamsplitter be use manufacturer specification describe a dielectric anti-reflective coat apply face with a great transmission tolerance to wavelength in the 400 -700 nm range the dielectric coat cause a phase change for one beam lead to destructive interference at zero path difference and constructive interference when λ 2 6 the silicon pin photodiode dectector use have a detection range of 400 -1100nm 7 light source be mount on a v-clamp depend on the intensity of the light source plano-convex lens of focal length 24.5 and 100.0mm be insert between source and beamsplitter to widen beam and between beamsplitter and detector to refocus the alignment of the interferometer be checked and adjust use green laser light point beam be project onto a screen place in front of the detector and the kinematic mirror move until fizeau fringe be see a magnify lens be then insert and the motorize mirror adjust until a minimum of haidinger fringe be see a white light source be then insert and an interferogram take the peak of this interferogram be indicative of a null point at the position −0.6663 ± 0.0005mm and all subsequent data be take in a 100µm range about this point the velocity of the motorize mirror be set to 0.5µms −1 theoretical calculation use the nyquist theorem 4 of the minimum speed imply a much great speed may be use however a the oscillation record by the interferogram do not form perfect sine wave many more than two data point per oscillation be necessary to ensure complete information the velocity of the mirror be also slow to reduce beating between frequency present beating be a result of the superposition of the two interference pattern this beating form an envelop function that corrupt the data follow collection of data interferograms be plot and gaussian fit overlaid the coherence length be deduce to be roughly equal to the full width half maximum of the gaussian curve and from this spectral width calculate where appropriate mean wavelength be found use a similar gaussian-overlay method on the fourier transform and estimate the mean value in case where this be not possible a value be estimate use visual approximation fourier transform spectroscopy approximates light source a point source in many case this be a good approximation however it would be beneficial to insert a small aperture between the source and the beamsplitter fig 2 show an example interferogram table 1 show key result relate to property of light source error be usually calculate through visual estimation of goodness of fit where wavelength be a single value this be the mean wavelength take at peak spectral intensity and error be the standard deviation approximate through a gaussian fit for the blue lead it be possible to computationally fit a gaussian function this produce a covarence matrix from which error parameter be found where wavelength be a range of value this be the range over which there be high spectral intensity error on the coherence length of the white lead be high due to the presence of a secondary gaussian envelope function on the interferogram error on the coherence length of unfiltered tungsten be high due minimal peak in the secondary gaussian lead to highly subjective fitting of the gaussian overlay the coherence length for the mercury lamp be not present due to excessive noise in data no data be take for unfiltered mercury this would be beneficial a a comparative tool the range of wavelength detect whilst use green and yellow filter on the tungsten and mercury lamp be surpasses what be expect for the respective light range despite this clear cut off frequency be demonstrate by the sharp depreciation in spectral intensity at the edge of the allow range a show in fig 4. far discussion on filter be in present in section 4b the white lead exhibit two peak of wavelength a show in fig 3 with wavelength document in table 1. this be indicative of the lead be make up of a monochromatic light source and fluorescent phosphorous coat the agreement of wavelength within range of error of the blue peak of the white lead and the blue lead imply similar source be use when look at the white lead the light emit be obviously non-uniform imply vary thickness in the phosphorus coat a ground glass diffuser be add between the source and beamsplitter in an attempt to minimize this inconsistency and blend frequency despite this when compare interferograms of the light with and without the diffuser no significant change be see it would be beneficial to reduce the aperture of the incident white light use a pin hole to ensure uniformity the coherence length of colour source be see to be large than for white light in most case this be due to the extensive superposition of multiple wave of different frequency a show by large spectral width for white light source many frequency be superimpose to contribute to the final pulse on the interferogram a the number of contribute frequency to a source tends to infinity the resultant pulse of intensity in the time domain narrow the tungsten lamp produce a black body emission spectrum partially show in fig 5 with a peak at 845 ± 10nm use wien 's displacement law where t be absolute temperature of the source the temperature of the tungsten lamp be found to be 3420 ± 40k this value be outside the range expect 2500 -3300 k however it be important to note that the nature of emission of a blackbody mean wavelength deep into the infrared will be emit and will give rise to intensity peak outside of the detector 's sensitivity so this peak in intensity in the visible zone should be treat with some skepticism 8 the majority of discharge of a mercury lamp be in the ultraviolet zone 10 and thus not picked up by the detector this be due to the de-excitation of electron from quantize energy level cause highly energetic photon emission emission in the visible zone be weak and thus highly susceptible to noise when record this be demonstrate by fig 4a data take for mercury be include however should be treat with caution for this reason the expect presence of a doublet under the cut of frequency be demonstrate by sharp decrease in spectral intensity however be different to those expect from manufacturer specification 9 yellow filter be not distinguishable a more sensitive detector be necessary for accurate analysis of mercury emission for low input velocity of the motorize mirror the motion of the mirror be not constant a the input velocity use be 0.5µs −1 the expect positional change between sample be 0.001µm through analysis of a data set of 43422 measurement the mean positional deviation be found to be 1.02 ± 0.64 × 10 −2 µm the error on this result be the standard deviation in addition to this large standard deviation the stage do not move between reading in 4.46 of case this lack of movement demonstrates the lack of suitability of the motorize mirror extensive analysis of light source the inconsistent motion of the mirror may have result in false peak of spectral intensity the beamsplitter use be coat in an anti-reflection coat state to transmit between 40 and 55 of incident light in the wavelength range 400-700nm below this range percentage transmission decay exponentially however above there be a gradual roughly linear decrease the lack of equality between reflection and transmission of wave will effect interference pattern the resultant effect in the fourier transforms have be ignore however quantify resultant error would be beneficial the spectral sensitivity s of the detector be a function of wavelength this lead to a skewed weight and bias towards longer wavelength in the final wavelength fourier transforms of the interferograms through manual fitting of the manufacturer publish graph of spectral

56,2ndINT_QFQ712_Redacted,michelson interferometer be construct and use to record interferograms of a white lead a blue lead a tungsten source and a tungsten with a green filter the null point be found to be at -0.86 mm with 0.005 uncertainty the spectrum of different source be construct from the interferograms and the characteristic of the light source and the filter be analyze in this experiment we investigate how the michelson interferometer produce interference fringe and construct one a a spectrometer then the interferometer be use to record interferograms use source with a variety of spectral composition in mathematics principle the interferogram be essentially a fourier transform of the light source so we can describe the spectrum of the source quantitatively use the interferograms a simulation of different light source and their spectrum be developed to compare with the experimental data optical interferometer can be use a spectrometer for the study of detailed line in a spectrum remarkably the basic structure of ligo 's interferometer which develops gravitaional wave observation be very similar to the michelson interferometer 2 the michelson interferometer be invent by albert araham michelson and it be a common configuration for optical interferometry the setup be show in figure .1. the interferometer produce interference fringe by splitting a monochromatic light so that the reflect beam a travel to a movable mirror and the transmit bean b travel to a fix mirror the beam splitter have a partially silver surface and a dielectric plate when the beam be partially reflect at the mirror and brought back together at the detector an interference pattern result the ray diagram from an observer 's perspective be show in fig 2. the path difference between distance travel by a fig 2 the ray diagram from an observer 's perspective 1 and b be t d−d m2 be where the mirror m2 appear to be when the path difference be multiple of m 2 λ where m be odd number the beam interfere constructively when m be even number the beam interfere destructively so we obtain where θ be the angle make by the incoming ray and m be the order of interference this equation show the relation between θ and the order of interference fig 3 formation of interference fringe in the michelson interferometer 3 the nature of the fringe observe by u depends on whether two mirror be properly align the fringe can be interpret a the result of interference between light come from tow virtual image s 1 and s 2 of the original source in fig 3a m1 and m 2 be parallel which mean the mirror be perfectly align the result interference pattern be circle center normal to the mirror it be call haidinger fringe in fig 3.b m1 and m 2 be tilt the cylindrical symmetry be broken m1 and m 2 have interference fringe of hyperbola shape and the overlap of the mirror give straight parallel and equally space fringe near the axis this be call the fizeau fringe fourier transforms decomposes a signal a function of time into frequency that make it up an interferogram temporal be transform to a spectrum spectral through the principle of fourier transform for a single monochromatic wave we observe a sinusoidal fringe which be a delta function in frequency space for two monochromatic wave of distinct frequency the interferogram be the sum of the two sinusoidal fringe with different time period a show in fig 4. at equal arm length m=0 two fringe pattern be exactly in phase a one fringe with longer wavelength move away from that point it will catch up with the other fringe at some point and the two wave will be exactly in phase again that be why a beating pattern appear in the interferogram a show in fig 5. there be a reciprocal relationship between the separation between the null in the interferogram and the separation of the two frequency in the frequency space which be a direct consequence of fourier transform the spectral line shape of a monochromatic light source such a a blue lead be approximately gaussian where v 0 be the mean frequency and σ be the standard deviation accord to fourier theory a gaussian spectral feature lead to a gaussian temporal feature interferogram the reciprocal relationship be demonstrates again a a consequence of fourier theory that a narrow spectral line lead to a wide gaussian interferogram and vice versa a show in fig 6. the coherence length be the propagation distance over which the light wave resembles a sinusoidal 4 it describes the spectral quality of a light source partially speak it measure the distance over which one arm of a michelson interferometer can be scan before the quality becomes poor 1 the relation between the spectral width and the coherence length be give below where ∆v be the spectral width hz of the spectrum and l be the coherence length m the spectral width be associate to the wavelength width 1 where λ be the mean wavelength m of the light source and ∆λ be the width of wavelength m the relation between the full width half maximum fwhm and σ of a gaussian be the σ of a gaussian fit to a interferogram can refer to the coherence length and the σ of a gaussian fit to a spectrum can refer to the spectral width ∆λ which can use to calculate l use equation 3 and 4 the experimental procedure consists of three main part construct an interferometer find the null point and character different light source we construct the interferometer use the arrangement of the michelson interferometer a described previously the set up be show in fig 7. to align the component of the interferometer a green laser be use we firstly fix the position of m1 and put the beam splitter parallel to m1 and at the same height these two component be align when the reflection beam from m1 merge with the beam come out of the beam splitter then repeat the same for m2 and the beam splitter the tilt of m2 be adjust in order to have two spot from the two arm of the interferometer on top of each other about 1 meter away from the beam splitter an interference pattern be observe then a 25mm lens which have a long focal length be put fig 7 the set up of the construct interferometer between source and the beam splitter to enlarge the fringe pattern the stage be move by use the take-data function in the terminal in linux the three parameter be the position of the stage move to the rate of stage movement and the sample size we chose a rate that be not too fast for the oscillation of the stage to disturb the signal or too slow and inefficient the sample size be chosen to be sufficient in represent the data the spectrum be reconstruct by perform fast fourier transforms fft on the interferogram use python they be compare to reference literature to check their accuracy the null point be the point at which t=0 the arm length be exactly the same at the null point we found the null point by use the green laser and the white lead consecutively the closer the stage be to the null point the few number of dark and bright fringe be observe accord to equation 1 a long range of the stage be scan through and we narrow it down to the range where the fringe number be small a the position of the stage approach the null point the fringe disappear into the center a the position of the stage move away from the null point the fringe appear out of the center use this property we found the null point within 0.2 mm the white lead be then use because the white light fringe can only be see at the null point the reason for it be that white lead cover a board range of wavelength and the probability of all the wave be in phase be very small except at the null point the stage be then scan through the reduce length and the null point be found we characterize different light source and filter by take interferograms of a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten white light with a green filter for 0.1mm range around the null point the mean wavelength of each source be calculate by zoom in on the interferogram record the length around 10 wavelength and calculate the mean the assumption be that the distance between sample be constant the coherence length be measure use a combination of method we measure the range of the interferomgram where the signal be sinusoidal alternatively we fit a gaussian function for a spectrum measure the full width half maximum fwhm and calculate the σ of the gaussian from equation 5 and hence obtain the value of coherence length the null point of the interferometer be at -0.860mm with 0.005 uncertainty a show in fig 8 the white light source give a very sharp line at the null point so the uncertainty be very small the spectrum of a white lead a blue lead a white light tungsten and a white light tungsten with a green filter be analyze by fitting a gaussian function to each spectrum the value of fwhm of the gaussian be measure and σ the coherence length l and the spectral width ∆v be calculate use equation 3 4 and 5 these value be only an approximation for u to take data since the formula assumes a gaussian while the actual shape of each source be not the two main source of uncertainty be the alignment of the interferometer and the non-linear movement of the stage the alignment ensures the transmit and reflect beam to be near 100 overlap the non-linear movement would be measure a a displacement which interrupt the amplitude of the signal a well a shift the interferogram the spectrum of the white lead source use fast fourier transform be show in fig 8. the offset which be the background noise be read from the interferogram be 0.88 a.u .. we fig 9 spectrum of the white lead source use fft can see that the spectrum peak at λ 1 =457 nm and λ 2 =577nm λ 1 be in the range of green color wavelength the amplitude be significantly high in the range of λ=520nm to λ=640nm which be in the range of red and green color 5 this indicates that white lead be actually make of three domain color blue red and green which match with theory when we perceive white light it be actually come from a combination of wavelength of blue red and green or blue and yellow 6 so the white light produce by lead be combine red blue and green lead or use a blue lead with a phosphor coat to convert blue light to white light by a process call fluorescence 7 since the amplitude be high in the red wavelength region than the blue wavelength range the light would be perceive a warm white the spectrum of the tungsten white light source be produce use fft with offset 0.65 a.u a show in fig 10 .. the tungsten light source be approximately a black body radiation which can be described use planck 's law a show in fig 11. however the sensitivity of the photodiode in the be only sufficient over the from 400 nm to 1100 nm which be around the visible region 8 the photodiode also have a fig 11 black body radiation at 3000k 9 directional sensitivity characteristic which mean it be more responsive to beam normal to the surface than others so the fft spectrum only show the visible part of a black body radiation and the other part be cut off wien 's displacement law state that where t be the temperature k and λ peak be the maximum wavelength m the temperature of tungsten white light calculate be 3620 ± 50k a green filter be use to transmit a define wavelength band of light while reject other unwanted radiation the mathematical principle be a convolution of a black body radiation and a bound region the green filter be also use to broaden the coherence length of a light source by 37.5 which be due to the reciprocal relationship between ∆λ and coherence length l. the filter we use act a a band-pass filter and have gaussian property with mean wavelength 543.5 ± 2 nm and fwhm 10 ± 2 nm 10 these two graph be symmetric about the centre which demonstrates a direction of the peak of the spectrum associate with the two side of the filter they show the spike be not the result of noise in the signal but very likely to be the manufacture property of the green filter in this experiment we construct a michelson interferometer to take measurement of a variety of light source such a white lead blue lead tungsten white light and tungsten light with a green filter the null point of the interferometer be found to be at -0.860 mm with 0.005 uncertainty the interferogram

the spectrum the spectrum of the white lead indicates the nature of white light be a combination of red blue and green light the tungsten light source be approximately a black body at temperature= 3620 ± 50 k. the green filter be show to broaden the coherence length by 37.5 and to transmit light in a want wavelength range we also found the filter be not behaving like an ideal gaussian a

underpin many physical phenomenon it be use famously in 1887 in the michelson-morley experiment to disprove the theory of the luminiferous ether since it have be greatly refine and in 2015 be use in the ligo experiment to observe the first gravitational wave in this experiment we use the michelson interferometer to investigate the characteristic of different light source we use a green lead source to align the interferometer and locate the null point -the position at which light observes the mirror a be equidistant from the source we observe that at this point haidinger fringe appear to stop move inwards and start move outwards from the central maximum we use a detector to measure the amplitude of the signal produce when mirror 2 m2 be move across a small region surround the null point for each of the light source use the fourier transform of these interferograms we be able to measure the mean wavelength and spectral width of the emission spectrum of the light source and be far able to measure their coherence length for the white light tungsten source we be also able to determine it operating temperature ii theory a michelson interferometer consists of a light source a beam splitter two mirror and a detector in a set-up illustrate in fig 1. the beam splitter divide the light from the source into two beam direct to either mirror one side of the mirror have a dielectric plate which change the phase of one of these beam in such a way that when there be zero path difference between the mirror destructive interference occurs the wave interfere at the beam splitter and pa towards the detector where the signal amplitude be measure m2 be set in motion and the signal amplitude change a the path difference change the detector be connect to a computer which plot the interferogram if the mirror be at right angle to one another and the beam splitter be align correctly then the parallel light ray appear to be come from infinity and circular fringe know a haidinger fringe be visible if the mirror be slightly tilt relative to one another the ray appear to come from an extend source reflect by two mirror separate by a fix distance and fizeau fringe be visible the location of the maximum of the signal be govern by 1 where 𝑡 be the separation of m1 and m2 𝜃 be the angle of incidence of the ray at the mirror and 𝑚 be the order of the maximum see vii appendix for derivation a filter have an associate bandwidth which be transmit when a light source be project through it ideally this would have a square form where each wavelength within the bandwidth be completely transmit however this be unrealistic and the filter we use have a gaussian transmission form the green filter transmits a mean wavelength of 543.5 ± 2 𝑛𝑚 with s 4.2 ± 0.8 𝑛𝑚 the yellow filter transmits a mean wavelength of 580 ± 2 𝑛𝑚 coherence length be a of the distance over which one arm of a michelson interferometer can be scan before the interferogram contrast becomes poor 2 theoretically speak for path difference great than the coherence length the phase difference become random 3 the coherence length be related to the spectral width by where ∆𝑣 be the spectral width -a measure of the range of frequency emit by the source since we fourier investigate the characteristic of different light source and filter transform the interferogram into wavelength space we must convert the wavelength width to spectral width use the follow relation where δ𝜆 be the wavelength width and 𝜆 be the mean wavelength prior to construct the interferometer we simulated the interferogram and wavelength spectrum that we would expect for a white light source and a blue lead these be displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively the wavelength spectrum of the white light source be a gaussian encompass all wavelength in the visible spectrum the relatively wide spectral width give rise to the narrow interferogram on the other hand the blue lead have a very narrow spectral width and so have a much wider interferogram this follow directly from 2 during the construction of the interferometer we make sure that the mirror be roughly equidistant from beam splitter so that the null point laid within the movable range of m2 we connect a green lead source and the beam splitter via a convex lens with a focal length of 25.4 𝑚𝑚 to widen the light from the lead and a matte black lens tube of length 54.6 𝑚𝑚 to reduce interference from the reflect light precaution to avoid interference from reflect ray with the ray directly leave the source be take by place dark card diagonally between the component the detector be temporarily substitute for a screen on which the interference fringe be align by tile m1 the narrow spectral width of an lead mean that the interference fringe can be observe over the entire moveable range of the green lead when haidinger fringe be visible throughout the entire range of movement the mirror be sufficiently well align to locate the null point we low the mirror speed sufficiently so that we could observe the movement of the fringe if the detector be move in the direction of the null point the fringe appear to converge into the central maximum a govern by 1 when move towards the null point 𝑡 → 0 and so co 𝜃 get large and so 𝜃 → 0 result in the ray appear to come from infinity by observe the motion of the fringe in a give direction about particular point along the range of m2 we be able to locate the null point within a range of ~0.25 𝑚𝑚 then use the interferogram and white lead we be able to locate the null point at 2.990 ± 0.01 𝑚𝑚 due to the relatively large spectral width of a white lead the interference fringe only appear very close the null point use the method described in iii method we measure the interferogram and wavelength spectrum of the white lead see in the fig 4. an rgb lead that generates white light have contribution from three component of light red green and blue thus correspond to a sum of three gaussians since the red and green curve be not distinguishable we have only fit two gaussian curve the blue gaussian with low amplitude have an average wavelength of 462.7 ± 0.3 nm and the red/green have an average wavelength of 622.5 ± 0.4 nm where the unce1tainty be obtain through evaluate the covariance matrix by weigh the wavelength of the spectrum by the standard deviation and amplitude of the gaussians we can measure the average wavelength a 608.5 ± 0.5 nm the spectral width be equal to the full width at half-maximum fwhm and be calculate use the standard deviation of the wavelength we obtain a value for .1il of 46.9 ± 0.9 nm and 234 ± 1 nm respectively thus give u a total of 281 ± 2 nm fmthe1more use 3 we obtain a .1v measurement of227 ± 1 thz and by 2 a measurement for l of 1.32 ± 0.01 µm the fonn of the interferogram and simulation differ slightly a a result of the difference in the number of gaussian te1ms sum to create the signal they do however both exhibit a spectral width and coherence length the interferogram and wavelength spectrum for the blue lead be show in fig 5. the average wavelength of the blue lead be 457.8 ± 0.1 nm and the standard deviation be 11.7 ± 0.1 nm from this we can obtain a .1v measurement for the blue lead of 39.4 ± 0.3 thz use 2 we measure la 7.61 ± 0.07 µm finally we measm•ed the inteiferograms and wavelength spectrum of the white light tungsten source with green and yellow filter and without a filter these be displayed in fig 6. total word count 2484 -3 first we will discus the result for the filter tungsten light source for the green filter we fit a gaussian to the wavelength spectrum since the expect transmission spectrum of the filter be a gaussian the mean wavelength be 555.2nm ± 0.1 nm and the standard deviation be 18.2 nm ± 0.1 nm we obtain a .1v measurement of 41.7 ± 0.2 thz and use 2 we show l be 7.17 ± 0.06 µm for the yellow filter tungsten light we conduct a similar analysis and measure the mean wavelength of the source a 590.5 nm ± 0.1 nm and the standard deviation a 25.4 nm ± 0.1 nm we measure .1v a 51.4 ± 0.2 thz and use 2 show that l be 5.84 ± 0.19µm for the white light tungsten source we do not fit a gaussian since tungsten source such a incandescent lamp emit a continuous spectmm so we would expect a black body spectrum we can estimate the average temperature of the tungsten filament by apply wien 's displacement law for black body where t be the temperature of the filament a.peak be the wavelength at which the peak of the curve be locate and b be wien 's displacement constant from fig 6 aii we can show that ii.peak be 874.1 nm which corresponds to a temperature of 3320 k. however the curve do not exactly replicate the black body spectrum this be because the curve be the product of a combination of two curve a black body spectium and figure 6 ai show the interferogramfor the white light tungsten source with no filter figure 6 aii show the wavelength spectrum for the

experiment we measure the signal for each source sunounding the null point and use a fast fomier transfonn to deduce the wavelength spectmm that produce the signal through the analysis of the wavelength spectnun we measure the spectral width and coherence length of each source a expect the spectral width of the blue lead be significantly small than that of the total word count 2484 similar wavefo1ms to their simulation the wavelength spectmm of the tungsten source do not replicate the expect black body curve due to the limited range of wavelength that the detector be able to register the green and yellow filter source do take their expect gaussian fonn under an envelope gaussian since the filter be clean before use and we observe similar fonns in both the green and yellow spectrum

be use in combination with a 25.4mm lens la1951-a to broaden the source before the beam splitter and a 100m lens la1509-a after the beam splitter to focus the beam the fringe pattern be observe at a long distance approx 2m to reduce uncertainty the beam splitter be centre and then the kinematic mirror be use to move the fringe until maximum interference be observe the aim be to have a central haidinger fringe in the centre of the pattern if fizeau fringe be present the angle of the kinematic mirror be skewed once align much caution must be use when modify the interferometer so a to not misalign it once more it be important to know the position of the null point of the set-up a it be over this point that the maximum interference pattern be observe with the detector in a position with clear contrast fringe the green laser be use to find a range where the null lie by scan at interval and see if the fringe be disappear into or appear out of the centre the point at which they cross over be the null point once an interval of approximately 0.2mm be found the white light source be place in with a ground glass diffuser dg10-1500-md to remove the conical structure of the lead from the beam and a interferogram be take with a speed 1µms -1 to find the exact location of the null the original location of the null be 6.0785mm this be take a an indicator for each other source the

be worth note that when the lead be in use they must be held in a v-block clamp vc1m and place at 1cm away from the centre of the diffuser when the tungsten light source be be use it must be screw in to the collimator package ac050-008-a-ml the filter can be place directly into the filter holder of the light source use a spanner wrench all source be scan with the 100mm lens in the lens tube for each source a slightly longer interferogram 0.5mm be take at 10µms -1 to find the exact location of the null and then a slow interferogram be take at 1µms -1 over the null the detector take

light pollution the interferometer be place in a black out box and black foam stand be use between the arm the apparatus be secure with clamp fork and the apparatus be regularly clean with isopropanol to ensure the lens and mirror be clear a see in figure 3 the wavelength spectrum have a clear gaussian distribution form the peak wavelength visible from the blue lead be 442 ± 12 nm with the uncertainty be determine from take the average residual in value within 0.5 standard deviation of the fit gaussian from the peak this result in a fwhm of 33 ± 6 and a coherence length of 2.20 ± 0.09 µm for the blue lead the uncertainty in fwhm have be estimate by calculate the average error of the peak and two half-maximums between the data and the fit gaussian the uncertainty in the fwhm and peak wavelength have propagate to the coherence length thus these uncertainty have be add in fractional quadrature to give the final uncertainty these error have mainly arose from the random error in the acceleration of the stage and the uncertainty in it own position 6 furthermore it be physically impossible to have the lead perfectly centre in the lens tube so this creates less precise interference pattern within blue lead the light emit layer be construct of indium gallium nitride ingan 7 the peak wavelength of the blue lead agrees with the expect range for an ingan lead a it be in the low range of blue wavelength and some low energy ultra-violet contribution be expect moreover in comparison to the white source it could be expect that the blue lead have a longer coherence length a the source be more monochromatic from figure 4 the small gaussian have a peak wavelength 453 ± 14 nm and a coherence length of 2.7 ± 0.1 µm and the large gaussian have a peak wavelength of 626 ± 58 nm and a coherence length of 1.000 ± 0.002 µm the low wavelength distribution be comparable to that of the blue lead and the large distribution show contribution from green through to red it be not possible to construct a true white lead a they must consists of a wide wavelength spectrum low coherence length due to this they be make of an ingan lead with a phosphor coat 8 which carry out a stoke 's shift on small wavelength to produce a wide spectrum of visible light figure 4 reinforces this a the spectrum can be see a the combination of a blue lead spectrum and a visible spectrum with a large spectral width the tungsten source can be consider to be a 'near blackbody radiator 10 a see in figure 5 the tungsten light source behave a a white light source with a large spectral width the peak wavelength be measure at 840 ± 125 nm and the coherence length be measure at 0.913 ± 0.0005 µm use equation 6 the temperature of the source be calculate to be 3400 ± 500k which lie just outside of the range of uncertainty of the manufacturer value 11 from this black-body behaviour a maxwell-boltzmann distribution would be expect due to the continuous kinetic energy of tungsten molecule this distribution be not observe a the photodetector use in the interferometer be not very sensitive to wavelength outside of the visible spectrum however the rayleigh-jeans fit in figure 5 show that this behaviour be observe for wavelength in which the detector be sensitive thus far reinforce the black-body nature of the tungsten source furthermore the manufacturer state the wavelength range a 360nm -2600nm 11 which support the fact that the detector be not sensitive a the measure spectrum have a much narrower spectral width from figure 6 the tungsten with a yellow filter have a peak wavelength 582 ± 5 nm with a coherence length 15 ± 13 µm whereas in figure 7 the peak wavelength be 543 ± 5 nm and the coherence length be 7 ± 3 µm this be in agreement with the manufacturer value for the filter 12 the large uncertainty be due to the low signal strength in this range of wavelength from the tungsten source show that the tungsten source be largely compose of low frequency visible component or infrared component despite contain these spectrum the high uncertainty decrease the usefulness of a tungsten source when use a a light source for shorter visible wavelength to conclude a michelson interferometer be built to investigate the define characteristic of light source interferograms be take over the null point of the device for a white lead blue lead and a stabilize tungsten-halogen light source with vary filter a fast fourier transform be take to calculate the wavelength spectrum for each source and the peak wavelength full width half maximum and coherence length be determine from the spectrum it be possible to identify that a white lead be construct of an ingan blue lead with a phosphor coat which result in a broad spectrum over the visible wavelength furthermore the tungsten source be see to be a black-body radiator which behaves a a white light source with a large spectral width than a white lead despite identify the tungsten source a a blackbody radiator a more sensitive photodetector would be require to confirm that it wavelength distribution do result in a maxwell boltzmann distribution this would also give a well estimation for the temperature of the

66,2ndINT_VLS445_Redacted,this paper report on the outcome of an investigation into interferometry carry out use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer the aim of the investigation be to characterise different light source and describe their spectrum quantitively the source be discus in this paper be white and blue light-emitting diode lead and a white light tungsten source the tungsten source be use either with no filter or with a yellow or green filter interferograms of each source be take and they be fourier transform to produce spectral line the white lead have a spectral width of 3.41±0.01 ×10 13 hz and the blue lead have a spectral width of 3.81±0.09 ×10 15 hz the tungsten source with no filter have a spectral width of 3.91±0.03 ×10 13 hz and it temperature be also calculate to be 3620 ± 11.5 k. from this it be conclude that the tungsten source be a blackbody radiation emitter and that the white lead use be a blue lead with additional phosphor it be also conclude that the method of use this interferometer a a spectrometer be very accurate due to the close agreement of measure value with accepted value the michelson interferometer be first design in 1887 by albert a. michelson and edward w. morley in their famous experiment give the name the michelson-morley experiment the aim of their experiment be to detect the existence of an ether which be proposedly a medium that carry light wave after observe that there be no path difference between the light beam travel perpendicular through the ether and the beam travel parallel the ether theory have to be disregard this be why this experiment be often coin the most famous fail experiment a the result eventually lead to the formulation of special relativity by albert einstein the interferometer split a light beam into two part and each part be make to travel to two perpendicular mirror via different path length the two beam be brought back together at the detector where they interfere accord to their path length this be what allows interferograms to be drawn a the signal measure be record a a function of position the layout of the interferometer be show in the schematic diagram in figure 1. the light emit from the source be split into two by a partially silver mirror which act a a beam splitter the reflect beam a travel to mirror m1 and the transmit beam b travel to m2 the beam splitter have a dielectric plate on one side to ensure destructive interference occurs at exactly zero path difference this be so that a dark fringe be observe rather than a bright output and this allows for an easy location of the null point described later in the method at other path difference the type of interference be determine by whether the distance travel by the two beam differ by λ or by λ/2 if the path difference be an integer multiple of λ constructive interference will be detect and if it be an integer multiple of λ/2 destructive interference will be detect at intermediate path difference a superposition of the two beam determines the output at the detector move one of the mirror by a distance a small a the wavelength of light cause an observable change at the detector this be what make the michelson interferometer an extremely precise instrument for characterise the wavelength and spectral width of light source the mirror m2 can be tilt to change the cylindrical symmetry of the mirror this produce a different type of straight-line fringe call fizeau fringe whereas if m2 be left untitled circular haidinger fringe will appear figure 2 show the relationship between spectral line shape and their interferograms a result of fourier theory state that a gaussian spectral feature lead to a gaussian temporal feature the spectral feature have a gaussian shape due to the many wavelength be present and the impossibility of have a perfectly sharp spectral line this be because three main reason i quantum mechanical uncertainty in the energy of level with finite lifetime ii collisional broadening where collision reduce the effective lifetime of a state and iii doppler or thermal broadening where atom be move relative to the observer in addition to this there be an inverse relationship between the spectral width and the interferogram width this be due to the two graph be fourier transforms of each other the equation from which spectral width can be calculate be give in equation 1 below where ν be the spectral width l be the coherence length and c be the speed of light in a vacuum λ be the mean wavelength of the source and ∆λ be the spectral width convert from frequency to wavelength coherence length be a measure of the distance over which one arm of the interferometer can be scan before the interferogram contrast becomes poor therefore there be a few different way of calculate this for different source the method use in this report be by measure the full width at half maximum fwhm of the gaussian spectral feature and then use the follow relationship to calculate l a for the tungsten source it be a blackbody radiation emitter so it temperature could be calculate use equation 3. in addition to this the same spectral width calculation also apply except that the calculation become less accurate when a filter be use a there be multiple peak so the coherence length be more ambiguous t λ peak 2.898 × 10 −3 4 the interferometer be built a show in figure 1. the next step be to align the two light beam a strong green laser be use for this due to it high visibility than other source a lens be also add at the end of the beam splitter to far increase the ease of align the two light beam by eye once the two beam be align on top of each other mirror m2 be tilt to ensure hailinder fringe be be observe to allow for location of the null point find the null point be not a short process and there be many challenge that be overcome in find it firstly the green laser be use to narrow the range of where the null point would be found this be do by move the stage at a relatively high speed 0.005 and watch when the circular fringe converge in the opposite direction they state converge in this give a range of about 0.1mm then the laser be carefully swap with a white lead and the chosen range over which t would be scan be very specific now the 'take-data function use on linux take 3 argument i the position the stage will move to ii the speed at which it will do so and iii the number of sample after which the detector will stop take reading the challenge in find the null point include how fast the stage should move to ensure the null point be not miss this be solve simply by decrease the speed of the stage around the specify range the other challenge be the ambiguity at time of the range be determine by the green laser due to the fringe not visibly show whether they 're move inwards or outwards this be solve by increase the range scan whilst use the white light the main challenge face when take the real data for the lead and tungsten source be the sample frequency a the stage move too little sample cause the data to be less accurate because the fourier transform be perform on python will not be smooth enough due to large amount of data miss however if too many sample be take the stage would have to move very slowly and this cause an ambiguity in to where the stage think it at and therefore the position collect in the data this cause a lot of noise to be see on the fourier transform of the interferogram this challenge be solve by study the nyquist theorem and settle on a sample frequency in between both extreme after align the interferometer and find the null point the data be take for the three source be investigate in this report and below be the 5 'fast fourier transforms ffts for all of them this be what allows for the spectral width to be determine a it be from these graph that the coherence length be determine to a high level of accuracy this be then use in equation 1 and 2 to find out the spectral width the white lead do not agree with what be expect at first due to it have two peak however when the lead use in this experiment be research it be found that it be in fact a blue lead with add phosphor which add the red and green component to create the the ffts in figure 6 and 7 for the tungsten source with the two filter show more complicate shape this be because the filter only allow a specific wavelength through to the detector the yellow one clearly show a doublet also due to the way yellow light be compose of red and green peak the value for the spectral width for green and yellow filter on the tungsten source be 1.22±0.09 ×10 12 hz and 1.11±0.07 ×10 12 hz respectively in conclusion this experiment be carry out to a level where the spectral width of different light source be measure to a high enough accuracy the relationship govern the absorption of different type of radioactive particle be study the result suggest that the michelson interferometer can be use to a great extent of success a a spectrometer one area of this investigation which could be improve be the effect of background light on the interferograms while it would not have be possible to take reading in complete darkness this experiment could have be optimise by ensure that the background light be constant during reading and lamp be n't be constantly

59,2ndINT_WEM893_Redacted,abstract-when light be pas through a michelson interferometer light from the two arm interferes with each other due to a phase change along their respective path the resultant pattern be refer to a an interferogram in this lab report we investigate the interferograms for different source of light spectrum with different filter and use them to characterise the source and filter we investigate an unexpected result when apply the filter to a tungsten lamp certain wavelength be unexpectedly miss from the detect beam we explore factor such a dust in the lens alter which wavelength of light be be absorbed to explain this discrepancy t he michelson interferometer be invent in 1887 by albert michelson to determine the effect of the earth 's rotation on the speed of light 1 it be use in the famous michelson-morley experiment to search for the presence of the luminiferous aether through which light be believe to travel through when light from a source be pas through the interferometer it be split into two arm via a beam splitter light from these two arm be then reflect back onto the beam splitter when these beam be focus onto each other they produce an interference pattern call an interferogram it be expect that light travel in the direction of the earth 's rotation would travel faster than light travel perpendicular 2 which would show in the interferogram the result of the experiment be to disprove the existence of any such aether which would go on to be the basis of einstein 's second postulate of special relativity we have built a michelson interferometer to investigate several light source the aim of this report be to determine which wavelength be present in the spectrum of these source base on the interferograms produce and to investigate discrepancy between the interferograms produce and the expect result the beam splitter in an interferometer split incident light onto two arm a and b. light on arm a be reflect off the partially silver mirror while light on arm b be transmit light on path a and b be then reflect off mirror m1 and m2 respectively and be both detect at the detector a schematic of an interferometer be give in fig 1. the dielectric plate in the beam splitter cause a phase change in one arm of light therefore there be destructive interference incident at the detector when the path difference between the two arm be equal to mλ where m be an integer and λ be the wavelength of the light when an extend light source be use light appear to be both reflect and transmit at m2 fig 2. show the path difference between light come from arm a and b. this path difference be equal to 2tcos θ where t be the separation between m1 and m2 and θ be the angle between the incident ray and the normal to m1 a proof of this be give in appendix 1. therefore we get for destructive interference one light source may contain several different frequency of light the line width of the spectrum of light emit have an effect on the result interferogram consider a light source contain two frequency ω 1 and ω 2 where the amplitude be f t we can define such that therefore the amplitude of the wave at some time t can be described by the result pattern show fast oscillation with time period t f ast modulate by a slow frequency with time period t slow a demonstrate by fig 3. this beating pattern be dependent on the difference in frequency therefore the closer the two frequency the far the separation between the node of the beating pattern this can be extend to a source with a spectrum of frequency the narrower the spectral width the wider the beating pattern the amplitude of a beating pattern decrease with time a the phase difference of the interfere wave change this result in the interferogram look like a beating waveform envelop by a gaussian distribution from an interferogram one can determine property of the light source we will measure the peak wavelength present and the spectral width of each source we will take a fourier transform of each wave which will decompose the interferogram into the wavelength present the temporal coherence of a source refers to the average correlation between the interference pattern from one point in time to another and be related to the spectral width of the source 4 we define the coherence length l to be where c be the speed of light and τ be the coherence time the coherence time be equal to the change in time between the two point of the interference pattern ∆t therefore where ∆υ be the spectral width or the range of frequency combine equation 8 and 10 give we will take the coherence length of each source to be the full width half maximum fwhm of the gaussian envelope the equation for the fwhm be where σ be the standard deviation of the gaussian thus we can use the fwhm to find the spectral width by combine equation 11 and 12 an image of our interferometer be show in fig 4. we use a 100mm lens to focus light from a laser source onto the beam splitter to ensure the laser beam be parallel to the work surface we position a magnetic ruler at one end of the plastic tube that the laser be held in and measure it height at eye level we do the same for the other end of the tube and adjust the beam splitter to ensure these height be equal we then fix the stand hold m1 and m2 so that they be both perpendicular and equidistant from the beam splitter we rotate the beam splitter so that the beam be focus at the centre of m2 with a 25mm lens we focus the outgo beam onto a black card near the detector to make the beam clearer to see we then adjust m1 so that the two beam from arm a and b be focus at the same point result in circular haidinger fringe due to the cylindrical symmetry of the system we use a laser during the alignment process a it be more focus than the lead or tungsten source this allow u to achieve a precise alignment before we take data use other source the null point be the point at which t 0 m2 appear to be at m1 here wave from both arm of the interferometer be in phase result in a peak in amplitude we wish to take data close to the null point a this be where the beating pattern and overall gaussian be most clear to determine what range the null point be in we use equation 1 for a give fringe m be fix a we approach the null point t tends to zero therefore co θ must be increase so θ must be decrease therefore a m2 move toward the null point the haidinger fringe will appear to move inwards and vice versa this method allow u to narrow down the width of the range the null point be in to less than 1mm the nyquist sample theorem state that the sample frequency for a signal should be at least twice the high frequency contain in the signal to avoid aliasing 5 our simulation for the interference of white light show that the small wavelength present in the interferogram have an order of magnitude of 10 −6 m. we know that the detector by default sample at a frequency of 50hz we want the distance between sample to be 100 time small than the small wavelength present in the interferogram to achieve a good image base on this we set the motor speed to a maximum of 0.001mms −1 we take data for a white and a blue lead and a white light tungsten source with a green and a yellow filter we take data for the 1mm range we determine the null point to be in make sure that when we be take data that the work bench be not disturbed a the mirror be sensitive to vibration though the bench to minimise noise in the signal due to background light we conduct the experiment with the apparatus in a black box iv result and error analysis fig 5. show the characteristic of each light source the mean wavelength be calculate by zoom in on the peak wavelength present in the fourier transform in the case that there several wavelength peak the average of these peak be take when zoom in on the fourier transform to find the peak the plot appear to be uniform over a 20nm range therefore an error of 10nm be estimate for the measurement of the peak λ peak in the case that a light source give more than one peak the error be calculate use where n be the number of peak present fig 6. and fig 7. show the interferogram for the blue lead and it fourier transform respectively the third column of fig 5. refers to the standard deviation of the gaussian envelope fit to the interference pattern this fit be make use the curvefit function in the python module scipy.optimize data be selectively filter from the interferogram such that the gaussian be fit only the top curve a demonstrate by fig 8. the curvefit function return a matrix of the fit parameter include the standard deviation of the distribution a well a it associate error the coherence length be calculate from the standard deviation use equation 12 therefore the error on the fit parameter propagates to the error of the coherence length h therefore the spectral width be then calculate use equation 13 the result show that for the white light source the spectral width be significantly large than those of source that only emit one colour of light the theory justifies this a white light contains the entire spectrum of visible light so contains more frequency our result far corroborate the theory a the coherence length of the white light source be up to 100 time small than those for other source this demonstrates the reciprocal relationship between t slow and the range of frequency in a source demonstrate by equation 7 when analyse the effect of add a filter to the tungsten lamp we expect to see that the spectral width of the interferogram be narrower a we be select few frequency for the yellow and green filter we expect to see peak at 580 ± 10nm 6 and 543.5 ± 10nm 7 respectively a these be the quote bandpass range from the manufacturer while the result do fall in line with these prediction the fourier transforms show that there be several peak wavelength present instead of the expect one this be show in fig 11. and fig 12. when explore explanation for this result our initial guess be that the lens be scratch thus cause random error however the shape of the graph be similar to each other the likelihood of this happen a a result of scratch on the lens be small a they would have to both be scratch in the same way another theory be that the filter be perform a expect but the detector be less sensitive to certain wavelength thus cause the decrease in amplitude in the middle of the fourier transforms fig 11. be a plot of the relative sensitivity of the detector with increase wavelength of light provide by the manufacturer 8 we can see that the sensitivity of the detector increase with increase wavelength the effect of this would be to increase the amplitude of longer wavelength however this still do not explain the dip in our fourier transform our final theory be that there be some dust on the inside of the lens absorb certain wavelength a study publish in 2017 by atmospheric chemistry and physic test the mass absorption efficiency mae of different sample of mineral dust in 2 different category particle with with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10.6µm and particle with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5µm these group be denote p m 10.6 and p m 2.5 respectively 9 the mae be a measure of the rate of absorption of radiation it be found that regardless of the aerodynamic diameter of dust particle the mae decrease with increase wavelength fig 14. show that the mae for mineral dust be large for wavelength in the range 300nm to 600nm the dip in our fourier transforms for the green and yellow filter occur at around 540nm and 580nm respectively which fall into this range therefore if dust of similar physical property be present in the filter it be possible that it would cause the dip in our fourier transform the aerodynamic diameter of household dust particle range from 18µm to 95µm 10 which include the diameter of mineral dust test in the study these dust account for approximately 40 of emit aerosol mass per year on a global scale 9 therefore it be not unreasonable to hypothesize that some layer of dust be present in the filter thus cause the discrepancy in our result an interferometer be use to analyse 3 different light source a blue lead a white lead and a tungsten lamp the spectral width of these source be found to be 17.8ghz 63.2ghz and 61.3ghz respectively the light source with narrower spectral width have longer coherence length a expect when apply a green or yellow bandpass filter to the tungsten lamp the spectral width decrease to 2.7ghz and 2.5ghz respectively a fourier transform of the interferograms produce by use the filter show that certain wavelength be unexpectedly remove by the filter several factor could explain this such a the effect of a non uniform sensitivity from the detector and the effect of dust particle inside the filter the path difference between the two beam of light be equal to the length qrs minus the length qp the length x be therefore the length qrs be equal to the length z be where substitute equation 17 into equation 20 give the path difference d be therefore

12,2ndINT_VEJ488_Redacted,michelson interferometer have be use a a fourier transform spectrometer ft to measure partial atomic spectrum of tungsten and mercury and the spectrum of both white and blue light-emitting diode lead this method of interferometry be show to be useful a a mean of investigate the profile of such spectrum both qualitatively and in detail for precise measurement of for example spectral line and blackbody radiation interferometry have be a standard technique in experimental physic since the introduction of the method in the late 19th century initially gain fame for it application to the michelson-morley experiment 1 and recently in the experimental verification of the existence of gravitational wave by the ligo collaboration 2 interferometry have be use to investigate a wide variety of physical phenomenon this experiment applies these technique with a michelson interferometer to investigate the spectrum of various source electromagnetic radiation primarily within the visible part of the spectrum the underlie principle of the interferometer be in the interference property of light a coherent beam of light carry a phase at each point the evolution of which be determine by the wavelength or equivalently the frequency of the light beam if this beam be pas through a beam-splitter to form two beam and later recombine such that the two beam have traverse different distance then there will be a phase shift between them this phase shift cause interference of the two recombine beam which may be constructive or destructive and be dependent on the difference in path length of the two beam upon recombine measure sample of the intensity of the recombine beam for a sufficient range of difference in path length allows for the frequency profile of the initial beam to be determine use fourier analysis 4 this may be apply to initial beam of light from source with characteristic spectrum where the profile of such spectrum be to be determine this experiment u this method to measure the spectrum of a source with a tungsten filament the spectrum of a mercury lamp and the spectrum of both white and blue light-emitting diode lead the interferometer relies on the interference of light beam a a result of the difference between their phase consider an initial beam of light an electromagnetic wave e 1 with wavenumber k characterise by the monochromatic profile where x be the distance from the source time dependence be neglect without loss of generality let this beam be pas through a basic interferometer a in figure 1 the movable mirror extends the left arm of the interferometer by distance ∆x relative to the other arm such that the two arm be of equal length when ∆x 0. a will be use in the configuration of this experiment in section iii the beam splitter also cause a far phase change in one of the beam of π radian therefore the recombine beam e 2 at the detector will be of the form where the total path length difference between the two beam be 2∆x and the path length from the source to the detector of the light that be reflect off the fix mirror be give by d. therefore the intensity of the light a measure by the detector give by |e 2 2 will be the intensity of the initial beam be constant whereas the intensity of this measure signal varies sinusoidally have be pas through the the interferometer this be a result of the interference of the two recombine beam due to their acquire phase difference from their different path length for example in this monochromatic case the beam will alternate from interfere constructively to destructively a the path difference 2∆x change by integer multiple of π k this detect signal will be of zero intensity when the path length be the same ∆x 0 due to the phase shift of π radian at the beam splitter and a such this position where the length of the arm of the interferometer be the same be call the null point the other feature to notice be that the intensity of the measure signal a see a a function of ∆x have an effective wavenumber in ∆x of 2k twice the wavenumber in x of k of the initial beam in this way measure the intensity |e 2 2 over a sufficiently large range of ∆x allows for the wavenumber k of the initial beam to be determine that example for an idealise monochromatic source may be extend for source with more detailed frequency profile an initial beam with wavenumber density g k will be give by and in the same way a for equation 2 the recombine beam with a path length difference of 2∆x will be of the form in this case the intensity profile may be more detailed and the measure signal require fourier analysis in order to determine the original power spectrum |g k 2 the intensity data be sample discretely over a finite domain in ∆x rather than continuously over an infinite domain in these idealise example therefore analysis of the measure data require the use of a discrete fourier transform in order to best approximate the spectrum of the initial beam 5 a schematic of the configuration of the apparatus use in the experiment be give in figure 2. the core function of the interferometer come from the two mirror and the beam splitter light from the source be first pas through a ground glass diffuser and enters the beam splitter the beam splitter have a partially-silvered surface on one face and dielectric plate 6 on the other the beam incident on the beam splitter be partially transmit towards the fix mirror and partially reflect towards the mirror mount on a move stage the move stage may be control remotely and operates such that it may be give a position with a range of ±12mm to move to and a speed at which to move to it for the speed use in data collection for this experiment the motion of the stage be smooth to a good approximation the two split beam be reflect off the mirror and recombine at the beam splitter where the beam return from the movable mirror be partially transmit and the beam return from the fix mirror be partially reflect the beam return from the fix mirror gain an extra phase of pi radian in total upon recombine due to the dielectric plate 6 the recombine beam be then incident on an aperture on the surface of the detector face the beam splitter which digitally record the intensity of the beam at a rate of 50hz measure in arbitrary unit the component of the apparatus be mount on an optical bench and clamped this be do in order to minimise the effect on their alignment of adjust individual component and for example replace source or lens the apparatus be also contain in a close box mount on rubber stabilise support the support aim to minimise the effect of external vibration and disturbance from the lab on the apparatus a the alignment of the beam be otherwise very sensitive to disturbance the box be close so that minimal external light may enter the apparatus potentially contribute to background noise measure by the detector which may otherwise mask the signal of the beam or interfere with the beam itself similarly large dark shield be place around the beam splitter to ensure that the beam follow primarily the path a marked in red in figure 2 and do not impinge on area outside of this that may affect the signal at the detector the alignment of the apparatus be essential to the operation of the interferometer the process use here of align the apparatus be to first align the beam splitter with the move stage such that they be parallel this be do use a green test laser a the source with the beam splitter exit towards the fix mirror block off and a test surface in place of the detector to obtain a visual aid to the alignment subsequently the fix mirror be align by the same method the fix mirror be fit such that fine adjustment may be make to it orientation when fix in place the beam be allow to recombine again and with a 25mm plano-convex lens fit to the green test laser source in order to achieve a narrow beam for far alignment the orientation of the fix mirror be adjust until radial haidinger fringe 7 be observe and centre on the test surface the null point may be found with align apparatus at which the length of the two arm of the interferometer be equal this point be measure to have zero intensity the interference be destructive for all wavelength due to the phase change associate with the dielectric plat on one side of the beam splitter this be found use the white lead source with the 25mm plano-convex lens attach in order to narrow the beam a the point across which the detector measure the intensity to show oscillation over a small range of micrometer and to grow large this be do by observe interferograms take with the detector a the move stage translates the movable mirror towards or away from the detector at know position with the apparatus correctly align interferograms may be take with the detector of the intensity profile of the source around the null point from which discrete fourier analysis may be use to infer information about the spectrum of the source the interferogram around the null point for the unfiltered white lead source be give in figure 3. the intensity scale be in arbitrary unit and the distance variable be the displacement of the move stage from the centre of it axis the null point be not centre at a displacement of zero due to the distance of the unmoved stage from the beam splitter be slightly different to that of the fix mirror this do not affect the fourier decomposition of the power spectrum the slight asymmetry in this interferogram suggests that the apparatus be slightly misalign during data collection data set collect prior to this displayed even great asymmetry which be reduce through adjust the system alignment it be notice that there be also a slight vertical misalignment which may have cause this however due to the vertically fix nature of the component this could not be correct the spectrum of this data set may be calculate by discrete fourier transform in this case use the fourier tool built into mathematica a detailed in the documentation 8 and be show in figure 4. this spectrum show to peak a narrow peak of short wavelength centre around 436nm and a wider peak centre around 550nm with large spread this show that the white lead be not a perfect white spectrum over the visible range but be construct a a blue lead in a phosphor case the measure spectrum of the blue lead be show for comparison in figure 4 to highlight that this peak corresponds to blue wavelength the case absorbs some of the blue light the shorter wavelength peak and re-emits it over a wider spectral band with low energy the profile of this re-emitted light be similar to a black-body spectrum the interferogram of the blue lead be show in figure 5. the blue lead interferogram appear to be very symmetric about the null point and feature a gaussian envelope to a good approximation this be indicative that the profile of the peak around blue wavelength in the blue lead spectrum should also be gaussian this spectrum be show overlaid in figure 4. the interferogram around the null point for the unfiltered tungsten filament source be give in figure 5. the tungsten interferogram show a narrower pulse than for example the blue lead pulse the constituent wavelength also appear to be on average longer these suggest a broader spectrum centre around longer wavelength a show by the calculate spectrum in figure 7. this spectrum appear to cover a wide portion of the visible spectrum centre around the longer orange and red wavelength this suggests that the tungsten filament source emits light with a black-body spectrum a be recognisable in the data however for a black-body radiator the spectrum seem to drop off too rapidly at longer wavelength this be likely not due to the tungsten a the detector use be sensitive only to wavelength within a gaussian envelope over the visible part of the spectrum and so the contribution to the spectrum of the longer wavelength may not have be detect assume that this be a black-body spectrum then the peak a measure be at 772 ± 5nm which implies that the temperature of the tungsten filament be close to 3.8 × 10 3 k by wien 's displacement law this be past the melt point of tungsten and give the tungsten filament do not melt we conclude that the longer wavelength part of the tungsten spectrum be suppress by the limited wavelength range of the detector the interferogram of a mercury lamp be also measure a show in figure 8. the spectrum of this mercury intensity profile be give in figure 9. this spectrum feature many peak although it be difficult to conclude with any certainty if these be physical or a product of noise or random fluctuation in order to explore this spectrum with more detail the mercury source be place behind a yellow filter in order to obtain data for just a small yellow-centred portion of the spectrum the measure intensity profile with the yellow filter be give in figure 10. the yellow-filtered mercury interferogram show significant a significant beating effect envelop by a gaussian profile which be strongly indicative of a yellow doublet -two spectral line in the yellow part of the visible spectrum which be close together the fourier decomposition of this data be give in figure 11. whilst the interferogram appear to be well align and without much noise the spectrum found from it be difficult to interpret whilst there be peak visible none be clear enough to conclude to be peak of the mercury spectrum a each have very few data point at each this data set be reproduce in a second interferogram take of the yellowfiltered mercury source almost exactly suggest that there be little random behaviour a high resolution interferogram would be require to analyse this case far in order to resolve finer increment in the wavelength domain of the transform a great range of distance must be sample in the interferogram and at finer increment the profile of the yellow filter would also need to be know in order to ignore filter related effect in the spectrum this be beyond the limitation in time for this experiment interferometry be an invaluable technique in modern experimental physic this experiment use a michelson interferometer a a fourier transform spectrometer to take interferograms of light source by a tungsten filament a mercury lamp a white lead and a blue lead the discrete fourier transforms of these data set allow for region of these spectrum to be explore provide largely qualitative insight into their spectral profile this method may be extend far to perform measurement of these spectrum to high level of precision such a investigation of the mercury yellow doublet comparison have be make between the source and in the case of the white and blue lead their spectrum have provide information on the construction of the white lead this method have wide applicability and may be a powerful

9,2ndINT_GTD911_Redacted,we investigate different light source by the mean of a michelson interferometer the interferometer be set up from scratch use the part give and align use a laser the null point of the interferometer be determine use white light interference we record the interferograms of a white lead a blue lead a white light tungsten source and the tungsten with a yellow filter the interferograms be study and we perform fast fourier transform which decompose the interferograms into their spectral distribution they all signify that the relationship between the width of the interferogram and the spectral width of the wavelength that make up the light be reciprocal i n 2016 scientist successfully detect the first direct evidence of gravitational wave use the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ligo a show in figure 1. this work earn three researcher the 2017 nobel prize in physic in october 2017. an interferometer be a very powerful tool in experimental physic with application extend into other branch of science in our experiment we investigate the different light source by use a particular type of interferometer call the michelson interferometer the light source include white lead blue lead tungsten source and the tungsten source with a yellow filter our interest be in determine the spectral distribution of each source with the help of fast fourier transform routine in python fig 1 ligo experiment which also use the michelson interferometer to detect gravitational wave 1 ii theory in general there be number of type of optical instrument that form optical interference these instrument be classify under the generic name of interferometer the michelson interferometer be one of the simplest yet one of the most important of all interferometer 2 the layout of a michelson interferometer be show in figure 2 below the light emit from the source be split into two perpendicular beam by a beamsplitter which be a partially-silvered mirror the reflect beam a travel to a mirror m1 and the transmit beam b travel to another mirror m2 both ray be reflect at their respective mirror and they undergo a partial reflection and recombination at the beamsplitter upon return 2 fig 2 a diagram of the michelson interferometer setup 3 in order to understand how the interferometer produce intereference of light consider monochromatic plane wave of wavelength λ and uniform wavevector k emit from the source the recombine plane wave at the beamsplitter will interfere and the path difference of the two beam will determine the type of interference when the distance from the beamsplitter to m1 be exactly the same a the distance from the beamsplitter to the mirror m1 then the two beam will interfere constructively produce a bright plane wave output alternatively the two beam will interfere destructively if the path difference of the beam a and b be exactly λ/2 this lead to no light be incident on the detector hence move mirror a or mirror b by a fraction of λ make the difference between a bright fringe appear on the detector or a dark fringe appear there this make the michelson interferometer an extraordinarily precise ruler there will be a phase change for one of the beam due to the presence of dielectric plate on one side of the beamsplitter so the destructive intereference occurs at zero path difference result in a dark fringe instead of the expect bright fringe 3 it be important to think about what kind of fringe we be expect when look into a michelson interferometer the nature of the fringe depend mainly on the set up pf the instrument and how it be illuminate it be also possible that the two end mirror be not exactly at right angle to each other and we may send collimate light into it parallel ray come from infinity i.e plane wave or use an extend source we consider use an extend source and set the mirror at right angle to each other figure 2 show mirror m2 appear to be at position of m2 if the arm differ by length t the observer see the light originate from an extend source be reflect from two mirror separate by t a show in figure 3. let u see what happens when we choose to tilt slightly one of the mirror or to leave it 'correctly alligned the angle θ of the incoming ray will vary in both case beam of wavelength λ will interfere constructively for specific vale of θ. the cylindrical symmetry in the case in figure 4 suggests the fringe will appear circular and call haindinger fringe this be broken when one mirror be tilt so that so-called fizeau fringe form straight line c. use the interferometer a a spectrometer an optical spectrometer be an instrument use to separate and measure component of light which be call a spectrum 4 when a single monochromatic wave be sent into a michelson interferometer the output be just a series of bright and dark fringe which can be record electronically if the input light consists of two distinct frequency the sequence of bright and dark fringe interferogram be modulate and the separation between the null in the interferogram be related to the separation of the two frequency in frequency space over the course the wave rephase and the contrast be restore figure 5 provide clear view on why the relationship be reciprocal 3 let u imagine the interferometer be set up with exactly equal arm length the output be then monitor a the mirror be scan the actual output see be the sum of the two intensity distribution show the length of the fringe train show be such that a one move away from the zero path difference point the fringe form by the longer of the two wavelength be almost begin to 'catch up with the one form by shorter wavelength the overall fringe pattern be more or less the same a it be at zero point for light make up of two wavelength the mathematics of fourier transforms can be use to treat a source with arbitrary spectrum the basic idea of fourier transform be that it decomposes a function of time or space and represent it in frequency space show the constituent frequency that make it up 2 in our experiment a computer will be use to perform these complicate calculation it should also be note that the spectral line shape of a light source be approximately gaussian due to fall intensity of the source over the distance figure 6 show that a gaussian spectral feature lead to a gaussian spatial feature iii method before move on to build the michelson interferometer we developed a simulation of the interferometer and study what type of result we should expect among the variable we be manipulate be the speed at which the mirror move and hence how far the mirror move between the sample since the sample rate of the detector will be constant the number of sample could also be varied the skeleton program provide simulated the output that be expect from a light source with a gaussian profile and specify width the computer we use have the linux operating system therefore some time be use to familiarise ourselves the simulated output be deconstrusted use a fourier transform function built in the code call fast fourier transform fft in addition to that we also explore nyquist theorem on our simulation to get a well comprehension on how to obtain result with high resolution 3 for instance the affect of sample distance and the total distance move by the mirror on the reconstruct spectrum be investigate by vary them and observe the fft result the entire experiment involve the michelson interferometer be carry in a dark room to prevent external bright light source from disrupt the measurement hence it should be note there be a trip hazard one of the mirror be connect to a linear motor stage which be fix to the base the mirror be front surface and we try to avoid touch them or clean them after touch figure 7 show the set up of the interferometer firstly the beamsplitter be connect to a class 3r green laser and be position in front of the fix mirror stage 3 this be follow by the other adjustable mirror perpendicular to the beamsplittermirror stage line the laser be switch on and the reflection of the beam on the beamsplitter be observe we handle it cautiously so there be no stray beam it be ensure there be no 'double-points so both mirror be parallel to the beamsplitter to far align the interferometer the output of the interferometer be observe by place a white screen in front of the photodetector a show in the diagram the adjustable mirror be tilt in order to have the laser spot from the two arm directly on top of each other at the output the use of lens help observe the fringe more clearly specifically two lens -one to expand the laser beam into a broaden source and another to image laser onto the screen figure 8 show the fringe observe and the centre spot be chosen to be place on top of the opening of the detector so that it could detect the change in intensity more clearly now that interferometer be align the photodetector be connect to the pc the photodetector be a photodiode attach to an amplifier with variable gain and by default this sample the signal at a rate of 50hz to test if the photodetector a well a the software work the interferogram of the laser be take by move the mirror at a speed of 5 × 10 −4 mm −1 this be not really a solid test a the laser wavelength may drift however this be to familiarise ourselves to handle and analyse the data after obtain result we expect we move on to find the null point of the interferometer the null point be define a the point at which t =0 this be study use a white lead and observe it interference over the range of movement of the mirror white light be use a it contain a wide range of frequency therefore produce a narrow peak on the interferogram which be easy to notice the lens be remove for this source to be more efficient we measure the arm length use a ruler and narrow the range of the null point significantly we ran the motor at 3 × 10 −3 mm −1 with 5 × 10 4 sample the speed be chosen so that the detector can take at least 20 reading between the expect width of the peak in accordance with nyquist theorem for well resolution a 'spike be observe and it indicate the null point at which the intensity be the high the interferogram be zoom in digitally and the exact position of the null point be determine by move the cursor now the interferometer have be set up properly to start investigate the different light source the procedure be repeat for the white lead with a small range of distance around the null point for a high resolution interferogram the range use be between -4.54mm and -4.51mm with a speed of 1 × 10 −3 mm −1 the interferogram be save for far analysis by use the python code give we perform fft on the interferogram obtain and the offset involve with it be already rectify in the code the output associate with fft give the range of wavelength that make up the white light source with respect to it amplitude and be save the white lead be then replace with a blue lead and the result interferogram and the wavelength spectrum be study the same be carry out with a white light tungsten source and the tungsten source with a yellow filter the gain of the photodetector be varied depend on the intensity of the source from the inteferograms of each type of source the mean wavelength can be obtain when we observe two consecutive minimum on an interferogram the path difference ∆x between the two beam be a multiple of a half of the wavelength give by where n be a positive integer we measure the distance between two consecutive minimum by zoom into the interferogram and record their coordinate so n in this case be equal to 1. we assume the wavelength obtain from this be the mean wavelength of the source and that the sample distance be constant the coherence length l could also be obtain coherence length be the distance over which one arm of the michelson interferometer can be scan before the interferogram contrast becomes poor subsequently the spectral width ∆ υ which be give by where c be the speed of light be calculate 3 to turn this into wavelength we use where λ be the mean wavelength of the source 3 firstly we look at the output when the interferogram of the green laser be take a show in figure 9a the output be a expect series of area of low and high intensity in a sinusoidal pattern this corresponds to the destructive and constructive interference of the two beam at the photodetector the signal be not gaussian at first because the null point be not found yet a this be only to make u get use to the data handle next we consider the null point of the interferogram a show in figure 9b the spike occurs when the all the wavelength of the white light lead interfere constructively at the null point i b the 'spike signifies the null point a the wave interfere constructively fig 9 the range of distance be narrow down close to the null point and the interferogram obtain for white lead be show in figure 10a a surprising result come out when the fft be perform on the white lead interferogram show on figure 10b the shape of the spectrum be accurate since it be wide and continuous compare to the real spectrum of white lead in figure 10c there be a small peak on the left of the spectrum which signifies the blue wavelength associate within the colour white however the surprising element be the horizontal shift of the spectrum the wavelength at the peak have be shift to twice the actual value originally in the python code for the fft we double the sample distance to take the path difference due to the mirror 's movement into account and the spectrum look normal when we remove the double procedure this be weird a this give accurate result for the other source nonetheless we highly suspect the problem be within the code and the shape of the spectrum be still satisfy fig 10 on the other hand the blue lead produce a much broader interferogram than the white lead a indicate by figure 11a not surprisingly this look more similar to the simulation in figure 10d a the range of frequency in the blue lead be very narrow the fft of the interferogram in figure 11b reveal that the spectrum be very narrow with the peak wavelength around 480nm compare to the real spectrum in figure 11c the result for the blue lead be a expect and also verifies the reciprocal relationship between the range of wavelength and width of the interferogram the blue lead be now replace with a white tungsten source the interferogram obtain be show in figure 12a the output look very similar to the white lead a both source consist of wide range of wavelength thus produce narrow interferograms after the fft procedure show in figure 12b the wavelength spectrum seem to be broad and continuous just like the white lead a closer inspection reveals that most of the spectrum lie on the infrared region and indicates that most of the energy be dissipate a heat rather than visible light similar to the real spectrum in figure 12e the tungsten source be then connect to a yellow filter figure 12c show the interferogram obtain and be similar to the blue lead 's one a expect the fft see figure 12d indicates a very narrow spectrum centre around a wavelength of 600nm which be the wavelength that corresponds to the colour yellow the noise around the peak could be related to the very low intensity of the source couple with the large gain of the photodetector to improve this a brighter tungsten source should be use it be also interest to notice that in figure 12c there be small peak on the side of the middle peak and this be not in the case of blue lead it just could be noise from the aforementioned issue or an effect due to the very narrow spectrum of wavelength more experiment must be do before any real conclusion can be make now the interferograms of each type of source mention above be study to investigate a few feature without need to perform the fft method from the code the result be summarise in table i. the mean wavelength λ be calculate by use equation 1. subsequently equation 2 and 3 be use to calculate the spectral width in both ∆υ and ∆λ form the mean wavelength of all the source be similar to the result from fft except for the white lead this suggests the issue be with the code a mention before also overall the value of ∆λ be significantly small than what we observe in fft this be probably due to the approximation and assumption involve in the equation yet they all show similar trend broad interferograms have small ∆λ in the case of blue lead and the tungsten source with yellow filter we could also predict the temperature t in kelvin of the tungsten filament from the mean wavelength obtain use wien 's displacement law which be give by the equation below 3 t λ 2.898 × 10 −3 therefore we obtain a temperature of 3500 − 400 k which show the tungsten use follow a similar distribution a the red curve in figure 12e we investigate different light source by the mean of a michelson interferometer the interferometer be set up from the scratch use the part give and align use a laser the null point of the interferometer be determine use white light interference we record the interferograms of a white lead a blue lead a white light tungsten source and the tungsten with a yellow filter the interferograms be study and we perform fast fourier transform which decompose the interferograms into their spectral distribution they all signify that a broad spectrum of wavelength of light will produce broad interferograms overall this be not an easy experiment to carry out a the highly sensitive instrument be prone to even a small error we encounter a few problem during the experiment such a when we be take the measurement to find the null point the instrument kept give weird result and it take a considerable amount of time to figure it out apart from that the code and the software provide have a few issue for example the software have a limit for the number of sample it could record this might make u miss important point during the measurement since the motor be move even though the detector stop record to improve the more sophisticated method of handle data should be use besides more variety of source with different spectrum should be investigate to far study the reciprocal

60,2ndINT_WSY182_Redacted,an investigation be undertaken with the aim of demonstrate the use of a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer to analyse the composition of light use fourier analysis a variety of light source be analyse and compare white lead tungsten white light with and without filter and blue lead the observation make agree well with the prediction from optic theory and the method be show to be accurate and precise interferometry be a technique in which wave be superpose and the result interference be analyse to make physical deduction spectrometry be a technique use to separate and measure the spectral component of a physical phenomenon usually light interferometry and spectrometry be both essential component of every physicist toolbox and they be use every day in a wide range of experiment in this investigation a simple michelson interferometer and a computer with analysis software be use in conjuction a a spectrometer to analyse the spectral component of a variety of light source white lead blue lead and filtered/unfiltered tungsten light the principle of superposition of light state that when two or more em wave interact the result wave function be equal to the sum of the individual wave 2 this can lead to interference between the two wave and this interference depends on phase difference between the two wave if in phase then constructive interference occurs and the result amplitude be a maximum conversely in anti-phase destructive interference occurs and the amplitude of the result wave be a minimum hence when two wave superpose they form interference pattern with series of bright and dark band call interference fringe these interference fringe encode information about the light source and hence can be use to deduce physical property of the system in a michelson interferometer one light source be split into two perpendicular beam vary the length of these beam varies the difference in path length between the two beam when they be recombine it be therefore possible to manipulate the interference pattern by vary the length of one of the interferometer arm then measure how interference change with vary path length allows the use of fourier analysis to determine the frequency of light present the set up use in this experiment consists of a basic michelson interferometer a light source be direct towards a beam splitter which split the source into two perpendicular beam path a path b. the two beam then travel out from the beam splitter and be reflect by mirror which be held perpendicular to the beam such that they be reflect directly backwards the two path be then recombine and produce an interference pattern which be measure by the detector a show in figure 1. it be important to ensure that both mirror be perpendicular to the light beam so that the interference observe consist of circular heidinger fringe like that on the cover of this report 1 to do this a green laser source be use and each mirror be alligned independently follow by allignment of the combine beam an image of the alligned apparatus can be see in figure 2. the detector measure intensity of light receive at a sample frequency of 50hz by move mirror a use the stage the length of path a be change relative to path b. this result in a change of the interference pattern and hence a change in the measure intensity the null point be a term use to describe the configuration of the equipment in which path a and path b be of equal length this be important a the interest interference effect happen about the null point and the effect decrease a we move away from the null point to take data mirror a be move very slowly about the null point whilst mirror b remains fix the position of mirror a and the intensity of light be both record once every 0.02s this data can then be plot into an interferogram to show the observe fringe the interferogram can then be fourier transform from position space to frequency space to reveal the frequency of light present in the original source this part be essential and be what completes a spectrometer rather than just an interferometer through early observation it be found that very short distance between measurement result in noisy data this be due to the imprecision of the move stage over distance on the nanometer scale the stage would slip at these scale and hence data would contain a lot of noise the detector have a fix sample rate of 50hz and hence to account for this measurement need to be take at high speed a minimum speed of 0.001mm/s be decide on for proceed measurement correspond to a minimum distance between sample of 20nm this be found to be a good balance between detail and speed such a to maximise the smoothness of the measure interferograms whilst retain a much detail a possible before compare different light source use this set up it be important to first find the null point this be first do with a green laser light source a quick check for the direction of fringe movement at different position allow the location of the null point to be measure between −5.9mm and −5.98mm since either side of the null point the fringe would move in opposite direction to locate the null point more precisely a light source with a small coherence length be need a this result in a very narrow interferogram the green laser be replace by a white lead which should have a wide spectrum and hence a narrow interferogram data be take between −5.9mm and −5.98mm and the measure interferogram can be see in figure 3. to measure the null point a accurately a possible a gaussian envelope be fit to the absolute intensity profile of the white lead the signal level from the normalise interferogram be square and root to give a positive 'spike this can be see in figure 4. the gaussian fit be not perfect and a superposition of gaussians or an approximation to a dirac delta function might be more appropriate to fit the data however for the purpose of this investigation the precision of the gaussian fit be adequate the null point be found to be at a position of x −5.8964 ± 0.0005mm measurement that follow be all take through a narrow band of position around this null point to save time the interferogram of the white lead be discus in the previous section in order to convert this into a spectrum of wavelength a fast fourier transform fft be take and the wavelength profile be plot on the nanometer scale the measure spectrum can be see in figure 5 a expect the white lead produce a wide band of wavelength from around 400nm to 800nm cover the entire visible spectrum and reach into the infrared region a gaussian fit of the spectrum give a mean wavelength of λ 602 ± 66nm this high error of 11 be likely due to the misuse of the gaussian approximation of the data a can be see in figure 5 there be in fact two measure peak one at 460nm and one at 600nm the leftmost peak be likely due to background light from an external light source a the light block lid be not fit during the take of this data some superposition of gaussians be likely more appropriate however for the purpose of comparison in this investigation the gaussian approximation be enough give an idea of the width and intensity of the emission spectrum the next source to be analyse be white light from a thorlabs sls201l tungsten light source a with the white lead in the previous section a narrow wavepacket be expect due to the broad emission profile of the tungsten source a total of 1200 measurement be take about the nullpoint between −5.908mm and −5.884mm the measure interferogram can be see in figure 6. a before an fft be take to convert the interferogram into a measure spectrum the measure spectrum can be see in figure 7. a gaussian approximation yield a mean wavelength of λ 870±130nm this be wider than the white lead profile and also center on a much high wavelength outside of the visible spectrum upon inspection of the datasheet for the tungsten source 3 it be clear that there be some limitation introduce by the detector the emission profile for the tungsten source should reach all the way into high wavelength of 2600nm but the measure profile only reach up to around 1200nm figure 8 show the measure spectrum plot alongside the expect emission spectrum give by thorlabs the detector use consist of a very small aperture hence high wavelength of light particularly those beyond 1200nm could not be detect the measure spectrum be only a partial one and a detector with a large aperture would be require to measure high wavelength and reconstruct the full spectrum nevertheless the detector do pick up on visible wavelength between 400nm and 700nm and hence the tungsten source be suitable in order to test the effect of visible light filter a thorlabs fl543.5-10 green filter be fit to the tungsten light source such that light would pa through the filter before enter the interferometer the purpose of a filter be to absorb most wavelength of light and transmit only a narrow band of light in the green region of the visible spectrum hence the measure spectrum should consist of a tight band of green wavelength a before measurement be take about the null point a total of 3600 sample between −5.93mm and −5.858nm be take with the stage move at a speed of 20nm/s the measure interferogram can be see in figure 9 compare to both the white lead and the tungsten source the interferogram of the green light be very broad with first order interference fringe span from −0.015mm to 0.015mm relative to the null point this be over 7 time wider than the interferograms of the white lead and the tungsten source both of which span from −0.002mm to 0.002mm relative to the null point a fourier transform of the wide interferogram should result in a very narrow band of wavelength be present in the measure spectrum which be exactly what be expect for an optical filter figure 10 show the measure spectrum of tungsten light through the green filter accord to the data sheet the wavelength transmit by the green filter 4 be 543.5 ± 2nm the gaussian approximation give a mean wavelength of λ 540 ± 30nm this show u that the spectrometer be very accurate differ from the expect value by only 0.65 the spectrometer be also precise with an uncertainty on this measurement of just 5.6 the green filter be then replace by a thorlabs fb580-10 yellow filter a before a very narrow band of wavelength be expect in the yellow region of the visible spectrum a total of 3600 measurement be take between −5.93mm and −5.858mm and the firstorder interference band can be see in figure 11. the width of the yellow interferogram be roughly the same a that of the green filter this be a expect give that both filter be make by the same manufacturer an fft be take a before and the result spectrum can be see in figure 12. the mean wavelength through gaussian approximation be found to be λ 576 ± 37nm accord to the datasheet 5 the yellow filter should transmit wavelength of λ 580 ± 2nm which once again show that the spectrometry method be use be both precise and accurate compare the yellow spectrum against the green spectrum in figure 10 it can be see that whilst the width be similar the intensity of yellow light measure be much great than that of green light this make sense refer back to figure 7 reveals that the yellow light center at 570nm be closer to the center of the tungsten emission profile and hence should have great intensity for completeness a truopto osub5111p blue lead be fit in the interferometer and it light be analyse and compare to the filter figure 13 show the measure interferogram a one would expect the observe interferogram be wider than both the white lead and the tungsten source however it be actually narrower than both the green and yellow filter light a narrower interferogram corresponds to a wider wavelength band suggest that filter may be a well route at generate monochromatic light than lead 's it could also just mean that the precision standard follow by truopto for their lead 's be less than the standard held by thorlabs for their filter figure 14 show the measure spectrum of the blue lead the mean wavelength be estimate to be λ 467 ± 17nm once again this be accurate and precise compare to the expect wavelength of 470±5nm give in the lead 's datasheet 6 this be actually the best fit of all the light source discus with a tiny percentage uncertainty of just 1.1 suggest that although the lead produce a wider band of wavelength it have less irregularity and imperfection than the filter the maximum amplitude of the receive blue lead signal be ∼ 280 000 figure 13 whilst the max amplitude of the green and yellow light be just ∼ 595 figure 9 and ∼ 650 figure 11 respectively a brighter light source mean that fluctuation introduce by the detector be less significant than for the dim light source and hence the precision of the spectrometer be increase lead 's may therefore still be the well option for generate monochromatic light the large source of error in this experiment be the error introduce by the move stage a discus in section 4.1 the stage would slip and introduce noise in position measurement this effect be greatly reduce by increase the distance between measurement however the error be not remove entirely the fft require the assumption that data point be evenly space in position space and due to the slip of the stage this be not entirely valid to reduce the error far it may be sensible to write error correction code which group data point into evenly space 'bins provide a reasonable amount of data point remain this would decrease the noise in the fft and hence high precision spectrum could be obtain a far source of error in the experiment be cause by slight misalignment of the apparatus a can be see in both figure 3 and figure 6 there be a negative skew in the the measure data due to misalignement of the two light beam which inevitably cause an asymmetry in the final spectrum it may be sensible to conduct this experiment on a large optical bench increase the length of the interferometer arm would enhance the effect of misalignment which may not be obvious on a small set of apparatus those misalignment would then be fix before any data be take a far improvement could be make by increase the aperture of the detector use a wider aperture would mean that high wavelength photon could be detect deeper into the infrared region of the spectrum a discus in section 4.4 this would allow more comprehensive emission spectrum to be obtain a wider aperture also mean that a great total number of photon would be detect and hence the brightness of the receive signal would be great a discus in section 4.7 this would reduce the error on signal measurement and hence the uncertainty on the measure spectrum even far to summarise this investigation demonstrate a michelson interferometer pair with a computer and data analysis software a a spectrometer this spectrometer be use to analyse and compare a variety of different light source and the observation match well with prediction the method outline be clearly powerful with result that be both accurate and precise nevertheless it have it downside and small adjustment could be make to far improve the quality of the experiment,deep,exp,70,0.712151408,0.287848562
18,2ndINT_JUA192_Redacted,the wavelength of four different light source a white lead a blue lead and tungsten with a yellow and green filter have be determine use a michelson intel'fe1•omete1• act a a fourier transform spectromete1• an interferogram centre at the null point for each source be found and fourier transform to give the wavelength spectrum the spread of wavelength have also be found and compare to the expect range of wavelength for all the source there be a large overlap between the calculate range of wavelength and the expect range of wavelength in most case the calculate upper and low bound be within 1 t of the true value the michelson interferometer be developed by albeit a michelson in 1881 to detect the flow of the ether -the postulate medium for the propagation of light 1 1. the improve experiment in 1887 the michelson -morley experiment be now widely know a the most famous 'failed experiment in the field of physic after disprove the existence of the ether in 1887 michelson and morley discover fine structure splitting of some of the balmer line this be possible due to the high precision of the assemble apparatus which be previously require to theoretically detect the now disprove ether the precision of the apparatus be what allows for the characterisation of the spectmm of various light sow•ces characterise the spectrum of various light source be cmcial to gain insight into the composition of various object include star to find the elemental composition of an object use it spectmm you must first know the spectmm of the suspect element to a high degree of accuracy in this experiment the michelson interferometer have be alter to be use a a fourier transform spectrometer in order to find the spectrum of various light source in this investigation the michelson interferometer have be use a a fourier transfo1m spectrometer -only one miitor be fix while the other be allow to move two type of fringe can be see use the setup -haidinger fringe and fizeau fringe the setup in fig 1 would result in visible haidinger fringe at the detector due to the mu1'0rs be in a perpendicular alignment if one mu1'0r be to be tilt slightly fizeau fringe be visible the separation between the null point and the translate mirror position have be label t. ml represent the position of the move mirror while m2 represent the position of the fix mirror when ml be at m2 it be the same distance from the beam splitter a m2 adapt from 2 the order of visible haidinger fringe can be show to be where t be the be the separation between the move mirror and the null point the point where the two mi11'0rs be equidistant from the beam splitter 0 be the angle between an incoming light ray and the view axis see fig 2 m be the order of interference and .. l be the wavelength of the light note that in this experiment multiple wavelength will be present in the light source characterise the visible haidinger fringe be thus circular and concentric for a constant 𝑡 𝑚 and 𝜆 the angle 𝜃 be constant movement of m1 will allow for an interferogram to be found which plot the amplitude a a function of distance from the null point this allows for the spectrum of the source to be produce by perform a fourier transform on the interferogram in this investigation a fast fourier transform fft algorithm have be use from the scipy library in python the fourier transform give a plot with the oscillation per step on the x axis i.e the wavenumber 𝜈 ̃ from the nature of fourier transforms it can be show that a wider fringe on an interferogram lead to a narrower gaussian spectral line this plot can then be manipulate to give the wavelength spectrum since to find the range of wavelength δ𝜆 the spectral width δ𝜈 must first be found where 𝑐 be the speed of light and l be the coherence lengththe propagation distance over which the coherence significantly decrease this can be found by fitting the record interferograms with a gaussian curve where 𝜎 of the gaussian represent l. the range of wavelength δ𝜆 be then where 𝜆 be the mean wavelength found from take the fft of the interferogram and manipulate it use 2 this allows for 𝜆 to be quote with a give spread for each light source investigate alternatively δ𝜆 can be measure from the fwhm full width at half maximum of the wavelength spectrum the apparatus be assemble so that it resemble fig 1. each object be attach to the base use a clamp which be then screw into place this ensure that there be no movement of any part of the setupa small change in position can completely misalign the apparatus to correctly align the mirror and source with the beam splitter a green laser be use in conjunction with a converge lens a screen be place in the position of the detector allow for the mirror to be adjust so that beam a and b see fig 1 be both perfectly overlap this require tilt the fix mirror and then align it correctly in the plane by adjust the beam position along the vertical and horizontal ax partial reflection at the beam splitter boundary be also account for so that the reflect beam also overlap perfectly with the beam a and b. the screen be also displace towards and away from the beam splitter to ensure that the beam be truly overlap rather than converge at a point on the screen once the apparatus be align the null point be found the green laser now show the follow haidinger fringe on the screen a large amount of fringe be visible use 1 it can be see that for a fix 𝑚 𝑡 increase a 𝜃 decrease suggest that more fringe be visible a m1 get far from the null point m1 be mount on a motor that allow for movement of fraction of a wavelength to be make the null point range be first found visually by move the mirror and find the mirror position where the least amount of fringe be visible see fig 4 the null point be found to be within a 0.30 mm interval 2.57 -2.60 mm within this interval the follow image be visible once this region be identify the lens be remove and a white lead replace the green laser the detector be swap for the screen and the interferogram within the mention region be found the apparatus be cover to minimise the effect of background light with the 𝐿 1 and 𝐿 2 represent the virtual image at m1 and m2 ′ respectively it can be see that the path difference between the incoming ray from 𝑃′ and 𝑃′′ will be 2𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝜃 adapt from 3 detector connect to a computer via usb the linux terminal be use to adjust the start point a well a the movement speed of m1 and the amount of reading to be take this data be then plottedthe central peak position be the position of the null point the speed be set to 0.001 mm -1 with over 1600 data point be take between 2.57 mm and 2.60 mm the interferogram be a follow from fig 5 the null point can be found it be found to be 2.5916 ± 0.0001 mm note that in practice the distance between measurement make by the detector be not constant but have be assume to be constant for the purpose of this investigation to characterise light source interferograms be plot for each source a gaussian curve be fit to each interferogram use a least square curve fit from the scipy library in python the parameter for 𝜎 be then equivalent to value of l in 3 allow for the use of 4 to find δ𝜆 the value of 𝜆 use be obtain by use a fft algorithm see section ii on the interferogram to find a spectrum resemble a gaussian centre at the wavelength from which 𝜆 can be easily extract from this spectrum δ𝜆 can be calculate by measure the fwhm thus give two separate method to estimate δ𝜆 to increase precision four source be investigate a white lead a blue lead and a white tungsten source with two separate filter green and blue for each source a plot of the interferogram with the fit gaussian curve have be produce a well a a plot show the wavelength spectrum produce use a fft see section ii on the interferogram for the white lead the follow fit be make the standard deviation be found to be 4.22 ± 0.08 × 10 -7 m. the error have be obtain from the covariance matrix of the curve fit use for the gaussian curve this lead to a value of 1.13 ± 0.02 × 10 14 hz for δ𝜈 to give context to this value the wavelength spectrum must be consider compare fig 6 to fig 7 it can be see that the narrow interferogram give a wider spectrum a expect for white light the range of wavelength within the white light source can be estimate by take the fwhm of the spectrum which give a range between 504 ± 2 nm and 677±2 nmthis cover a large range of the visible spectrum which be generally quote a lie between 380 nm and 740 nm 4 the error of the fwhm measurement come from measurement error use the python figure the value of δ𝜆 calculate use this method be therefore 173 ± 3 nm use the mean wavelength a 𝜆 4 can be use to find δ𝜆 this give a value of 137 ± 2 nm for δ𝜆 which clearly differs from the value obtain from the previous method the mean wavelength be estimate to be 602 ± 20 nmthis be obtain by judging the centre point of the apparent gaussian that would fit the spectrum in fig 7. the error in the lack of precision of this method have be account for in the quote value take an average of the two method the white lead emits wavelength in a range of 504 -677 nm with a mean 𝜆 of 602 ± 20 nm and a δ𝜆 of 155 ± 4 nm the range found be encompass in the expect rangethe discrepancy be likely due to the white lead spectrum since there be no distinct peak for white light try to compare the error between 𝜆 ± ∆𝜆 2 and the true upper and low bound for the range be pointless for the blue lead see fig 8 for the interferogram produce 𝜎 be found to be 1.18 ± 0.03 × 10 -6 m give δ𝜈 a 4.0 ± 0.1 × 10 13 hz the spectral width be an order of magnitude small than the white lead which can be expect since the blue lead should contain a much narrower range of frequency the wavelength be found use fig 9. the mean wavelength of the blue lead be see much easy since only a single symmetric peak be visible find δ𝜆 use the fwhm give a value of 32 ± 3 nm with a range of 447 ± 2 nm 479 ± 2 nm use 4 with a value of 463 ± 1 nm a 𝜆 δ𝜆 be found to be 29 ± 1 nmit can be see that both value be very similar with an overlap error range this be likely due to the increase 7 the wavelength spectrum of the white lead the dip in intensity at ~500 nm be worth note since this be a common feature for various type of white lead 5 l ... accuracy of the estimate for 𝜆 from fig 9 since the spectrum be symmetric this give an average of 31 ± 3 nm for δ𝜆 the accepted range for blue light be 450 nm -490 nm 6 which mean the range of wavelength and mean wavelength have be calculate accurately the only inaccuracy be the upper bound wavelength 𝜆 δ𝜆 2 479 ± 3 nm not 490 nm a expect this be likely due to the spectrum of the blue lead not exactly reproduce the entirety of the visible blue range to confirm this a gaussian must be fit to fig 9 to more accurately estimate δ𝜆 and comparison must be drawn with the manufacturer 's specification for the lead the range of the expect range of wavelength be within 3 𝜎 of the upper range of the calculate upper bound for the range and within 1 𝜎 of the low boundthe result found be fairly accurate for the plot for the tungsten source with the green and yellow filter see the appendix for the green filter 𝜆 be 534 ± 3 nm with a δ𝜆 value of 34 ± 2 nm the true green range be 520 -560 nm the calculate low range lie within 1 𝜎 while the upper range lie within 2.5 𝜎 of the true value for the yellow filter 𝜆 be 571 ± 4 nm with a δ𝜆 value of 33 ± 2 nm the true yellow range be 560 -590 nm both the calculate upper and low range lie within 1 𝜎 of the true value it be also worth note the existence of two peak for both filter which be not expect the filter should theoretically allow a single wavelength through with a gaussian spread resemble the spectrum in fig 9. the reason for this be unknown also note for all the source use the space between measurement be not constant due to restraint in the motor connect to m1 a well a the software use to obtain the wavelength spectrum via a fft the sample space must be presume to be constant the value use for each plot be 41 nm with each source have a different amount of sample take v. conclusion four different light source have be investigate use a michelson interferometer act a a fourier transform spectrometer the null point point where the two mirror be equidistant from the beam splitter be found for each light source data be record near the null point to plot an interferogram for each source the interferograms be then fourier transform to find the wavelength and spread of wavelength for each source the spread of wavelength be found use two method the first method involve measure the fwhm of the wavelength spectrum while the second use a gaussian fit on each interferogram to find the spectral width allow for the wavelength spectrum to be calculate for every wavelength calculate the range of wavelength overlap with the theoretical range with a small error to increase accuracy the experiment can be perform in an environment that reduces any vibration since the mirror m1 be move at fraction of a wavelength this may be the reason why the spectrum for tungsten produce two peak rather than one far investigation must be do to increase precision and reduce the effect of background light and vibration lt-7,superficial,bal,50,0.722497582,0.277502418
42,2ndINT_BPP712_Redacted,michelson interferometer be use to investigate the transmission nature of thin-film bandpass-filters for this a green and a yellow filter be testis with a tungsten lamp both of them show several maximum in their transmissivity which verify the creation of a fabry-perot cavity in the filter additionally it be found that the maximum create by the green filter be space by integer multiple of 6.6 ± 0.7 nm i n 1899 the french physicist charles fabry and alfred perot developed an interferometer base on a transparent plate with two reflect surface 1 today the design be vastly use for optical fiber communication to separate multiple layer of the transmit signal it be also use for thin-film filter to create more exact reflective and pa band than absorption filter hence a michelson interferometer be use to determine the structure of two bandpass-filters interferograms for a tungsten lamp with and without the filter be create and compare to each other the detector be base on a silicone photo diode thus it measure light intensity with the photoelectric effect so that light energy have to excite electron in the diode for electromagnetic wave the magnetic and the electric part contribute equally to the energy carry by the wave ψ. thus it be enough to inspect only the electric field e to determine the intensity of the light for any electric wave the intensity be proportional to the square of the electric field strength 2 thus due to the geometry of the interferometer it may be approximate that the light propagates only in one direction x. thus ray emit from the light source can be assume to follow the equation where a be the amplitude k be the wavevector ω be angular frequency and φ be the phase shift at the beam splitter this be divide into two ray so that each be direct at one of the two mirror and thus reflect hence one of them have to travel far by twice the mirror separation distance at the beam splitter they be combine again and interfere with each other so that a new wave be create where for the first wave φ be set to be 0 and for the second it corresponds to the shift acquire when travel the additional distance 2d combine this with equation 1 condition for constructive and destructive interference can be found constructive interference occurs when n 0 2 4 ... and destructive when n 1 3 5 ... this can be then extend for an input of mixed wavelength so that for a give d a different interference can be measure with the detector a show in appendix a this lead to a physical fourier transform fig 1. crosssection of a thin-film bandpass filter 3 not to scale and the number of layer may vary the incident light ray be trap between the partially transmissive dielectric layer and thus a fabry-pierot cavity be create a a result destructive and constructive interference occurs so that wavelength far away form the central wavelength be not transmit to decrease the passband of the filter the substrate layer be cover in absorptive material with a broad block range thus the result shape may be described a periodic spike in a gaussian envelope at first a computer simulation be use to model the interferometer distinct light spectrum be model a gaussian distribution and layer onto each other this show that a large spike in light intensity be always to be see at the point where both interferometer arm have the same length null point d 0 the spectral range of the input be varied and it be found that a large spectral width lead to a narrower spike this corresponds to the principle of a fourier transform thus the null point could be most accurately found by inspect a white light source due to it broad spectrum base on this a michelson interferometer be built fig 1 the light source be place in a long tube to minimise light pollution and point at the beam splitter from there it be direct partially to the movable and partially to the stationary mirror 50 each thus a phase difference between the ray be induced since the distance travel by the ray would not be equal unless d 0 be reflect by the mirror the beam be again connect by the beam splitter the combine ray would then be measure by a detector with adjustable gain for white light source lead tungsten lamp a diffuser be place between the source and the beam splitter in order to achieve more uniform illumination to increase light intensity for weaker signal tungsten with filter a convex lens f 100 mm be place between the beam splitter and the detector the detector be position in the focal point the filter be place in the same area however they be mount onto a separate stand a see in fig 2 for easy implementation additionally the setup be place on rubber leg to minimise the effect of mechanical shock from the environment this be however not sufficient a external shock could be clearly record hence every measurement be take multiple time and inspect for random error firstly a laser be use to align the mirror the non movable mirror be adjust so that the two reflect ray would meet in one point at the detector then the interference pattern be inspect for haidinger fringe a they be form when the two ray be parallel 1 for large displacement the haidinger fringe would turn into fizeau fringe thus it be establish that the alignment of the movable mirror change with d. to minimise this effect on data quality a narrow range around the null point be inspect ±0.1 mm from null point moreover it be discover that if the mirror be move slow than 0.0003 mm s the distance between measurement be strongly distort by random error hence for all measurement the optimum velocity be establish to be 0.001 mm s a determine in the simulation a white lead be use to 4 therefore the null point should be marked by the global maximum of the obtain graph however the result graph for the lead be asymmetric this may be attribute to the lead 's not fully uniform light emission thus the null point be take to be the large visible spike and the related uncertainty be measure to be the distance to the next maximum from repeat measurement it be found that the movable mirror have to be place −1.7829 ± 0.00024 mm away from the center of the stage to be at the null point the obtain interferograms be then base on d with a discrete fourier transform a conversion to the wavelength domain be possible however for this the step size of the movable mirror be necessary fig 5 the motor be measure it position relative to the stage step size for 10000 measurement in a range of 0.2 mm at 0.001 mm s during each measurement of intensity by the detector the adjacent position value be then take and subtract from each other so that the step size between measurement be calculate this be then plot in a histogram and the result shape be approximately a cutoff gaussian with it peak at −20 nm and a standard deviation of 4.26 nm thus the step be assume to be approximately −20 nm so that a uniform discrete fourier transform could be apply this assumption be confirm with interferograms of white and blue lead fig 6 two lead white and blue be use to determine the accuracy of the setup since their spectrum be well-defined a show in fig 6 the spectrum seem to be smooth and correspond well to their know spectrum see appendix b however small oscillation be to be see away from the spectras peak these can be attribute to the background noise to capture the background noise an interferogram be create with no light source the result graph show a periodic triangular wave in superposition with a small wave of much large frequency fig 7 after a transformation to the wavelength domain no distinct spike in the visible spectrum can be see however several spike be locate around 17000 nm this be beyond the theoretical range of the detector appendix c thus it must have be add to the measurement after the light detection a possible source might be a charge and discharge capacitor in the vicinity of the photodiode or other electrical component the effect on data quality should be small a the spike be distant to the visible spectrum and can be thus easily filter a tungsten lamp be then use a the light source the result interferogram resembles the white lead a both source have a broad spectrum however the tungsten lamp be show few extremum around the null point thus it must have have a large spectrum this be confirm by the transformation to the wavelength domain fig 8 a continuous gauss-like graph can be see with a peak at ca 850 nm this could however be strongly influence by the detector 's relative spectral sesitivity appendix c due to the curve 's asymmetry the tungsten lamp seem to emit warmer light than the lead additionally the lamp 's temperature be increase during operation hence the infrared spectrum be verify above 700 nm then a green filter fl543.5-10 cw l 543.5 ± 2 nm f w hm 10 ± 2 nm be place in front of the detector this change the structure of the interferogram drastically fig 9 a new local extremum be induced to verify that this be a property of the filter the measurement be retaken three time all interferograms exhibit the same extremum the filter be then replace with a yellow filter fb580-10 cw l 580 ± 2 nm f w hm 10 ± 2 nm the obtain interferograms show similar extremum thus the observe phenomenon be a result of the filter structure moreover it be determine that for the green filter the maximum be space by integer multiple of 6.6 ± 0.7 nm a value could not be establish for the yellow filter the periodicity suggests a quantitative verification of a fabry-perot cavity in the green filter the shape of the yellow filter graph suggests also a qualitative verification however far calculation would be inconclusive due to the large uncertainty connect to the measurement a michelson interferometer be use to inspect the nature of two thin-film filter at first the setup be test for it quality and no problem be detect then the filter be inspect with a tungsten lamp a the light source both be show qualitative characteristic of a fabry-perot cavity a their interferograms be show clear destructive interference pattern however no meaningful calculation could be make due to large uncertainty an improvement of the setup should then allow for a more quantitative understand of the phenomenon for instance a motor with more uniform step or a non-uniform fourier transform would increase the data quality also the detector could take reading with a maximum frequency of 50 hz and thus limited the measurement density vastly additionally it relative spectral sensitivity be strong in the infrared spectrum a detector more sensitive to the visible spectrum would give clearer result fig 10. spectrum of a similar white lead a provide by the

32,2ndINT_TFY667_Redacted,the aim of the experiment be to investigate the property of different light source and filter use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer the null point be found to be -0.86 ± 0.01 mm the mean wavelength of white light from an lead be measure to be 580 ± 5 nm compare to 814 ± 158 nm from a tungsten white light lamp illustrate tungsten a a black body place a green filter on the tungsten source widen the coherence length from 0.818 ± 0.318 µm to 1.80 ± 0.11 µm fourier transforms of interferograms be take and the spectral width explore with systematic error discus to highlight the accuracy of the experiment the michelson interferometer be an extremely precise instrument which have application in physic such a detect gravitational wave and fourier-transform spectroscopy of which the latter be the core of this experiment 1 interferograms can be generate where the light intensity at each wavelength can be analyse the main aim of this experiment be to construct and use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer this be then use to investigate the spectrum of light source with different spectral composition through the interferograms that be create light source analyse include a green laser white lead blue lead and a tungsten white light with and without a green filter property explore include the null point mean wavelength coherence length spectral width and temperature in this instrument light travel from the source to the beamsplitter where it be split into two beam due to the beamsplitter have a partially silver mirror on it face the two beam of light be then reflect off separate mirror and then merge to create an interference pattern at the detector which can be record a an interferogram and analyse a diagram illustrate the schematic of the michelson interferometer and how it work can be show in fig 1. the interference pattern be determine by the path difference of the two beam if the distance from both mirror to the beamsplitter be the same the two beam undergo constructive interference if the path difference differs by half a wavelength the two beam interfere destructively create a dark fringe move one mirror fractionally make the pattern on the detector move between light and dark fringe when the mirror be completely parallel to each other haidinger fringe be form which appear to be circular however if one mirror be tilt slightly fizeau fringe be form which be straight line 2 the layout and mechanism of the michelson interferometer this show the path that the two beam take orange and green before recombine at the beamsplitter again mirror m2 be able to move a distance which be inputted electronically and m1 be fix the dielectric plate creates a phase change for one beam which lead to destructive interference at zero path difference between the two beam by slowly move one mirror about a null point where there be zero path difference between the two beam the output appear a a series of light and dark fringe on an electronic interferogram for a single monochromatic wave fourier transform this into frequency space which display amplitude against wavelength creates a delta function to display the single wavelength if there be only two wavelength present the output on the detector a the mirror be move away from the null point be the result sum of the two sinusoidal intensity distribution with a path difference when these wave be in phase again the overall fringe pattern form be the same a it be at the null point however this only occurs when there be two wavelength if there be more wavelength present the fringe pattern will not be in phase at any other point other than the null point the wavelength spectrum can only be deduce from conduct a fourier transform on the interferogram 2 3 a source have a spectral width ∆ν which be the range of frequency emit by the source or the width of a single spectral line for that case the coherence length be the distance which the move mirror can move before the interferogram contrast becomes poor the wider the spectral line the narrower the interferogram ∆ν can be found from where l be the coherence length m ∆ ν be the spectral width hz this can be change into wavelength use where λ be the mean wavelength 2 4 when a gaussian be fit to the fourier transform interferogram the fwhm of the gaussian be equal to ∆λ where wein 's displacement law can be use to deduce the temperature of a blackbody where t be the temperature k and λ peak be the mean wavelength m 5 after building the interferometer it be then necessary to align it use a green laser a the source we make sure that the laser spot be initially align at the move mirror m2 by block out the stationary mirror m1 this be repeat the other way round it be ensure that the laser beam be parallel to the table surface by make sure that the mirror and beam splitter be at the same height and perpendicular to the table surface two laser spot be form at the detector so we then tilt mirror m1 slightly until they overlap directly at the detector a lense with a focal length of 25mm be place in front of the laser to enlarge the beam and then a lense with a focal length of 100mm be place after the beamsplitter so the fringe could be see the mirror be tilt such that either a light or dark fringe sat in the middle of the detector if this be not the case when the other mirror move it would have take an average of fringe and the interferogram would have be constant the photodetector connect at the output of the interferometer be connect to the pc and the usb port set to low latency a it be attach to an amplifier the gain of the amplifier have to be adjust so that there be no clip on the interferogram when take data we be require to input the position we want the mirror to move to in mm the rate at which we want the stage to move in mm/s and the number of sample that we want to take we trialled the rate at 0.025 mm/s which be estimate use sample size the 50hz sample rate and the distance move after far experimentation we discover that the mirror might have be move too fast a we do n't achieve a sinusoidal form of fringe if the rate be too high the mirror create it 's own vibration which destroyed fringe therefore we calculate the maximum rate that the stage could move use the wavelength of a green laser the detector sample at 50hz and the fact that we want to collect data at least every quarter wavelength this come to a maximum rate of 0.005 mm/s we then low the rate to 0.002 mm/s to ensure that the stage be move slow enough and saw that the interferograms be much well we try to find the null point within 1-2mm use the green laser this be locate at the peak of the wavepacket on the interferogram where there be complete constructive interference start from one end of the stage and move the mirror a small amount we discover a peak and thought it be the null point however after take a large range we discover that there be a beating effect so this may not have be the null point therefore we use a different method with a slow rate of 0.001 mm/s and realign the interferometer we start from one end of the stage and scan a small distance look at the interference pattern when move towards the null point the circular fringe go in towards the centre but when move away from the null point the circular fringe move away from the centre we scan small range and then deduce a small range in which the fringe change direction with the null point range found we replace the source with a white lead source we scan through a small range that contain the null point and observe the interference pattern this be do at a rate of 0.001mm/s with 10 000 sample we repeat this with a blue lead and a white light tungsten source with and without a green filter these interferograms be analyse to find the mean wavelength of the source the coherence length spectral width and temperature for the tungsten source fourier transforms of the interferograms be also take in order to display the wavelength spectrum in frequency space mean wavelength be obtain by measure the length between several wavelength on the interferogram and then divide by the number of wavelength coherence length be measure use the interferogram to deduce the distance between the point where there be poor contrast and the fringe be no longer sinusoidal however result from this method be in the wrong order of magnitude therefore we decide to plot gaussian fit use python onto the fourier transform graph to determine the fwhm from σ in order to obtain the spectral width ∆λ equation 1 and 2 be then use to deduce coherence length the null point be found between -0.9mm and -0.7mm but more precisely at about -0.86 ± 0.01 mm this be found by move the stage extremely slowly between small range within -0.9mm and -0.7mm the result for the characteristic of the different light source be displayed in table 1. it be discover that the stage do not move linearly between sample and that this would lead to systematic error in result the interferogram of white light around the null point be show in fig 2. this agrees with the theory such that there be only constructive interference between all wavelength at the null point so this be the only point where white light fringe be found at all other point all the wavelength be never completely in phase after fourier transform the interferogram the result wavelength spectrum can be show in fig 3 it be important to remove the offset which be create by the background noise before conduct the fourier transform this offset level be see from the value that the stable line of the interferogram be at instead of zero which for white light be 88 000 arbitrary unit compare the mean wavelength obtain in table 1 to the theoretical value of 575 nm which lie within the uncertainty this value only have a 0.87 error 6 the spectral width value be slightly small than it should be when look at the fwhm of the graph in fig 3 where it can be estimate to be about 200nm therefore the main error in our result be due to the fact that the spectrum do n't actually display a gaussian shape and the gaussian fit could be big and wider the interferogram obtain for the blue lead be displayed in fig 4. the fourier transform interferogram can be show in fig 5 where an offset of 15 000 arbitrary unit have be remove compare the mean wavelength obtain in table 1 to the theoretical value of 475 nm which lie within the uncertainty this value only have a 0.42 error the spectral width value we obtain be fairly accurate since look at fig 5 it can be estimate to be about 35nm from the fwhm of the original curve without the gaussian fit this be because the blue lead display a more gaussian-like curve this spectral width be also small than that of white light a expect due to it have a wider interferogram the interferogram obtain for the tungsten white light source be displayed in fig 6 with it 's fourier transform displayed in fig 7. a large offset of 650 000 be remove from this the spectrum look similar to the theoretical spectrum however shorter due to the photodetector only be sensitive to the visible region 7 compare the mean wavelength obtain in table 1 to the theoretical value of about 840nm which lie within the uncertainty there be only a 3 error the change in the mean wavelength from the white lead to the tungsten lamp fig 5. the fourier transform to frequency space of the blue lead interferogram with the gaussian fit this spectrum be a lot narrower than the white lead spectrum due to the interferogram be wider demonstrates the shift from visible light to infrared thus display tungsten 's black body property the spectral width value be small than it should be when look at fig 7 where it can be estimate to be about 300nm this could be due to the spectrum not actually display a gaussian shape but a black body shape tungsten light source exhibit black body emission profile and the temperature of the source at the emission of the peak wavelength can be found use equation 4. this give a value of 3560 k. theoretically this should be around 3200k so this value only have a 11 error 7 the interferogram obtain from the white light tungsten source with a green filter be displayed in fig 8. the narrow bandwidth of the green filter widens the coherence length of the interfere light which the result in table 1 agree with a the coherence length obtain for the tungsten with the green filter be great than without the filter there be also some beating in the interferogram perhaps due to there be two frequency very close together after passing through the filter the fourier transform of the interferogram be show in fig 9 with a offset of 20 000 arbitrary unit have be remove from this the spectral width can be estimate to be 70nm therefore the result we obtain in table 1 be much small however it can clearly be see that the fourier transform spectrum do not have a gaussian shape at all especially since it be part of a white spectrum slope therefore plot a gaussian be inaccurate and maybe two or three gaussians on each spike would have be well the spike be due to the green filter reduce intensity by reduce the number of frequency that can pa through however this gaussian may be useful if one desire to manufacture a product that rely on a coherence length derive from the σ value the mean wavelength in table 1 compare to a theoretical value of about 544nm which lie within the uncertainty in our value other error in the result could be due to the uncertainty in the green filter specification a it claimed to have a central wavelength at 543.5 ± 2 nm and a fwhm at 10 ± 2nm 8 however these be very small uncertainty so can be consider negligible v. conclusion ultimately the michelson interferometer be successfully use a a spectrometer to perform fourier spectroscopy in order to characterise different light source and filter although the result be consistent with the theory they be n't completely accurate systematic error in result obtain be either due to the non linear movement of the stage or the interferometer not be perfectly align error in the spectral width additionally would have be cause by the error in use a gaussian fit to a non-gaussian plot this could have result in the spectral width obtain all be small than they should have be to improve we could try to quantify the variation in the stage 's movement to reduce systematic error and improve result we also could plot gaussian fit to the interferograms rather than the fourier transforms a these displayed more of a gaussian fit,superficial,the,65,0.761591434,0.238408521
2,2ndINT_MFR246_Redacted,in this experiment we explore the spectral composition of blue lead white lead mercury lamp and tungsten lamp use fourier spectroscopy with a michelson interferometer we analyse the blue lead with no filter white lead mercury lamp and tungsten lamp with no filter green filter and yellow filter for the white lead we found that their frequency profile follow a standard

𝟓𝟒𝟔𝒏𝒎 in all case for white lead tungsten lamp and mercury lamp the green and yellow filter produce data which closely overlap the green light range at 𝟓𝟐𝟎 − 𝟓𝟔𝟎𝒏𝒎 and yellow light range at 𝟓𝟔𝟎 − 𝟓𝟗𝟎𝒏𝒎 the michelson interferometer be a common configuration for optical interferometry invent by albert abraham michelson in the 19 th century 1 it be most well-known for it u by albert michelson and edward morley to test for luminiferous aether in the famous michelson-morley experiment in 1887 the null result of which disprove the existence of such an aether 2 the result later lead eventually to the special theory of relativity and the revolution in physic at the begin of the twentieth century a recent application of the michelson interferometer today be found in gravitational-wave detection the existence of which be predict by general relativity a network of international laser interferometer have be construct in several country to detect these wave include the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ligo in the united state virgo in italy geo600 in germany and kagra in japan all of these experiment consist of a michelson interferometer with kilometer-scale arm length the equipment at ligo be sensitive up to 10 −18 m or nearly one-thousandth the diameter of a proton michelson interferometer can thus perform some of the most sensitive length measurement possible ligo and it partner observatory be vastly more complicate than the interferometer in this kit but the fundamental physical principle behind their operation be michelson interferometry 3 in this laboratory session by use the physical principle of the experimental setup and the mathematics of fourier transform the michelson interferometer can be use a a spectrometer to examine the interference fringe of different light source that be brought under investigation in this experiment first discover by joseph fourier when he be look for a mathematical description of the process of heat conduction a fourier transform be the mathematical language use in formulate the equivalence and symmetry of wave or particle in space and time this be illustrate in the follow two equation and where x be the position the wave-signal 's amplitude be measure at 𝜔 be the angular frequency in the fourier frequency-space in the frequency space the amplitude of the signal show how much of each frequency 𝜔 be present in the wave equation 1 show that the fourier transform of any general wave-signal f x take over in physical space −∞ 𝑥 +∞ yield g 𝜔 it fourier representation in frequency space equation 2 show that if the inverse fourier transform be perform on g 𝜔 the original signal will be produce in this way fourier transforms act a a map between the physical representation of a wave and it fourier frequency representation fourier transforms form the mathematical basis for describe couple variable such a position and momentum energy and time in quantum mechanic 4 in classical physic one of the fundamental tenet be that we would be able to determine the frequency of an electromagnetic signal with complete certainty this certainty manifest itself a an infinitely thin diracdelta function 𝛿 𝜔 in the frequency domain with unity height and unity area centre on the know frequency however this tenet do not hold in quantum mechanic where certainty in one measurement creates uncertainty in another variable a a direct result of heisenberg 's uncertainty principle a show in equation 3 the exact frequency of an electromagnetic signal can not be know with complete certainty at any point in time fourier spectroscopy use the michelson interferometer this implies that for a give frequency measurement will arise a a frequency distribution with a central maximum and a finite spread in the form of a gaussian distribution a oppose to a dirac delta function in this experiment we will tabulate the frequency spread of the measurement a well a the bandwidth with it fwhm full-width at half maximum result the michelson interferometer operate base on the principle that the interference of 2 identical light beam will produce constructive interference or destructive interference depend on their path-difference by keep the distance between beamsplitter with mirror 1 and beamsplitter with mirror 2 the reflect and transmit beam will have a path difference of zero the perfectly perpendicular position of the mirror be to retain the cylindrical symmetry of the setup if the cylindrical symmetry be not broken haidinger fringe could be see at infinity but if it be broken fizeau fringe appear at a short finite distance from mirror 1. by keep the orientation of mirror 2 fix and vary it perpendicular distance from the beamsplitter the path length of the two identical beam can be varied to create a haidinger fringe that evolves over time this evolve pattern be record and use fourier transform it could be use to analyse various characteristic of the source by the principle of superposition destructive interference and hence dark fringe would occur when the path difference be 𝜆 𝑛 1 2 whilst constructive interference and hence light fringe would appear when the path difference be 𝑛𝜆 where 𝑛 be the order of interference and an integer where there be no path-difference or 𝑛 0 the point be know a the null point of the michelson interferometer at the null point we expect to find the high light intensity due to maximum constructive interference from the reflect and transmit beam 5 iii method in the michelson interferometer a laser beam be split by a cube beamsplitter the split beam be then reflect back by mirror and recombine at the beamsplitter a screen at the output of the interferometer show an interference pattern a lens be use to diverge the beam in order to obtain an interference pattern consist of light and dark ring constructive or destructive interference respectively the interferometer be set up use the follow step first mirror 1 be position at the edge of the breadboard use four cap screw then the laser assembly be position on the oppose side of the breadboard the laser be then tipped and tilt so that the reflect beam fall back into the laser aperture after that the base be secure to the breadboard with a cap screw the beamsplitter and the screen be instal ensure that the beam be split at a 90° angle that be achieve by observe the secondary reflection on the screen when they coincide with the primary reflection the beamsplitter be at a 90° angle a slight deviation occur in the vertical direction which do not affect the measurement in the experiment the deviation meant that there be a slight tilt among the laser beam splitter and translation stage next mirror 2 be instal the distance between the beamsplitter and the mirror be about the same along both interferometer arm two partial beam be now see a bright spot on the screen the second mirror be tipped and tilt until they overlap finally the lens be place between the laser and the beamsplitter interference ring be see the screw on the adjustment mirror be turn to create interference the screen be move away from the breadboard the lens be place behind the beamsplitter and the screen be move away from the breadboard result in a pattern of stripe instead of ring a screw-on light tube be attach at one end of the beam-splitter for connect the light source to the beamsplitter this be do to ensure perfect alignment between the source and the beam-splitter a well a to prevent the source-light from bleeding into the other quadrant of the michelson interferometer four opaque board be also use to separate the 4 distinct segment and shield light from bleeding between them mirror 2 be held in an optical mirror mount which have 2 rotation knob for precise rotation about it central x and y ax the mirror be set up on a cylindrical diaphragm holder use the lab string and 30 cm rule for measurement the perpendicular distance between both mirror and the beam-splitter be make equal within 1 mm of uncertainty five different light source would be use with the michelson interferometer in the spectroscopy test green collimate laser mainly during setup and not for data collection blue lead white lead tungsten lamp and mercury lamp a 100 mm focal-length magnify glass attach to the light source be place into the receive end of the light-tube the magnify glass be use to broaden the laser-light turn it from a collimated-beam into an extend light-source a white board be place at the position of the detector and two large green circle be see use mirror 1 's precision-rotation knob it orientation be carefully adjust until high contrast haidinger fringe be visible at the detector for the lens three different filter set be available no filter green filter and yellow filter when data collection commenced the screen be replace with a detector connect to the computer a simulation of the michelson interferometer be ran with white light and no filter range from a singlet signal doublet signal triplet signal quartet signal and quintet signal the signal be then process use fourier transform with frequency transform and wavelength transform the white lead source provide be typically a singlefrequency lead usually blue lead make of ingan coat with phosphor of a single colour a a first set of preliminary measurement we take a total of 14 fourier plot and 18 interferograms of white lead at the null point use no filter green filter and yellow filter of the 14 number of interferograms associate with no filter the null point be most commonly found in the range of 0𝑚𝑚 to −0.5𝑚𝑚 and −5𝑚𝑚 a representative sample of the interferograms at the 3 null point be show in figure 2. the fourier plot be obtain by feed the data plot of the interferograms around the null point through an algorithm for fast fourier transform of the 12 fourier plot 7 be reject due to their anomalous shape 3 be reject due to the anomalous wavelength of the peak leave 2 fourier plot which be accepted a result one of which be show in figure 3. the shape and wavelength of the peak of the fourier plot be confirm by the frequency spectrum of a standard phosphor-based white lead a show in figure 4. figure 4 a frequency spectrum of a phosphor-based white lead note again the peak at around 450nm and 550nm 6 in figure 3 and 4 we could see the consistency in the two peak at 450𝑛𝑚 due to the gan-based lead and at 550𝑛𝑚 due to the cerium doped phosphor for white lead with green and yellow filter the interferograms be represent in figure 5 and the fourier plot be show in figure 6. for the blue lead light source the fourier plot and interferograms collect be tabulate in table 2. of the four interferograms collect the null point be around −6.128𝑚𝑚 a represent in figure 7. the two fourier plot have a peak at 400𝑛𝑚 and 310𝑛𝑚 a show in figure 8. give the discrepancy between the peak wavelength of establish literature value of a blue lead and the two fourier plot obtain we conclude that the lead may be emit violet light with wavelength range from 400𝑛𝑚 to 450𝑛𝑚 7 nonetheless the fwhm width of the establish literature value and two fourier plot be in good agreement with each other the tungsten lamp be use a a light source in the michelson interferometer a it act a a form of blackbody radiation table 3 show the number of fourier plot and interferograms of tungsten lamp use no filter green filter and yellow filter of the 6 interferograms associate with no filter the null point be most commonly found near −6.129𝑚𝑚 and −0.004𝑚𝑚 a representative sample of the interferograms at the 2 null point be show in figure 9. of the 3 fourier plot 2 be reject due to the wavelength of the peak leave 1 fourier plot a show in figure 11. the peak at 700𝑛𝑚 be confirm by the establish spectral curve of tungsten lamp with no filter a show in figure 12. give the proximity of the data peak at 700𝑛𝑚 and the spectral curve peak at 850𝑛𝑚 we conclude that the data for tungsten with no filter be reliable for tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter the interferograms and fourier plot be show in figure 13 and figure 14. the wavelength interval of green light be establish at 520 − 560𝑛𝑚 and yellow light be establish at 560 − 590𝑛𝑚 7 with reference to figure 14 we can see that there be an overlap of 520 − 560𝑛𝑚 between the fourier plot and establish literature value for green light and 560 − 590𝑛𝑚 for yellow light we also note that the shape of the green filter and yellow filter fourier plot closely resembles a gaussian envelope the mercury discharge lamp be use a a light source in the michelson interferometer table 4 show the number of fourier plot and interferograms of mercury lamp use no filter green filter and yellow filter a representative sample of the interferograms associate with the mercury lamp be show in figure 15. the fourier plot associate with the mercury lamp be show in figure 16. we carry out fourier transform spectroscopy on four different light source a white and blue lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapor lamp the white lead source give a frequency profile similar to the know distribution for a white phosphor lead there be an overlap of 520 − 540𝑛𝑚 between the fourier plot and establish literature value for green light use the green filter and 560 − 590𝑛𝑚 for yellow light use the yellow filter for the blue lead we note that the peak wavelength at 400𝑛𝑚 suggests that the lead be emit violet light with wavelength range from 400𝑛𝑚 to 450𝑛𝑚 the fwhm width data be consistent with literature value with both at around 20𝑛𝑚 to 25𝑛𝑚 we also note that the shape of the green filter and yellow filter fourier plot closely resembles a gaussian envelope the tungsten lamp without filter peaked at 700𝑛𝑚 which be consistent with the establish spectral curve which peaked at 850𝑛𝑚 for tungsten lamp with green and yellow filter we could see that there be an overlap of 520 − 560𝑛𝑚 between the fourier plot and establish literature value for green light and 560 − 590𝑛𝑚 for yellow light we also note that the shape of the green filter and yellow filter fourier plot closely resembles a gaussian envelope the peak of mercury lamp with no filter at around 400𝑛𝑚 and 500𝑛𝑚 be confirm by establish mercury spectral which peaked at 405𝑛𝑚 and 546𝑛𝑚 the wavelength interval of green light be establish at 520 − 560𝑛𝑚 and yellow light be establish at 560 − 590𝑛𝑚 for mercury lamp with green and yellow filter we could see that there be an overlap of 520 − 550𝑛𝑚 between the fourier plot and establish literature value for green light and 560 − 590𝑛𝑚 for yellow light,superficial,bal,60,0.789856434,0.210143536

source and filter interference occurs when two or more wave meet and the resultant wave be the vector sum of the displacement of the individual wave depend on the phase difference between the wave either constructive or destructive interference occurs this fundamental concept underpins optical physic and be the basis for the michelson interferometer the michelson interferometer be design towards the end of the 19 th century a part of the michelson-morley experiment which be set up to test the relative motion of matter through ether contrary to what the then-prevalent ether theory predict albert michelson and edward morley discover no difference in the speed of light in different direction albert einstein credit this experiment for lay the groundwork for research into alternate theory which soon lead to his theory of special relativity today the michelson interferometer can be refine use computer to facilitate very precise measurement of length and be use in the famous recent direct observation of gravitational wave in 2015. in this experiment one of the mirror in the michelson interferometer be move through a range produce a pattern of constructive and destructive

fft light be emit from a source and arrives at the beam splitter which separate the light into two different beam a and b travel at right angle to each other these beam both reflect off mirror m1 and m2 respectively and recombine to form beam c at the beam splitter before travel to the detector by the principle the condition for constructive or destructive interference between two monochromatic plane wave of path difference ∆𝑑 be where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the wave and 𝑛 ∈ ℕ. when n be even there will be constructive interference and when n be odd there will be destructive interference in this experiment the path difference between the two wave can be see to be t in figure 1. the null point be the point at which the two beam of light have no path difference and corresponds to t 0 meaning that both beam travel exactly the same distance between be split by and then return to the beam splitter normally at this point there be constructive interference between the two wave the beam splitter use have a partially silver surface on one side and a dielectric plate on the other side the dielectric plate on the beam splitter cause a phase change of 180 degree in the beam that be reflect this mean that the two beam will interfere differently for a give distance from the null point at t 0 the beam will now destructively interfere a they be in antiphase and in equation 2 when n be even there will be destructive interference and when n be odd constructive interference occurs to produce an interferogram the path difference t be varied and result be collect the result interferograms can be approximate use a gaussian function of the form here a be an arbitrary constant great than zero the fourier transform of this function be then where 𝜔 represent angular frequency this can be solve through integration by part to produce a gaussian in 𝜔-space the spectral width of a spectral line refers to the width of that line and we can see from equation 3 and 5 that there be an inverse relationship between the width of the interferogram and the gaussian spectral line finally the coherence length a quantity sometimes use to describe the spectral quality of a light source be define to be the fwhm of the interferogram for the source the relationship between spectral width and coherence length be where δ𝑣 be the spectral width l be the coherence length and c be the speed of light the apparatus be set up in accordance with the schematic in figure 1 with a piece of string be use to ensure the length of the two arm of the interferometer be equal it be also necessary to ensure that the interferometer be precisely align to avoid error in the wavelength value to do this a green laser be use a the source and the detector be remove this meant that the laser beam would continue on and so a card be place approximately 1m away on the path of the 2 beam if there appear to be two dot on the card then the interferometer be not align correct and the position of the source need to be adjust until the two dot completely overlap and interference fringe could be see by eye next in order to obtain interferograms that can be use to determine the wavelength of the source the null point must first be locate a green laser be use and the moveable mirror be programmed to move across different distance interval and it be observe by eye if the fringe where either expand or contract a neither of the mirror be tilt circular haidinger fringe be observe this experiment the interval locate in which the fringe change from expand to contract be first found to be at distance +5.5mm to +6.1mm from the mirror 's default position now the green laser be replace with a white light source and the mirror set to move over this interval at a speed of 0.002mm/s a the detector sample the signal at a rate of 50hz 15000 sample be require so that data collection and the moveable mirror stop at the same time in the interferogram produce it be expect that there will be a large spike in the signal around the null point figure 2 illustrates this from figure 2 it be clear that the null point be at 5.67mm there appear to be a slight asymmetry in the interferogram and it be believe that the cause of this be due to the light beam still be structure this can be correct by use a ground glass diffuser have found the null point data can now be collect to determine the wavelength of different light source for all the reading the mirror be move over an interval of 0.6mm with the null point at the centre at a speed of 0.002mm/s and 15000 sample be take -- -- -- first a white light source be investigate figure 3 be the fft of the interferogram in figure 2. this result agrees with the theoretical prediction of two peak at 460nm and 600nm however there also appear to be a sinusoidal dependence in figure 2 which ca n't be explain by the theo1y possible explanation for this be that the fluctuation have arisen from a misalignment in the apparatus or possibly due to small vibration cause by movement while data be be collect the next reading be perfo1med on a different day and so the null point have to be locate again in case the apparatus have be move or random vibration have alter the point slightly use a tungsten light source with no filter the null point be found to be 6.014mm figure 4 a fft be perfo1med on this interferogram and an value for the mean wavelength of 900nm be obtain this be close to the theoretical value of 850nm provide by the manufacturer of the source the tungsten light source be then investigate with filter figure 5 and 6 depict the interferograms and result of fft these for green and yellow filter respectively a the filter only allow a nan ow range of wavelength through theoretically we expect to observe a wideenvelope gaussian a can be see in these figure additionally the theoretical prediction for wavelength of 543nm and 580nm for the green and yellow filter respectively agree with the experimental result the aim of this experiment be to build a michelson interferometer and use it to perform fourier transform spectroscopy to identify the wavelength of different light source while the experiment be successful in accurately obtain value for the wavelength in line with theoretical prediction a more rigorous treatment of the associate error could have be include the experiment could have be far extend by apply gaussian fit to the graph from which the standard deviation could be calculate which would provide an uncertainty on the wavelength in addition to this the speed use for the mirror 's movement be determine through trial and error however a more accurate method could have be to use nyquist 's theorem to determine the optimum rate of take sample to prevent either under or over sample another area of the experiment that could be improve be the effect of background light on the reading while it would not have be possible to take reading in complete darkness due to other experiment be conduct nearby this experiment could have be optimise by ensure that the background light be constant during reading and other lamp nearby be n't be switch on or off 6

26,2ndINT_GKW379_Redacted,i ~te1ferometers be optical instrument that produce optical mterference pattems the most well-known type be the michelson inte1ferometer input light beam go through a beam splitter and then reflect by two mi1rnrs place pe1pendicularly produce two approximate equal intensity beam eventually recombine at the beam splitter and a1riving at the detector to allow interlerence to examine if the optical path length of the two beam do not differ to much l the michelson interlerometer gain attention during the famous experiment on july 12 1887 conduct by albert a. michelson and edward w morley in which they tiy to prove the existence of the ether -an invisible medium thought to pem1eate the universe that allows light wave to travel in just like air act a a medium allow sound wave to propagate through in the experiment one pa1t of the device be position parallel to the motion of the eaiih while the other pa1t be pe1pendicular 2 the result hop to see in the recombine beam that one pait of the beam be slow down by the ether but there be no path difference observe although the experiment fail in prove the existence of ether it be the first attempt in use interlerometiy experimentally and lead to many more well-known interferometiy technique fourier ti•ansfo1m specti•ometer ft be one of them it be just a michelson interlerometer but with one miitor be adjustable with the scan of the move miitor over va1y distance an interferogram be produce which can be use to construct the spectnun of the light source use a fourier transform 3 2.theory the schematic diagram for the ft be show in figure 1. there be three main possible outcome at the detector at determine the interlerogram of the light source ai•ound a small range of distance case 1 when the split light travel the same distance the detector will receive constructive interference pattem it be these 3 case contribute to the construction of the fringe show in front of the detector for the actual direct observation of the interlerence pattem in front of the detector possibly a screen place in front of the detector the orientation of the two mi1rnr dete1mines what fringe be produce which be haidinger fringe and fizeau fringe by refening to figure 2 the cause of the two different type of ftinges be due to whether the two miitors be place parallel to each other or not by consider an extend source place behind the observer and look into one mi1rnr where the other miitor appear to be inside a show in figure 3. the two miitors represent two dark vertical line separate by a distance tthe difference in the travel distance of the two split light and 0 which be the angle of reflection of the incoming ray by change the orientation of one miitor from it original perpendicular state will introduce a path difference between ray of reflect light that destroys the cylindrical symmetry cause the formation of fizeau fringe that be n't circular but rather straight-linefringes 7 the equation that describes the angle 0 assume the refractive index of the medium be 1 be described by 2tcos0 mil 1 where m be the order of interference the spectrum of a light source be typically a gaussian distribution described in figure 5. so there be different frequency of light and when they interfere with each other a null point exist where all of the wavelength constructive interfere with each other show in figure 6 in which only 3 different type of wave be include this null-point exist at x =o that creates the large constructive interference throughout the graph although the actual set-up of the ft be show in figure 7 which be orientate in the same way a with figure 1. mirror a be place on a motor control through the computer make it the movable mirror of the set-up mirror b be fix to the stage and remains stationary for the entire experiment a screen be place instead of a detector to show the recombine beam of light to increase visibility in the fringe a piano-convex lens f=25.4mm lens be add at the begin of the source before the laser reach the beam splitter hence an enlarge image show on the white screen to make sure the two mittors be perfectly align pe1pendicularly tlte resultant fringe pattem should appear to be haidinger fringe by fix the move 1nittor a and adjust tlte stationary mirror b until haidinger fringe appear on the white sere en in order for more accurate measurement of the fringe afte1w ards the concentric circle of the fringe be set that the center of the circle be locate at the center of the broaden image on screen in detennining the position of tlte null point the distance between one mirror a and the beam splitter need to vaiy by set up three variable of tlte motor x y and z x the position that be set for the stage to move until and stop in mm y the speed of the stage move in llllll z number of sample that will be take until the detector stop reading in data an initial reading of x y z 10 0.02 10000 be take sta1ting from 0nun the result be show in figure 8. the resultant graph be very noisy and the increase signal strength towai•ds the peak be n't smooth this be due to set the speed of the stage too high 0.02 mm/s that creates aliasing to the sinusoidal wave instead of produce a sine wave result triangular wave ai•e instead produce to improve decrease the speed and increase the number of sample with the improvement a reading be take for x y z 5 0.01 15000 sta1ting from -5mm the result be show in figure 9. the intensity of the light seem to increase over the whole range a show in the graph there be an upwards shift trend this be due to tlte tv.•o mi1rnrs not be perfectly pe1pendicular to each other a slightly tilt mirror that get enhance significantly over a lai•ge range l0nun the system should be recalibrated and if this problem still exists by fitting a straight-line for tlte overall trend and subtract it from the original data will give out a horizontal flat trend instead with realignment and x y z 10 0.01 50000 start from -10mm a combine image of -10mm to 0mm 0mm to 10mm be show in figure 10. there be an increase trend in the intensity signal and all the constmctive and destmctive interference be show a peak and zero amplitude after dete1mining the range that the null point exist a furthermore detailed data record with x y z 9.6 0.002 20000 start from 8.9mm be take place and be show in the red box area to detemline whether the point be the null point refen-ing back to equation 1 when move around the peak m and /4 be kept constant meaning a t tends towards 0 a the distance travel by the two light beam be turn the same co 0 will have to get large hence 0 get small and the radius of the circle of the fringe will decrease so if the fringe get small and small that represent a null point after make sure the alignment be con-ect and the null point be found by use the monochromatic laser a a light source interferograms of a white lead blue lead tungsten light and tungsten light with yellow filter can be obtain the result be described in figure 11-14. the ultimate goal be to determine the mean wavelength of these light source by do a fourier transfo1m of the interferogram to obtain the spectnun this allows identification of the light source include the wavelength of light include in the spectmm the fourier transform of all of the light source be show in figure 15-18. it contains all the visible spectrum and be more into the infra red this be expect a tungsten light bulb have ve1y low efficiency and radiates a lot of heat through infra red radiation a gaussian be fit and the error be determine by the standard deviation 1030±136 nm • -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- fourier transform of the tungsten light source but with a yellow filter a lorentzian be fit and the standard deviation be give the error 538±30 nm this be indeed in the range of the yellow color of the visible spectrum the filter do allow only yellow light through and filer out other wavelength overall the ft give both good result in the interferogram and determine the spectrum of the light source it have determine the wavelength of the yellow filter tungsten light closest to the theoretical value compare to the others in which others all shift slightly more towards a high wavelength then the theoretical value this be due to the limitation of the move stage except the yellow filter tungsten light source with other light source the speed set to move be all 0.0001mm/s which be found to be too slow when processing the data go far into the graph of these interferograms it can be see that the stage seem move backwards slightly every time it want to move forward a illustrate in figure 19. the fourier transform relies on equal interval between each data point the record data be n't equal cause some failure in the fourier transform contribute to the shift of the spectrum figure 19. enlarge of the interferogram to a very small scare 20µm it can be see that the stage do n't move in equal interval and sometimes even move backwards this be n't visible in the overall graph but be reflect on the shift of the fourier transform by give the stage a slow speed 1/10 of the speed use for others for the yellow filter tungsten light source the method be efficient and successful in determine the spectrum but might introduce aliasing and noise which will affect the final result other factor include alignment issue i.e mirror be n't perfectly perpendicular to each will also affect the result to avoid this a green laser for the set up the ft will always be useful and quick to

7,2ndINT_RAK801_Redacted,this experiment revolve around the construction and use of a michelson interferometer the interferometer be set up from scratch use the part give and align use a green laser diode we first determine the null point of the interferometer use white light interference we record the interferograms of different light source such a white lead blue lead a white light tungsten source and the tungsten with a yellow filter the interferograms be study and provide evidence that the broader the interferogram the narrower the spectral line in 1881 albert a. michelson design an interferometer which be a device base on the phenomenon of interference of light wave that be base on the find of the experiment conduct by thomas young many year ago a michelson interferometer be a device that measure small distance through the observation of interference pattern create by recombine a split light beam with part that have travel different optical path 1 it be an important tool in experimental physic with many application in different branch of science a prominent example be the detection of gravitational wave use in ligo laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory which earn the 2017 nobel prize in physic figure 1 show the ligo site which use the michelson interferometer to detect gravitational wave 2 the michelson interferometer also played an important role in research the temperature and wind of the upper atmosphere this be possible by measure the doppler width and shift in the spectrum of aurora which be do by the wind image interferometer windii on the upper atmosphere research satellite uars 3 a the michelson interferometer determines the type of interference the condition to obtain constructive interference be for the path difference to be 𝑛𝜆 where n be an integer this mean that the two wave will be exactly in phase and will add to produce maximum intensity alternatively if the distance travel by the beam be exactly 𝑛 𝜆 destructive interference will occur lead to no light be incident on the detector this make the michelson interferometer extremely precise a move either mirror by half a wavelength lead to either a bright fringe or a dark fringe appear on the detector the nature of the fringe observe depends on the set up of the interferometer and how it be illuminate if the two mirror be not at right angle to each other and we may either send collimate light into it parallel ray come from infinity or an extend source may be use refer to figure 1 figure 2 show that look into the instrument mirror m2 appear to be at the position of m2 if the arm differ in length by t the observer see the light originate from an extend source be reflect from two mirror separate by a distance of t. we can choose either to tilt slightly one of the mirror or to leave it 'correctly align the angle 𝜃 of the incoming ray will vary ray of wavelength 𝜆 will reinforce each other at specific value of 𝜃 at which constructive interference occurs a show in figure 4 a the cylindrical symmetry show that haidinger fringe appear to be circular by tilt one mirror the cylindrical symmetry be broken so that fizeau fringe form straight line c use the interferometer a a spectrometer when a single monochromatic wave be direct into a michelson interferometer the output be a series of bright and dark fringe which can be record if the input light consists of two distinct frequency the sequence of fringe be modulate the separation between null in the interferogram be related to the separation of the two frequency in frequency space figure 5 show that the relationship be reciprocalthe closer the two frequency be to each other the far separate the null be in the interferogram 4 figure 5 show that a t be scan two wave of different λ get out of phase lead to a diminution of the contrast of the fringe however the wave will rephrase and the contrast will be restore 4 assume that the initial set-up of the interferometer with exactly equal arm length m=0 the output be observe a the mirror be be scan the actual output see be the sum of the two intensity distribution show the length of the fringe train show be such that a one move away from the zero path difference point the fringe form by the longer of the two wavelength be almost begin to 'çatch up with the fringe form by the shorter wavelength this cause the overall fringe pattern to be like that at zero order although it be only true at that point when there be only two wavelength the mathematics of fourier transforms can be apply to a source with an arbitrary spectrum the spectral line shape of a light source be approximately gaussian a the intensity be decrease with distance the broader the spectral line the narrower the interferogram from the interferograms of each different source the mean wavelength can be obtain this be possible a the path difference between two consecutive minimum on the interferogram .x be a multiple of half of the wavelength give by nl where n be a positive integer since we measure the distance between two consecutive minimum on the interferogram n be assume to be 1. we assume that this be the mean wavelength from the source and that the sample distance be constant the coherence length l could be obtain and use to find the spectral width .v with the fo1mula c v x l 2n 2 where c be the speed of light 4 to tum this into wavelength the fo1mula 3 where a be the mean wavelength of the source 4 before we begin constrncting the michelson interferometer we developed a simulation of the interferometer and study the type of result expect we could manipulate variable such a the speed at which the lliltor move how far the lliltor move between sample a well a the number of sample take this be possible a the sample rate be constant at 50 hz the simulation give an output expect from a light source with a give gaussian profile and specify width it be also possible to reconstrnct the light source use a fourier transfo1m function call fast fourier transfo1m fft figure 7 show the setup of the michelson intel'ferometer in our laboratory the michelson intef erometer be set up a show in figure 7 one of the lliltors be mount on a linear motor stage that be fix to the base the motor be kept on the linear stage throughout the whole experiment firstly the beam-splitter be connect to a green laser diode with a piano-convex with a focal length of 100 mm this be position in front of the fix lliltor use a string and rnler the adjustable lliltor be position perpendicular to the beamsplitter-fixed miitor line it be ensure there be no 'double point so both miitors be parallel to the beam-splitter a white card be place in front of the photodetector to far align the interferometer this be do by tilt the adjustable lliltor to have the laser spot from both aim of the beam-splitter directly on top of each other at the output once the interferometer be align the photodetector be connect to the computer via usb the photodetector be a photodiode attach to an amplifier with a variable gain which sainples at a rate of 50 hz we proceed with the task of seai•ching for the null point of the inteferometer which be define a the point at which t 0. this be study by use the white lead source and observe the interference pattern throughout the movement of the mirror white light be the optimum choice a it have a wide range of frequency which translates to a narrow peak on the interferogram which be easy to notice once the interferometer be set up we start take interferograms of other light source these include a blue lead white light tungsten source with green and yellow filter the procedure be repeat for the white lead with a small range of distance around the null point to give a high resolution for the interferogram we use a range of 2.40mm -2.415mm with a speed of 5𝑥10 −5 mm -1 the process be repeat with the other aforementioned light source and the gain of the photodetector be varied depend on the light source a show in figure 21331 the spike occurs at the null point where t 0. the null point be found to be 2.40816 ± 0.00002 mm and the uncertainty in position be determine by visualling zoom in the interferogram the range of distance be narrow down close to the null point and the interferogram for white lead obtain be a show in figure 9. the blue lead produce a broader interferogram than the white lead with a peak wavelength of … a show in figure 10. table i show the feature of the interferograms that be study without perform fft along with it uncertainty overall the value of ∆λ be small and this may be due to approximation and assumption involve in the equation they do however provide evidence that the broader the interferogram l the narrower ∆λ which be show in the blue lead and tungsten source with a yellow filter in this experiment we construct a michelson interferometer from scratch and align it with a green laser diode this be proceed with find the

11,2ndINT_LSK572_Redacted,the michelson interferometer be use a spectroscope to examine different type of light source around the null point a white lead blue lead white tungsten source with green and yellow filter and a green laser be use within the interferometer to obtain interferograms from the interferograms the spectral width be calculate and compare with the theoretical relationship that a great spectral width corresponds to a longer coherence length the michelson interferometer be an experimental device which utilises interference to measure wavelength and fringe separation with great precision on the order of several nanometre it be first use in the michelson-morley experiment to attempt to measure the relative motion of earth to the ethera hypothesise medium for electromagnetic wave 1 this laid the foundation which eventually lead to the first detection of gravitational wave in 2015 by ligo 2 the setup of the michelson interferometer be relatively simple give the level of precision the interferometer consists of two mirror a beam splitter with an attach dielectric plate a source of monochromatic wave and a detector the mirror m2 be fix while mirror m1 be mount on a moveable stage which can be move towards or far away from the beam splitter the beam splitter be compose of a glass plate with a silver surface the silver surface cause the incident ray from the source to be split into two beam one beam pas through towards m2 while the other be reflect towards m1 the two beam be reflect by their respective mirror and recombine once again at the beam splitter before be measure by the detector the dielectric plate cause a phase shift of the beam go towards b by λ/2 the two beam will recombine accord to the principle of superposition since both beam originate from the same monochromatic and coherent source interference will occur when the beam be in phase and the peak of one beam coincides with the peak of the other constructive interference will occur when in antiphase the peak of one beam will be counteract by the trough of the other cause destructive interference the phase difference between the two beam which be reflect off the mirror m1 and m2 will depend on the distance between m1 and the beam splitter m2 be the position of m1 which would be equidistant from the beam splitter a m2 this be refer to a the null point which be when t 0 where t be the distance between m1 and m2 when t be equal to zero or an integer multiple of λ constructive interference would be expect at the detector while if t be equal to an odd integer multiple of λ/2 destructive interference would be expect to be see however due to the dielectric plate on the beam splitter the opposite be see so that destructive interference occurs when there be no path difference constructive interference corresponds to a bright fringe while destructive interference corresponds to a dark fringe the light source be use throughout this experiment can be consider a extend source due to the width of the incident ray laser source be use in conjunction with a lens which widens the ray this make the alignment of the interferometer easy a the fringe be more visible the pattern of the fringe depends on the tilt of mirror m2 a extend source be be use interference depends on the angle of the incident ray which strike the mirror some specific angle will lead to path difference which be an integer multiple of λ between consecutive ray if m1 and m2 be perpendicular circular haidinger fringe be visible which be the one present in this experiment if m2 be tilt straight fizeau fringe be present instead michelson interferometer the interferometer can be use a a spectrometer by take measurement around the null point for a single monochromatic wave from the source the detector would measure a series of bright and dark fringe if the light source be compose of two or more distinct wavelength then the record output would not be a simple series of fringe for example beating be present in the interferogram when there be two distinct wavelength the two distinct wavelength also correspond to two distinct frequency depend on the frequency the interferogram for each single frequency will be slightly different both will display a maximum at the null point and a series of oscillation between maximum and minimum which be symmetrical around the null point however the distance between subsequent maximum will be different depend on the wavelength or frequency a high frequency lead to a shorter distance between the maximum since there be two distinct frequency the distance between the maximum of one of the frequency and the maximum of the other be change a measurement be take far from the null point however the two maximum will coincide at several point include the null point when this happens the interferogram of both combine will display an intensity that be at a maximum point in between these maximum will show a decrease to a minimum before increase in intensity until the next maximum the distance between the maximum on the interferogram be determine by the difference in frequency of the two wave a small difference in frequency lead to a great distance a the maximum of the separate wave will coincide less often the incoming source of the michelson interferometer can be represent with an electromagnetic spectrum graph the distinct wavelength mention before would be model by a dirac distribution 3 these be also call spectral line a the width of the spectrum be very narrow most source do not have a single spectral line a they have a range of frequency which be present this can be represent by a gaussian distribution which be centre around the frequency which be most prevalent in the source 4 the spectral width of such a source refers to the range of frequency that make up the incident light on the beam splitter the interferogram which be output by the michelson interferometer can be analyse by use fourier transforms this process return the electromagnetic spectrum which show the range of frequency which the source contains however the interferograms be skewed which lead to fourier transforms not be a effective in these case there be formula which can be use to calculate the spectral width of the source where ∆𝜈 be the spectral width in hz l be the coherence length in m and c be the speed light in a vacuum coherence length can be found on the interferogram and be the distance over which the interferometer be effective at scan this can then be convert into a range of wavelength use the follow formula where λ be the mean wavelength in m and ∆𝜆 be the range of wavelength present in the source due to the interferograms be slant the fourier transforms be not a effective at return the mean frequency and spectral width therefore the two above equation can be use to find these two value there be an inverse relationship between the spectral width and the coherence length the narrower the spectral width the broader the coherence length of the interferogram the mean frequency be calculate by use the frequency of the oscillation in the interferogram the simulation follow the theory that a wider spectral width lead to a narrower interferogram the simulation be run use a red laser source although a green one be use when take data the same scale be use for the distance from the null point on the x ax on both fig 4 and fig 5. a simulation of a white light source be also useful so that the predict pattern around the null point be know this give a basis of comparison when attempt to find the null point use a white lead source the interferometer be align use a green laser source and lens which increase the diameter of the light incident on the beam splitter m2 be adjust by use precise screw which tilt the mirror the mirror m2 be tilt until fringe be visible at the output the stage be move by use the linux console there be three parameter which be input into the software for the move stage end point speed of stage and number of measurement the detector have a sample rate of 50 hz which be equivalent to 50 measurement occur every second the beam splitter be securely bolt down so that it move minimally when attach or remove different source however the equipment be extremely sensitive and precise and so the null point constantly shift when change source the interferometer also require realignment at the start of every lab session this alignment take upwards of 40 minute the first time it be attempt a we get more familiar with the equipment this be manage in 10 minute or less the first interferogram be a green laser source it be take to get familiar with use the linux console to record measurement however the suppose monochromatic source show beating which suggests a second less intense wavelength be also present in the source this can be compare to the interferogram show in fig 3 which be for two distinct frequency be present a this be not the desire result a new green laser be use which be monochromatic the number of sample take lead to an interferogram which be difficult to analyse there be an increase in amplitude the far to the right the stage move this suggests that the null point be present at a distance that be far to the right the null point of a monochromatic source would be when the interferogram be at a maximum however the entire gaussian distribution for the interferogram be much wider on the order of several millimetre there be a payoff between the time it take to record the data and the resolution if the resolution be high which corresponds with the stage move at a slow rate it take longer to record since there be limited lab time quick calculation be make to reach a compromise between the two factor a white lead source be now use to try and find the null point the pattern show in fig 5 be the one which corresponds to the null point for a white light source first a rough and low resolution interferogram be take around where the null point be estimate to be locate the range of the measurement would be a few millimetre and the null point would be show a a vertical line in the data then a second high resolution interferogram be take around this point to obtain one that be similar to the simulation show in fig 5. the record interferogram for the white lead be asymmetric while the simulation displayed an interferogram that be symmetrical about the null point this may be due to imperfection of the mirror or the beam splitter this asymmetry be also found when the interferogram be record again which suggests an error within the setup be the cause with the null point have be found we can use the interferometer a a spectroscope for other light source the light source which be be investigate be a white lead blue lead and a white light tungsten source with a green and yellow filter the interferogram for the white light tungsten source with the green filter be not include a the result obtain be dominate by noise the green filter lead to the light reach the detector to be too dim even with the gain of the detector turn up to the maximum the background light and electrical fluctuation of the source cause the data to be inadequate the coherence length obtain from the interferograms can then be use in equation 1 to find the spectral width of the different source the coherence length be give below white lead − 5.6 × 10 −6 m white tungsten − 9.8 × 10 −6 m blue lead − 1.5 × 10 −5 m white tungsten with yellow filter − 3.4 × 10 −5 m. after use these coherence length in equation 1 the spectral width be calculate a such white lead − 8.5 × 10 12 hz white tungsten − 4.9 × 10 12 hz blue lead − 3.2 × 10 12 m white tungsten with yellow filter − 1.4 × 10 12 m. the white light source have a great spectral width than the single colour this be expect since white light be compose of several different frequency within the visible spectrum look up literature value for blue and yellow light show that the spectral width that have be calculate be not great than the range for those colour blue light have a frequency interval of approximately 610 -670 thz and yellow light have a frequency interval of approximately 510 -540 thz 5 the value for the spectral width of both colour that have be experimentally obtain be small than the frequency interval there be a lack of error analysis due to a lack of time the error and uncertainty will arise from several factor the precision of the measurement of the stage movement by the computer the noise present in the interferogram particularly for dimmer light source and the measurement of the coherence length will be source for error,extended,the,80,0.816941082,0.183058918
23,2ndINT_UGX035_Redacted,the wavelength spectrum of white lead blue lead and tungsten source be found use the michelson interferometer setup a a fourier transform spectrometer the aim of the experiment be to explore the characteristic of light source whilst investigate the effectiveness of the apparatus the white lead blue lead and tungsten source with a yellow filter have wavelength of 522.0 nm 490.4 nm and 574.0 nm with negligible error these result agree with the accepted range despite their complex distribution the result be not quite precise which highlight how appropriate a gaussian fit might have be the main reason for inaccuracy be the background disturbance and misalignment t he michelson interferometer be an important device in spectroscopy it provide a path way for light along which it split into two beam with different path the beam then recombine to produce interference pattern the variation in path length be due to a movable stage which process on a scale low than millimetre combine this with the fact that light in the visible region be on the nanometre scale this mean the michelson interferometer be an incredibly precise instrument that be delicate because calibration be key to it functionality exploit the property of this setup allows wavelength spectrum of different light source to be explore by combine it with fourier transform theory in addition to these the michelson interferometer have real world application particularly in astrophysics in which the refractive index of gas and the spectrum of star can be determine 1 fringe occur in interferometry due to repeat constructive and destructive interference which produce alternate dark and bright line the michelson interferometer which be displayed in fig 2 undergoes interference through the variation in the distance from the null point this result in a path difference between the two arm of the interferometer a one beam of light travel far than the other if the mirror be parallel the two wave will appear to be come from a source at infinity because the beam be always parallel this result in circular haidinger fringe a the symmettry be cylindrical if the mirror be n't parallel the source be effectively at a finite position close to the mirror so straight fizeau fringe occur these be drawn in fig 1. constructive interference occurs when the path difference be an integer number of wavelength a the two wave be in phase and this rule give rise to equation s1 where ∆r be the path difference θ be the angle to the horizontal and λ. light can be model a a sinusoidal plane wave in this case the angle θ be 0 o meaning the path difference be twice the distance move by the stage a the beam move through that distance twice upon reflection the variation of path difference give an interference pattern which will be characteristic for different wavelength spectrum change the arm length of the interferometer allows an arbitrary spectrum to be plot in which intensity varies with distance from the null point the space in which the intensity be plot can have it dependence change through the use of a fourier transform a show by equation 2 the reversal of this can be perform use the inverse fourier transform in equation 3 the fringe present on the interferogram follow the shape of a gaussian or similar to it which when transform by definition will give a gaussian shape too a equation 4 show transform the fringe into an electromagnetic spectrum will change the shape of gaussian inversely a demonstrate by equation 5. this be because a narrower gaussian will give a wider one and vice vers a the standard deviation be change 2 where the standard deviation of the transform gaussian be the spectral line can be express in frequency and wavelength space in both they be position at a mean value these line have a spectral width which be a measure of the range of value correspond to that line the interferogram which be a plot of intensity against distance or time be in the time domain so can be express a f t a fourier transform yield the spectral line which be in the frequency domain express a f ω the mathematical process can be carry out in python which involves a fast fourier transform algorithm in which the interferogram be transform into intensity against oscillation per step this can then be reconstruct into a wavelength spectrum the coherence length be the range over which the contrast be readable on the interferogram therefore it be the distance over which the sinusoidal wave be distinct the spectral width ∆ν be related to this length by equation 6 where c be the speed of light equation 7 show how the guassian envelop of an interferogram have a fwhm that relates to the coherence length a this be the standard deviation the spectral width be related to the wavelength spectrum through equation 9 where λ be the wavelength 3 the whole interferometer be set up in a black optical enclosure with cover prevent unwanted light from enter the experiment therefore reduce the background intensity during the setup and the experiment care be take with the optical equipment to ensure that it be not scratch or have no fingerprint a these would affect the path of the light and their intensity it be also clean with a fluid before use to far ensure this furthemore additional care be take not to knock any apparatus a any slight movement would affect the alingments a well a strict precaution to avoid look directly at light source .. the michelson interferometer be construct on a stage a illustrate in fig 2. the system be kept a compact a possible with short distance to increase the accuracy a ruler be use to keep everything at the same height one mirror be place on a fix stage that could move adjacent to this be a beam splitter that be position at the middle of the interferometer another fix mirror be clamped onto the platform adjacent to the beam splitter it be tilt to ensure the alignment give clear fringe the source be also position directly opposite the mirror the detector be place close to the beam splitter the beam splitter consists of a partially-silvered mirror which split the source into two beam at right angle to one another a well a a dielectric plate which applies a phase change to a beam and recombines it with the other lens be use to broaden and sharpen the source upon enter the beam splitter and the detector the light source be cast on a distant screen with a dark background for the alignment procedure to ensure the overlap be accurate and the circle be large this be do by tilt the mirror it be also ensure the beam be focus centrally on the beam splitter the null point be the point at which maximum constructive interference occurs a the arm of the interferometer be the same length the null point be significant a it be around this point that the information of the source be best found a interference and coherence be great the stage and detector be operate use linux and three command be give to them these include the position in millitres to where the stage be to be move the speed in millimetre per second at which it would move and the number of reading for the detector to take thorlab be also use in conjuction with the detector so that the plot could be view in a live plot a quick scan be take of the whole range with a green laser to view the overall profile of the interferogram and highlight potential region of where the null point might be the variation of the distance from the null point cause the fringe to move a the interference be different move towards the null point will cause fringe to move inwards and outwards if move away from it the stage be scan in one direction in interval of a millimetre until it be found that the direction of fringe movement change between -4mm and -3mm the region be scan more slowly with the same green laser and the region be narrow down to a 0.2 mm range from -3.2 to -3.0 mm the laser 's interferogram also spike around this region measurement be take by move the stage quickly back to the position of -3.2mm the region be then scan with the command of -3.08 mm at 0.002 mm/s and 50000 reading to ensure enough be take the gain be reduce on the detector for these source a they have low intensity so this would allow more distinct reading to be take with less background error additional card be also place around the apparatus inside the box to reduce background source the experiment be carry out in a dark laboratory with minimal light to far ensure this caution be take to prevent additional vibration that might have affected reading initially the interferograms be found to be slant upwards this would have be do misalignment a the mirror stage could have not be be perfectly horizontal and cause be get closer therefore reduce ... a ground lens be use with the white lead so that it could be diffuse and appear more uniform a yellow filter be use with the tungsten light 4 the measurement of the spectrum be record by the detector which have a sample rate of 50hz and be move at a speed of 0.002mm/s this meant that the distance between sample be 0.08µm this be input into the fast fourier transform and reconstruct to give the wavelength spectrum a gaussian be plot a an envelop on the interferogram and fit to the wavelength spectrum the fwhm could be found manually from these gaussians to find the coherence length use equation 7. the use of equation 6 then allow the spectral width to be found the mean wavelength be found by zoom in for example a in fig 3 and take an average of the sinusoidal wave produce within the interferogram the combination of all these result then allow the wavelength spread to be found use equation 8. the result obtain via this manual method be all summarise in table i. the error be found to be negligible due to the calcualtions be on the millimetre scale the plot of a gaussian to the wavelength spectrum in fig 5 give a wavelength and standard deviation of 571.9nm and 71.6nm respectively this be not concordant with the manual result found of 522.0nm but it be much closer to the mean value of the visible spectrum which be 560nm so it be accurate both the interferogram and the spectrum do n't appear to exhibit a gaussian distribution exactly this be found mainly to do with how white lead be construct they be often construct with a mix of blue and yellow light which give a white colour that have a distribution across many colour despite this the blue peak be still distinct this mean that the wavelength spectrum appear to have a double peak with one in the blue region and the other in the yellow region the second peak be high than the first which suggests that the lead be quite hot at different temperature the peak shift 5 fig 5. the white lead wavelength spectrum which exhibit a gaussian like shape but not a perfect one a there be an additional peak in the blue region furthermore for a black-body spectrum wien 's displacement law can be apply in which the wavelength when peak intensity occurs varies inversely with temperature spectral radiance be proportional to intensity so this seem appropriate to apply to the wavelength spectrum t λ peak 2.898 × 10 −3 mk this mean that this lead be at a temperature of 5084 k. this seem extremely high and resembles that of a star so the blackbody spectrum be not match by this lead the blue lead give the best fit to a gaussian distribution a show in fig 6 both the interferogram and the wavelength spectrum be gaussian in nature this be because the blue lead can be compose such that it contains only blue light unlike the white light the blue lead fit give a mean wavelength and standard deviation of 462.7nm and 12.0nm respectively this do not agree with the manual method value of 490.4nm however both lie in the accepted value range of 435-500nm an attempt be also make to model this like a black-body this meany the blue lead be at an effective temperature of 6272k which be high compare to the white lead this be justifiable consider the lead get warm the tungsten source have a yellow filter therefore only certain frequency could be obtain in the spectrum and the wavelength spectrum have many spike a fig 9 show a blue lead wavelength spectrum which exhibit a narrower gaussian shape to it interferogram traditionally a filter can be model a a top-hat function which would then be fourier transform into a sinc function which the envelop on fig 8 display 6 fitting a gaussian to the wavelength spectrum give a wavelength and standard deviation of 563.3nm and 15.2nm respectively this only differs from the manual result of 574.0nm found by 2.0 so it be fairly precise it be also accurate a yellow light have an accepted range of 565-590nm the source also all peaked at the same null point highlight the importance of it the gaussian envelop could be fit on all the interferograms allow the parameter in table i to be found despite this it be n't necessarily appropriate for the white lead a the shape have some distortion due to the additional spike at the blue region it be almost a if subtract fig 9. the tungsten with a yellow filter have a wavelegnth spectrum with many spike this be due to the filter cut off certain wavlengths it bares some resemblance to a square top-hat function but it be not perfect a the filter be n't ideal the lead both have accuracy with the method use to calculate their parameter however they lack precision which suggests they may both not necessarily be gaussian there be also limitation to the use of a blackbody spectrum a it may not be directly in thermodynamic equilibrium with it surroundings so the approximation would break down hence why the temperature found be not realistic they be however useful for the comparison of the peak in the white lead spectrum the tungsten filter exhibit the correct shape of a sinc function which result from the filter 7 in conclusion the michelson interferometer prove to be a useful device in study the spectrum of light it allow the wavelength of distribution to be found without deviation from the range of accepted value despite this there be source of error in this which include how truly uniform the sample rate be a there be no guarantee that the reading be take with even distance apart the background intensity be still present despite the effort make to darken the area this would have be due to dark source such a stray electron therefore the experiment could be carry out in a vacuum or gas chamber furthermore the spectrum be found in general to be more conplicated that a guassian so fourier transfroms of other more complex function such a the boltzmann-distribution could have be explore a potential curve fit overall the michelson interferometer be important for explore many physical phenomenon on an atomic scale meaning that this fourier transform spectrometer be vital to study light

17,2ndINT_KSN764_Redacted,an investigation into the spectrum of multiple optical source be undertaken with the use of a fourier transform spectrometer the interferograms record and result spectrum by use of the fourier transform be analyse against both theoretical and manufacturer-provided component specific spectrum both the white lead and tungsten lamp source match the expect spectrum after compensate for wavelength-dependent filter of the detector in addition to this multiple unexpected find in the data be examine and many remain inexplicable without far investigation these include an asymmetry in the white lead interferogram and unexpected structure in the spectrum of the optical filter m ade infamous by the null result of the 1887 michelson-morley experiment 1 the michelson interferometer be a simple yet powerful arrangement of optical component invent by the american physicist albert abraham michelson the michelson interferometer split a light source into two separate beam before recombine them and analyse the interference pattern fig 1. a the interference pattern observe be dependent only on phase difference not on absolute phase they do not vary with time this allows measurement of distance on the order of the wavelength of light ∼ 10 −7 m by change the length of one or both of the arm a michelson interferometer of this type be use by ligo and virgo to successfully detect gravitational wave in 2015 2 however the interferometer can be use for spectrometry by make one of the mirror movable this change the arm length and so change the observe interference the exact mechanism for this be cover in section ii-a this method can have considerable advantage over dispersive method of spectroscopy such a diffraction grate and prism refraction these include the ability to measure all frequency at once and an increase signal to noise ratio from the lack of an aperture an investigation into use this spectrometer to analyse various source be undertaken if the path difference and thus phase difference between the beam be change the result interference pattern will also change it be this property of the interferometer that allows it to be use a an incredibly precise ruler if instead we measure the change in interference pattern for a know path difference the spectrum of the light source can be calculate for a monochromatic but not necessarily coherent source the intensity of the electrical or magnetic component of the signal that reach the detector will be proportional to y 2 such that where k be the wavenumber of the light source x be the position of the detector with increase x towards the beamsplitter ω be the angular frequency of the light source t be the elapse time and φ be the phase difference from the movement of the stage the movable mirror if the stage be to move by a distance d the phase difference φ would become 2kd substitute this and evaluate at x 0 for a static detector give by use of the trigonometric identity this be the form of a travel wave in d within an envelope of co kd for electromagnetic radiation within the visible range ω be of the order 10 15 rad s −1 and so the detector like the eye only measure the envelope note that a dielectric plate in the setup add a half wavelength phase change make the envelope sinusoidal rather than co-sinusoidal 2 polychromatic source when the source be compose of multiple frequency of light fig 2 the envelope combine and form beating pattern give by where k 1 and k 2 be the wavenumbers of the two frequency like any beating pattern this give an envelope with wavenumber k 1 − k 2 and interior oscillation of wavenumber a the stage be move over the measurement range the result interferogram be therefore a combination of these sinusoidal envelope it can therefore be see that the interferogram be proportional to the fourier transform of the spectrum of the source whence it alternative name arises however this be not the waveform of the light produce by the source despite these both be fourier transforms of the same spectrum an incoherent source will still produce an interferogram with finite coherence length consider mount a coherent monochromatic source on the stage and measure the light emit directly with a detector although the stage can move distance a fraction of the wavelength of the source light a realistic detector would still record a constant value for all stage position due to the speed of the oscillation and propagation of the light an optical filter be a device which reduces certain frequency of light pas through it accord to give characteristic although some filter effect be intentional e.g to modify the spectrum of a source unintended filter effect be also present the main source of unintended filter arises from the detector fig 3. data collect will therefore be significantly skewed if wavelength vary over a range of more than ∼ 100 nm or lie particularly far from ∼ 800 nm the apparatus be first construct a in fig 1. the distance between the component and the detector be minimise to reduce any effect of mis-alignment in the setup this improve the accuracy of the reading by minimise the effect of the recombine beam not be parallel to align the setup the green laser be use a a source since it be effectively monochromatic this mean it interferogram have a large coherence length allow interference to be observe far from the null point the detector be replace by a paper board and the position of the mirror and beamsplitter be adjust until all of the observable point of light overlap entirely dim point of light where the beam have be internally reflect one or more time between component be also move to the same position a in a perfectly orthogonal system these would not be visible after alignment a short focal length lens be use to expand the source make interference pattern more visible and maximise coverage of the mirror the stage 's position be then adjust until the interference pattern grow large and the direction of fringe motion with stage displacement flip over a give interval a white lead be then use to scan over this same interval until `` rainbow `` like fringe be observe fig 4 mark the null point due to it broad spectrum the white lead interferogram have a very short coherence length and so precise measurement of the null point be possible the spectrum of a tungsten lamp be expect to follow a black-body thermal emission curve from this we expect the interferogram to be smooth and without beating pattern which be observe fig 5. take the fourier transform of this interferogram we see that the spectrum be smooth and bell shape it also peak at around 900 nm a expect from the manufacturer 's spectrum of the source fig 7. however a a black-body curve it would be expect to be strongly positively skewed whereas fig 6 show no significant skew this be confirm by fig 7. this be due to filter by the detector a outline in section 11-b from fig 3 the maximum sensitivity of the detector occurs at around 930 ± 20 nm with strong negative skew therefore the product of the source spectrum and the filter be go to have little skew and a peak at around 900 nm a observe in fig 6. noteworthy be the smoothness of the record spectrum since accord to fig 7 there should be more structure present this be most likely due to the speed of the stage be too high and so too few data point be collect a white and a blue lead be investigate a source and their interferograms fig 9 and fig 10 respectively show with venow flrter fig 6. a fourier transfonn of the interferograms of a tungsten source with green yellow and no filler -- -- -- -- -- -- -- smooth envelope with little to no beating a expect from the smoothness of fig 8. interferograms of the white lead with green and yellow filter be also take fig 11 yellow omit due to similarity unexpectedly both of these interferograms clearly show beating from fig 8 and the spectral transmission form of the green filter fig 13 the result spectrum would be expect to be a smooth bell shape without any beating the same applies to the yellow filter for far analysis see section iv-c. fourier transform these four interferograms and combine them for comparison fig 12 the general form of the white lead be see to match that of fig 8. however the relative intensity of the narrow and broad peak be different this can be explain by the filter of the detector fig 3 with the shorter wavelength peak be attenuate more than the longer wavelength peak although less insight can be attain from the blue lead spectrum it show a similar form to the shorter wavelength peak of the white lead but with the centre shift to the longer wavelength of 460 ± 10 nm that of blue light this be what might be expect of a source operating by the same physical principal a the white lead the white lead interferogram fig 9 contains a significant asymmetry since an interferogram be make up of only sinusoidal function this structure can not occur in ideal fourier transform interferometer initial hypothesis be the alignment of the setup the direction of stage movement and the structure in the source to investigate the alignment hypothesis the setup be realign and then another interferogram record of the white lead this have a negligible effect the direction of stage movement also have little effect to investigate possible asymmetry in the lead a ground glass filter be place in front of the source and the source be move back by 5 cm this have little effect upon closer inspection of the source structure small bright patch w avelength nm fig 13. the manufacturer 's transmission percentage of the green filter 7 the yellow filter be of the same form that be not radially symmetrical be found see appendix a. to corroborate this the same interferogram be take four time each time rotate the lead by 90 • this also have no effect our remain hypothesis be that this arises either from internal reflection within the setup or from the translationwise position of the lead apply the green and yellow filter to both the tungsten and white lead source it become apparent that both filter on both light source produce spectrum of the same form but shift to their appropriate wavelength compare all four of these spectrum fig 14 it can be see that they all exhibit the same general form four main peak with the long wavelength peak be round despite the suppose transmission characteristic of the filter fig 13. although this explains the beating pattern see in all four interferograms for example fig 11 the reason for these peak be unknown since it be present in all four spectrum it be likely to be due to the way the filter operate or be construct the centre of the four spectrum be found to correspond to their expect value closely the investigation into the fourier transform spectrometer provide insight into the characteristic of the various source use but also raise multiple unknown the tungsten source spectrum be found to be a expect once the frequency dependence of the detector sensitivity be account for however the reason for the smoothness of what should be a jagged spectrum be currently not fully understood the lead spectrum be also found to match the predict form once accounting for the detector sensitivity despite this the cause of the asymmetry in the interferogram could not be found even after extensive investigation the filter source also produce spectrum that be both unexpected and inexplicable however their central wavelength closely match those which be predict all thing consider the investigation verify many characteristic of the source use whilst provide a platform to perform far investigation into unexpected area if it be to be

15,2ndINT_KUY555_Redacted,we use a michelson interferometer to conduct a spectral analysis of light source use a fourier transform method for the monochromatic laser diode the interferogram be use to directly calculate the wavelength a λ 530 ± 50 nm a similar analysis be apply to a white lead source whereby the fourier transform method produce a wavelength spectrum with two peak correspond to λ 460 ± 3 nm and λ 580 ± 8 nm an adjustment due to the photodiode sensitivity be apply and the result wavelength spectrum closely match the expect spectrum for the white lead i nterferometry be a powerful technique in which a beam of light be split and then superimpose with a phase difference to produce an interference pattern the pattern can be analyse to deduce the property of light i.e wavelength in the initial beam interferometry have be responsible for fundamental scientific breakthrough such a disprove the luminiferous aether theory with the michelson-morley experiment 1 and the discovery of gravitational wave with sensitive laser interferometer 2 the technique be also use with spectroscopy to analyse the composition of light wave from unknown source this method be prefer over spectroscopy with diffraction grate because the property of all wavelength of light be encode within the interferogram a fourier transform technique be use to decompose the interferogram into the frequency of light which produce the observe interference pattern we aim to use a fourier transform method with a michelson interferometer to conduct spectral analysis of the light emit by different source the technique can be extend to analyse emission spectrum of other atom similarly analysis of the solar spectrum can be use to resolve the element present in the photosphere a michelson interferometer fig 1 involves the use of a beam-splitter to divide a ray of light into two orthogonal ray one ray be direct towards a fix mirror while the other travel towards a mirror on a stage whose movement be control by powerful magnet the ray be reflect by the mirror to the beam-splitter where they be recombine use the superposition principle and direct towards the photodetector consider monochromatic light of wave vector k and amplitude 2a k incident on the beam-splitter if the mirror be align at the zero path difference point zpd the ray will fig 1 a michelson interferometer split a beam of light into two orthogonal ray one ray be reflect by a fix mirror while the other ray be reflect by a mirror on a move stage the beam be recombine at the beam-splitter and direct to the photodetector 3 constructively interfere then if the mirror be move a distance δx the path difference be 2δx and the recombine wave be ψ a k e i kx−ωt e i kx+2kδx−ωt the resultant intensity at the photodetector can be write a where this expression consists of a constant term i k and an oscillatory term i k co 2kδx if the light source consists of light of vary wave vector k 2πσ where σ be the wavenumber then the resultant intensity at each path difference i δx be an integral over the intensity of each of these wavenumbers 4 which can be write a the fourier cosine transform of i σ see appendix a hence the intensity a a function of path difference i δx be a fourier transform pair of the intensity a a function of wavenumber i σ then by measure the intensity with respect to path difference the intensity with respect to wavenumber can be deduce by take a fourier transform of the interferogram in our experiment we use a magnet-controlled stage to accurately move the mirror and measure the intensity of the resultant beam use an osram sfh 2200 photodiode fig 2 the beam-splitter be align perpendicular to the mirror by verify a single point be visible on the screen in a an incorrectly tilt mirror produce two spot in b a correctly tilt mirror produce a single spot 3 detector the alignment of the apparatus be conduct use a thorlabs collimate laser diode the motorise mirror be reset to it centre position and the beam-splitter be align perpendicular to the normal of the mirror by ensure the reflect beam produce a single point see fig 2 similarly the stage be move through it complete range to verify that there be no vertical tilt in the mirror or beam-splitter the distance from the beam-splitter to the mirror be measure and the fix mirror be position at the same distance exactly opposite the beam-splitter see fig 1 each mirror be individually align accord to the above procedure once the mirror be align a lens be use to enlarge the point on the screen and observe the fizeau interference pattern by vary the tilt of the fix mirror the angle of the mirror be fine-tuned until circular fringe haidinger fringe be observe indicate the tilt alignment be such that circular symmetry be achieve 5 after alignment be complete the laser be replace by a white lead which have a coherence length of 10 µm 5 give that the detector operates at 50 hz the maximum distance that the stage can move per second to detect the interference peak at zpd be approximately where ∆l c be the coherence length and d ≤ 0.1 mm for the white lead to ensure the peak be capture the initial scan be take at v 0.025 mm s −1 within a range of −5 mm to 5 mm which be sufficient to find the zpd we use a computer model to simulate the interferograms we expect to collect firstly for a source with a wavelength of λ 550 nm and line width ∆λ 0.01 nm the observe intensity against path difference be plot in fig 3. note that the wavelength of the plot in fig 3 b be λ 550 ± 10 nm which corresponds to the simulated wavelength similar analysis can be extend to a source of white light which will contain multiple wavelength of visible light we can simulate this a a source with wavelength λ 550 nm and a spectral width of ∆λ 150 nm the plot of intensity against path difference be show in fig 4. we use the green collimate laser diode to produce an interferogram a show in fig 5. the interferogram be conduct over a short range so the modulate gaussian shape be not completely developed and therefore the width of the envelope can not be calculate however the individual cosine oscillation can be resolve if the axis be scale appropriately fig 5 b note that this be a plot of intensity against the fig 4 a plot of the intensity in arbitrary unit against path difference for white light show a cosinusoid function which be modulate by a gaussian of width σ 0.38 ± 0.08 µm position of the mirror x rather than the path difference δx so we account for the factor of two in the fourier transform analysis when the fourier transform of fig 5 be take and the unit be convert from wavenumber to wavelength a plot of amplitude in arbitrary unit against wavelength be produce in fig 6. this appear to show an almost rectangular function in the range 500 nm to 575 nm with some strong noise the shape of the modulate gaussian be not clear so the fourier transform be not able to deduce the width of the correspond gaussian pair in wavenumber space the standard approach would be to take a long interferogram to resolve the width of the modulate gaussian but since the light from the laser be monochromatic it be possible to deduce the wavelength directly from the interferogram a with the simulated data in fig 3. to determine the wavelength of the sinusoid in the interferogram we take an average of the separation between peak the interferogram be noisy and some data point be cluster due to instability in the move stage so analyse this data directly cause some point to be incorrectly identify a peak which can skew the result instead we calculate a linear move average of the data in a fix window of five data point this smooth the curve and behaves a a noise filter we can verify that apply the filter have improve the quality of the data by consider the histogram of the distance the mirror must move between peak in fig 7. note that the wavelength be twice the distance move by the mirror between peak thus use the filter interferogram we calculate the wavelength of the light source a λ 530 ± 50 nm the expect value from the data sheet be λ 532.0 ± 0.6 nm 7 there be a large error in the calculate wavelength due to the spread in the value for peak separation which arises from inaccuracy in the move stage we repeat the step for the white lead source produce a wide interferogram about the zpd see fig 8 unlike the fig 5 a plot of the intensity in arbitrary unit against position of the mirror in millimetre for a green laser show a an interferogram which we anticipate would take the shape of a modulate gaussian if the range of the mirror be extend in b the axis be scale to show the individual sinusoid that compose the interferogram fig 6 the laser interferogram be fourier transform to wavenumber space and then the axis be scale to produce an amplitude against wavelength plot the plot appear to show a rectangular function between from 500 nm to 575 nm with noise in the centre which be likely due to the shape of the gaussian not develop in the correspond interferogram simulated interferogram in fig 4 the actual interferogram have many more oscillation this indicates that the white lead do not output a symmetric gaussian distribution of wavelength a assume in the simulation the asymmetry in the interferogram be an indication that there be some misalignment of apparatus but the general shape of the interferogram be unaffected in fig 9 we fourier transform the interferogram to wavenumber space and scale the axis to produce a graph of amplitude in arbitrary unit against wavelength the plot show two distinct gaussians overlap a gaussian with mean µ 460 ± 3 nm and standard deviation σ 10 ± 5 nm and another gaussian with mean µ 580 ± 8 nm and standard deviation σ 60 ± 10 nm one critical source of error in the experiment be the sensitivity of the photodiode detector to certain wavelength of light from the technical datasheet the photodiode be most suit to detect wavelength in the region 800 nm to 1000 nm see fig 10 for a give λ in nanometre we can model the fig 8 a plot of intensity in arbitrary unit against the distance move by the mirror produce an interferogram which appear to show cosinusoid function modulate by some decay function note that the left side of the interferogram appear to be asymmetrical but the general shape of the interferogram should provide sufficient information for fourier analysis fig 9 a fourier transform of the white lead interferogram can be use to resolve the wavelength in this light source the lead contains two distinct gaussian function the gaussian at λ 460 ± 3 nm be approximately 80 of the amplitude of the gaussian at λ 580 ± 8 nm which be significantly wider sensitivity of the photodiode use a piecewise linear function then we divide the amplitude of the observe wavelength in fig 9 by the correspond relative sensitivity of the photodiode for each give wavelength the result be a plot of the adjust amplitude of each wavelength in the interferogram a show in fig 11 a note that this be almost identical to the resultant wavelength characteristic graph show with the black line in fig 11 b fig 10 the relative sensitivity of the photodiode a a function of the wavelength of incident light the photodiode be optimise for detect wavelength in the range 800 nm to 1000 nm so be not ideal for analysis of visible spectrum 8 a persistent source of error in this experiment be the motorise stage there be a systematic error in the way that the motorise stage move when specify to move at a constant velocity if the velocity be too low the stage do not move linearly but instead jumped between position and then cluster it data point until it move onto the next position this be apparent when the interferogram be analyse at a high resolution a fig 12. there be also a random error in the value measure a the current position by the stage a histogram of the distance move by the stage between measurement reveals that in the above case the stage move an average distance of ∆x 1.7 nm per sample but with a standard deviation of σ 117 nm with oscillation a far backwards a ∆x 160 nm between measurement the combine random and systematic error in the movement of the stage contributes the large error in the measure interferograms and hence in the observe wavelength the inadequacy of the photodetector in detect visible light have already be discus but the correspond effect have not be explore the sensitivity of the photodiode increase proportionally to λ for the range 400 nm to 920 nm fig 11 in a the adjust amplitude for each wavelength show that the wavelength correspond to blue light be the most prevalent in the white lead follow by a wider mix of wavelength in the 500 nm to 650 nm range in b a white lead operating at temperature 25 • c consists of four gaussian peak with light emission at 470 ± 4 nm 500 ± 4 nm 550 ± 4 nm and 633 ± 4 nm correspond to blue cyan green and red respectively the resultant characteristic show in black have peak emission around λ 442 ± 4 nm and a small peak at λ 529 ± 4 nm 8 thus if a light source have a characteristic emission spectrum such that the amplitude of light emit decrease a ∝ λ −1 in the same range then the combine effect can result in the photodiode detect an interferogram which be the fourier transform of a rectangular function i.e a sinc function it 's possible that this effect contributes to the modulate envelope in fig 8. a photodiode which be exclusively sensitive to wavelength in the visible spectrum would be more suitable for this experiment we have use the michelson interferometer with a fourier transform technique to conduct a spectral analysis of light from different source use simulated interferograms we fig 12 the movement of the stage be not linear so the sample point be not linearly space and can be cluster between some measurement the stage appear to move in the wrong direction the error bar represent an error of ∆x ±10 nm equivalent to 5 time the average distance move per sample a move average filter be apply to this data in fig 7 to reduce the effect of the stage instability predict a monochromatic source would produce a cosinusoidal function modulate by a wide gaussian envelope while a white light source would yield a cosinusoid modulate by a narrow gaussian we measure the wavelength of the green laser directly from the interferogram a λ 530 ± 50 nm which include the expect value of λ 532.0 ± 0.6 nm a fourier transform method could not be use directly on the interferogram a the shape of the modulate gaussian be not developed on the small range use spectral analysis of a white lead show two distinct wavelength peak at λ 460 ± 3 nm and λ 580

35,2ndINT_LUU804_Redacted,the wavelength spectrum and coherence length of three light sources-a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten white-light incandescent source-were measure these measurement be conduct use a michelson interferometer and analyze use fitting both gaussian and sinusoidal plot to the interferograms produce for each source the average wavelength and coherence length be respectively 470 ± 3 nm and 1.20 ± 0.05 mm for the white lead 445.0 ± 0.3 nm and 2.71 ± 0.02 mm for the blue lead and 1116 ± 11 nm and 1.26 ± 0.06 for the tungsten source possible source of error in our measurement include noise due to our error in set up and adjust the equipment and external vibration effect the position of both mirror use the michelson interferometer be a tool developed in 1881 by albert michelson he intend to use it to measure change in the speed of light and resolve a dispute surround the motion of the luminiferous aether the medium through which light be thought to travel 1 these change be never observe despite the experiment be more than accurate enough to measure them there be no theory at the time congruous with this result however in 1905 albert einstein provide a theory of light without the need for any aether neatly explain michelson 's result there be need to explain why the aether be n't move there simply be n't any aether at all 2 the immense accuracy of this result despite it 's experimenter work of an entirely wrong assumption show the potential power of the michelson interferometer a a tool for precise measurement the setup of such an interferometer consists of a light source two mirror a detector and a beamsplitter arrange a in fig 1. light enters the beamsplitter from the source bounce off both mirror return to the beamsplitter and interferes with itself produce a unique pattern of fringe project onto and measure by the detector the adjustable mirror m1 can be use to alter the path difference between the two possible track light can take though the apparatus and so 'scan through the interference pattern produce this tool can be use in different configuration for experiment across optic but in our specific experiment we use a michelson interferometer to measure the wavelength spectrum and coherence length of several different light source namely a white lead a blue lead and a tungsten incandescent source we chose to measure coherence length the distance over which light remains aove a certain level of coherence a it be incredibly important in optical communication it be use in order to quantify the degree of coherence a piece of equipment need in order to measure accurate result and asa guide to the level of alignment need to send data with a reasonable amount of loss 3 the wavelength spectrum of each source be also measure to gain more information about the different light source and understand the work and potential problem with the use of these three different type of source ii theory for any initial intensity spectrum i i σ the displayed spectrum i f x where x be the path difference between the path take by each beam of the light through the interferometer be where and λ be the wavelength of the source 4 5 equation 1 can be compare to the cosine representation of a fourier transform lead to the result hence to obtain the wavelength spectrum of the original source it be possible to simply inverse fourier transform the final displayed spectrum the typical form of i f close to it 's null point where x 0 consists of sinusoidal fringe contain in a gaussian envelope the spectral width δ of the source be closely related to the fwhm of this gaussian envelope through this fwhm be obtain by identify the maximum value of the gaussian then find the difference between the x-values that lead to a y-value of half the maximum the spectral width be link to the coherence length l coh of the source by the simple relation we set up our equipment a in fig 1 guide by our knowledge of the michelson interferometer a photo of our experiment without the light-proof box that surround it to cut out external light be visible a fig 2. we align the interferometer use the green laser a our source and alter the tilt and position of our fix mirror m2 in fig 1 until haldinger circular fringe be visible at the detector 's position we ensure to centre these circular fringe each time we re-aligned the experiment in order to keep our result consistant the green laser be also use to estimate of the position of the adjustable mirror m1 that lead to a zero-path difference between the two possible path through the interferometer and so to the appearance of the null point in our reading the green laser be monochromatic and so it fringe be visible across the range of position possible for m1 this meant that it be possible to take large-scale measurement of the pattern and thus estimate the position of the null point the other source provide be not monochromatic and so the amplitude of their fringe decrease rapidly on either side of the null point until it be impossible to see any fringe outside of an 0.1-mm range surround the null point this make it exceptionally difficult to pinpoint the null point use other source than the green laser without preliminary estimation of it 's position to estimate the position of the null point we first remove the detector from our setup replace it with a piece of plain white card this simplify the process of counting fringe a computational method be not need a the fringe be visible to the naked eye next we move m1 across a wide range of position most typically from -5mm to 5mm take measurement every 1mm to take measurement we first center the fringe pattern onto a small pencil mark on the card then count the number of fringe visible in the pattern move outwards from the centre of the pattern this fringe count would typically dip until it reach a minimum of 1 or 2 fringe and then rise the minimum number of fringe correspond to the null point of the interferometer but a the green laser 's fringe be so wide an accurate measurement be not possible to obtain a more accurate measurement we 'd replace the green laser with whichever of the source we wish to study and take wide measurement about the estimate null point we look for the characteristic behaviour of the source about the true null point where fringe would appear and quickly fade away once we have preliminary data and thus a more accurate value for the position of the null point we would fig 2. this figure be a photograph of our experimental setup show with the green laser in place and power up the lid and two wall of the light-proof box surround our interferometer have be remove to allow the photograph to be take when use more diffuse source such a the white-light lead the dark piece of card would be place to surround the lead and block nay reflection from reach the detector move the mirror slowly across the null point take detailed measurement of the source 's interferogram once we have a detailed interferogram show the behaviour of our chosen source at it 's null point we use computational method to analyse it in two different way to produce a wavelength spectrum first a described in equation 3 we take it 's fourier transform secondly we split the interferomegram into several section fitting each section to a sinusoid a histogram of the wavelength of these sinusoid be take and treat a a wavelength spectrum of the original light source to find the coherence length of the source we analyse the interferogram in a different way fitting it 's overall shape to a gaussian the fwhm of this gaussian could be analyse a in equation 4 and 5 to find the coherence length of the source our result be show in figure 4 6 and 8 a well a table i. the value in table i be the one calculate use a sinusoidal fit to the data to estimate the wavelength instead of rely on the fourier transform of the data a the data collect use the fit be closer to the physical reality of the situation a can be see by compare fig 3 which show an idealise measurement of the spectrum of a white-light lead fig 4b the fourier plot of the wavelength spectrum and fig 4c the histogram of fit wavelength value fig 4b do not show the twin-peak behaviour expect and it 's peak be at a much low wavelength than expect whilst fig 4c show the narrow-to-wide behaviour expect and give a mean wavelength of 470nm between the two 'peaks but weight toward the large peak a expect the data from the blue lead fig 6 show a similar effect fig 5 show an idealise blue lead spectrum contain two peak one at around 460nm and a small one at around 625nm the fourier-analysed data fig 6b do not show any sign of a peak in the 600nm range and instead peak at around 530nm much high than expect with a secondary shallower peak at 470mn this graph do not physically fit with the result we expect the second analysis perform on the data use sinusoidal fit instead of a fourier transform be slightly more in line with the expect result this result show in fig 6c contains a peak at 510nm with a close secondary peak at around 460nm some value be distribute much low at value around 100-300nm but these be vestige of an imperfect fit to the data and so be not physical effect and can be discount the data from the tungsten effervescent source fig 8 seem slightly more accurate the idealise spectrum fig 7 show a very broad peak with it 's maximum value around 1200nm the fourier tranform analytic method result in fig 8b which peak around 470nm extremely low consider the fact that this source be incandescent and so should peak in the uv region of the em spectrum a the idealise spectrum do fortunately the second analytic method use a sinusoidal fit result in fig 8c which peak around 1050nm and even appear to have the same uneven shape a the idealise spectrum with the peak skewed towards the low wavelength we found the coherence length of each of the source by find the fwhm of the interferograms of each source use equation 4 to find the spectral width then substitute into equation 5. our error in coherence length be calculate use the covarience matrix of our gaussian fit to the data other error be estimate due to the inaccuracy we found whilst measure the data we found that the adjustable mirror be inaccurate at speed less that 1 micron per second a the slow motion lead the mirror to wobble lead to a lot of noise in our data and an inability to see the fringe accurately we estimate the power of this effect by perform a set of measurement without move the mirror lead to the result displayed in fig 9. we also observe that the motion of the mirror be extremely susceptible to outside vibration such a our sit down onto our stool at the lab bench beside the apparatus or write in our lab book on the desk that held the apparatus both of these action cause significant spike of noise in our preliminary data and so when take final data we ensures to remain a still a possible in order to avoid the influence of outside vibration on the mirror motion a much a possible we also found it difficult to keep the apparatus in alignment and take meaningful result often when we switch the light source from the green laser use for alignment to a different source the action of unscrew the old source and place the new source into position perturbed the equipment enough to knock the mirror and beam-splitter out of alignment v. summary we perform this experiment with the aim to determine the average wavelength and coherence length for several different light source we achieve this aim measure both value for three separate source compare our result to idealise spectrum for each source our result show a similar wavelength spectrum for each source and any discrepancy can be explain due to problem with the apparatus and with the fit of the sinusoidal curve to the interferometer the value we obtain for the coherence length of each source seem rather high and with rather small error this may be due to the fact that the error use of the coherence length related to the accuracy of the gaussian fit to the data and not the accuracy of the data itself the experiment could be improve by isolate the apparatus from external vibration entirely to eliminate the noise cause by for example walk past the apparatus while measurement be be take this problem could also be address by isolate the apparatus entirely for example in a separate room from the experimenter whilst measurement be be take well result could also have be attain through meticulous attention to the fit of each dataset but in our case time constraint disallowed this possibility,extended,bal,75,0.860884011,0.139115974
16,2ndINT_GOO868_Redacted,"this report will look into a interferometry experiment that we conduct over a 3 week period in order to observe and measure numerous light source wavelength a a result this be a display of the measurement that we take of a white lead blue lead and a white tungsten that have either a green or yellow filter attach to it from this we be able to collect all their respective wavelength by use a fast fourier transformation on the interferogram numerous characteristic of each source could be found a well a the inefficiency within the system the wavelength of these source and their associate error can be found within the data analysis and error calculation section interferometry be the usage of electromagnetic wave in order to allow for a system to produce an interference pattern that will allow for small displacement to be measure a well a for the study of a material 's property the experiment that we be conduct look into both of these area for the experiment that we be able to complete we be able to take an interferogram of our source and through fourier analysis we be able to find the individual wavelength of the source often best show through a gausssian distribution in addition these gaussians also allow for data to be collect about the information of the system and it imperfection this setup that we be able to use through the usage of both qualitative and quantitative data allow measurement into the wavelength of the source spectral width step size and coherence length each of which explain in the follow section the setup that we will consider be the same configuration a the michelson interferometer 1 and can be see in figure 1. from this figure it 's able to show the principal setup and the influence of misalignment if the setup be to be correctly align the two mirror should produce haidinger fringe and hence interference that produce a circular pattern if incorrectly align the system will produce fizeau horizontal fringe both of these case be a result of interference from the two image produce by the mirror after the beam-splitter separate the source 's signal the interference within the system allows for information to be record however the point which be of most concern for our experiment be the null point in order to define the null point first consider figure 2 show the path a ray would take when incident on the two mirror and how the two image from the mirror overlay one another 1. this be a diagram of the michelson interferometer setup the same setup we use for our experiment and with a move mirror 2 on a table drive by a motor 2 the use of figure 2 can allow the triangle abc to be consider a a result of this triangle the equation for the relation between separation of the mirror t and the wavelength of the source λ can be found where θ the angle between the normal of the mirror and the ray and m be the order of the wavelength that allow for this particular separation and angle this equation aid in the definition of the null point and this be where t=0 the null point qualitatively however when observe be through the movement of the fringe on either side of the null point the circular fringe move in opposite direction and hence the fringe can be to be move outwards and inwards on either side of the null point provide the secondary mirror be move and thus allow u to find the null point 's position a a result of this a number of simulation can be take to predict this behaviour show in figure 3,4 and 5. figure 3 be the expect inteferogram for white light with a wider beam and a can be see be it narrow nature and this be also explain through fourier analysis due to the fourier transforms the wider the frequency range the shorter transform and hence a narrow interferogram for white light figure 4 be in regard to a multitude of different wavelength and in this case 4 wavelength these wavelength show in figure 5 represent their respective intensity to form this pattern however the practical application of this data raise an important concept the coherence length of the signal be the distance over which an electromagnetic signal will retain the characteristic of a coherent signal this be also define through the degree of coherence with the first degree of coherence be related to it amplitude and the second degree of coherence in relation to intensity this report be in regard to the first degree of coherence 3 however an important concept behind the fourier transforms act upon the interferogram be the nyquist theorem this theorem show that in order for all the information to be correctly interpret from a signal the band limit must be great than half the sample frequency this be best show through figure 6 which be a visual representation of how the same raw signal may produce an incorrect transformation due to the sample rate this incorrect signal be aliasing 4 fig 6. this be a visual representation of the nyquist theorem 's result the observation that we will make will also be look into whether the source exhibit a black body behaviour and this be show in planck 's law this be represent a a continuous frequency spectrum that be dependent upon a source 's temperature and a a result this should also be see from our wavelength fourier transform in addition we will consider wien 's displacement law which be represent a where b be represent the wien 's displacement constant λ max be the wavelength with the great intensity amplitude and t represent the temperature of the source be consider 1 the setup that we follow be the same a that in figure 1. in order to use this setup we have to follow certain procedure in order to ensure that the mirror be correctly align to align the mirror we first have to ensure that each of the surface be clean and that any imperfection should be take away use isopropanol on the mirror and lens the height of each part of the setup be already correctly setup and with the motor for mirror 2 already set into place the rest of the setup be orientate around it position the mirror be place perpendicular to each other and a metal arm for the beamsplitter be place in the direction of the detector we also place a lens with a 100 mm focal length to focus the light of the green laser we use for alignment we would then adjust the setup accordingly to ensure that light be hit the centre of mirror 1 and 2. we then adjust mirror 1 accordingly to ensure they would align and for the the light to interfere to ensure that laser be align perfectly we would use the side wall of the entire setup to use a large distance so that any misalignment could be more easily see from this you should be able to see the haidinger fringe after see the haidinger fringe we then move onto find the null point and this be achieve through a method of interval bisection we first move to the maximum displacement of each end of the motor movement to record the direction of the fringe to see whether they be move inwards or outwards we would then move to 0 mm and then depend upon the movement of the fringe we then half the range we be look into through this method we be able to achieve a range of 0.2-0.3 mm for the null point and this be large than we have do in previous attempt because in prior attempt when move onto other source the null point may have move due to the human error of replace equipment and hence minor adjustment to the setup in order to record data we have to use a linux o and this be very different to the prior o we have be in contact with nonetheless in order to record data the detector be connect to the computer via a usb to account for the flow of data collection we have to provide a command for 'usb low latency within a terminal window for the data collection we would then use the 'take data command which be proceed by 3 number represent the point mirror 2 should move to it speed and the number of sample take this data be record into an output data file locate on the desktop and upon the end of sample this data have to be save each time to avoid lose the data since a new set of reading would go over the top of the reading previously record this data would then be uploaded into the simple fit 2.py file and then from there the dsamp have to be adjust the adjustment be need to account for the speed of the motor the sample rate of the detector ran that ran at a rate of 50hz and that the distance move by the arm would have to be double due to signal travel both to the mirror and back to the beamsplitter a a result we then move onto record our data first we use the white lead follow by the blue lead and white tungsten source with either a green or yellow filter for the lead we remove the lens and put in a ground glass diffuser and also place more black card between each part of the setup to ensure no light from other aspect of the setup would cause far interference for each of these source we chose between speed of 0.0001 and 0.002 mm/s depend on which record and we would move over an area of 0.2-0.3 mm in the range over -3.1mm and -2.8mm for mirror 2. the signal that we would see on the visual representation of the live data collection approximately look like a sine wave and then approach the null point the signal should become clearer with a much great amplitude the visual qualitative data of each source would sometimes aid in location for example with white light there should be a rainbow on either side of the null point and at the null point it should black and white these data file be then put into the simple fit 2 file on the spyder platform and from this 3 figure be produce the raw data inteferogram oscillation per sample against amplitude and then the wavelength against amplitude the last of these figure be form from the fourier transform the methodology for the data calculation that i undertook be to take a fft fast-fourier transform of the interferogram and from this gain a gaussian distribution for the wavelength since this be a first order of coherence be consider the amplitude graph will only be consider when put against the wavelength a a result the raw data will not be show however the final data plot shall be give for each with analysis follow therefore in figure 7 the final wavelength for the white lead can be found fig 7. this be the plot of the wavelength distribution for the white lead from this data it can be see there be a gaussian distribution for the white light however what 's also noticeable be the two peak within the data these two peak be due to the temperature of the lead 4 where if a cooler lead be use the left peak would be much great this be also the expect range because it be able to cover the entirety of the visible wavelength thus correspond to a white light the value in figure 8 show the gaussian fit for the blue lead and this be also near the expect value for the blue lead which be in the range of 450-475nm 5 on the other hand the peak should correspond to a delta function since we be assume the source to be of a constant wavelength the error in the plot can also correspond to the error in the step size of the motor for mirror 2 and thus show in table 1 's data and correspond to the ∆λ this should correspond to one single wave-packet and hence one wavelength and therefore a dirac delta function however this be not what be see and hence the error in the value corresponds to the error in the step size this source produce a lot more noise in the signal and this can be attribute to the nature of the source and it relative instability compare to the lead the use of the filter however be important when regard this distribution a can be see in figure 10 for the other filter use in figure 10 it be able to show the nature of the yellow filter with the green light of the tungsten the two clear peak in the wavelength distribution show the inadequacy of the gaussian fit for the entirety of this region however also when look at the raw data it be similar to that of the sinc function which be the fourier transformation of the top hat function and hence this be also able to show the behaviour of the filter and it functionality for the different wavelength and how they interact 4 overall however the data can be show in the follow table for the data of our source the equation use for these calculation can be work backwards from the error in the gaussian of the wavelength distribution they can be show in the follow two equation where l be the coherence length ∆v be the spectral width and c be the speed of light for these calculation therefore by approximate the σ in the wavelength gaussian a ∆λ all calculation can be make 1 the value of t be calculate use wien 's displacement law and this be under the assumption each source be act a a black body however this ca n't be infer from the graph due to the lack of the correct shape over their respective region this be because they do not have their slight offset in the correct direction and with the presence off too much noise this assumption can not be make however other conclusion could be make from the data for example the variation in the coherence length of the source and a expect white have the shortest coherence length and this can be held accountable to the variation in the spectral width since white light cover a much large range of frequency our experiment be base upon the idea of a michelson interferometer and we be able to retrieve the wavelength of a multitude of different source and from this also collect information about the spectral width of the source also we be also able to observe the behaviour of the filter that be be use within the experiment however if we be to redo this experiment it would be to have adjust the setup such that noise could be remove for example the reduction of light impact the setup we would also have look into the distribution of the noise and the influence of temperature more greatly also the vibration influence the movement of the detector and hence the measurement overall i believe that we be able to achieve the goal of the experiment and that with these experiment it would have be easy to see the behaviour that we be expect from the theory",deep,bal,70,0.861864686,0.138135344

a michelson interferometer be use to interfere light from a source with itself over a vary path difference create an interferogram the interferograms be then analyse to produce an emission spectrum of the source by fourier transform the spatial interferogram into wavelength space this technique differs from dispersion spectroscopy where the fourier transform be effectively perform physically by the diffraction element ft be valuable in physic astronomy and chemistry a an accurate spectroscopy technique with a high resolve power 1 the michelson interferometer make famous from the 1887 michelson-morley experiment which first provide evidence for the nonexistence of the so-called luminiferous ether 2 u a coherent source and a path difference to create an interference pattern a illustrate in 1 an incident beam can be pas through a beam splitter into two beam travel separate path these beam be then reflect and recombine in the splitter to create a new beam by vary the length of one of the path or 'arms with a mobile mirror label 5 in figure 1 you can create a path difference and hence phase difference between the two beam this phase difference cause an interference pattern which can be observe on a screen or by a detector a motorise stage be use to control the velocity of the mirror the range over which it move and the number of data sample take the fringe show in 2 be the result of a monochromatic laser beam in a well-aligned michelson interferometer the concentric circular fringe occur a the path difference of the light varies radially within the cross-section of the light beam perpendicular to the direction of travel the interferograms produce by the michelson interferometer depend on the frequency of light present in the source use a computer to perform a fourier transform on the interferograms produce a spectrum in frequency space a fast fourier transform fft be use from the python scipy.fftpack package to perform quick discrete fourier transforms on our bulk set of data the discrete fourier transform dft be give by where x n x 0 x 1 ... x n −1 be a signal in configuration space compose of n number and x x k 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 be

power spectrum in frequency space which can be convert to wavelength space a a continuous fourier transform change the domain of a function over a continuous interval a dft performs the same function for discrete datasets with small evenly-spaced separation this make it easy to be perform by a computer and the fft employ an algorithm which reduces the processing time of a dft such that execution time scale a ∼ n log n a oppose to n 2 for a regular dft calculation give that the mirror move at a fix speed and sample rate for all data set the assumption that the separation between data point take be small compare to the total range of movement and even be take to be true in iv the fourier transforms perform be on wavepackets that follow a gaussian form or similar by take the transform into wavelength space of a gaussian you create another gaussian with related property where λ be wavelength the transform domain σ be the width of the configuration space gaussian and ρ be the width of the wavelength space gaussian and it can be show that ρ 1 σ this implies that a wide interferogram wavepacket will produce a narrow spectral distribution and vice versa this effect will be observable on the spectrum present in later section the first objective of the investigation be to locate the null point of the apparatus the null point be the point of zero path difference between the beam and occurs when the length of the arm of the interferometer be identical because of this it be around the null point where the interence pattern intensity be great and so it be essential to know this point in order to produce interferograms quickly and easily a per the instruction in 4 the interferometer be construct such that the distance between the splitter and each mirror be measurably similar within a few millimeter a green laser with an expand lens be then use a the light source such that clear haidinger fringe be produce such a those in 2. the stage be translate to an arbitrary start location and then move through a small displacement in the positive direction such that the fringe could be observe to be travel radially outwards or inwards a property of the null point be that the direction of movement of the fringe switch around it furthermore the closer the stage be to the nullpoint the wider the observe fringe be so few be visible in a fix area hence by move the stage to different location and note the direction of motion of the fringe a well a the fringe size a quick binary-style search can be perform to find the range that contains the null point an example of this search be give in table i -the table show a convergence on the null point to a 0.1 mm interval between −5.9 mm and −6.0 mm at this interval the expand laser be no longer appropriate for find the source a the fringe become too big to tell what direction they be move in a white lead be use instead a our simulation show that it interferogram would be null everywhere expect at distance very close to the null point see a the width of the distribution of wavelength in the light from the white lead be very large 5 and cover the visible spectrum which a mention in ii-b corresponds to a narrow interferogram hence the null point could be localise quickly use this source the interval determine in i be scan through through iterative narrow down of the interval contain the null point eventually a detailed interferogram could be take the number of sample to be take and the distance move by the mirror be configure so that the distance between sample be 20 nm which be the small resolvable distance the stage be capable of move in prior experimentation with the apparatus it be found that if the distance between sample be less than this then the data become erratic furthermore if the small distance move be less than the small resolvable distance of the stage then one can not consider the individual measurement of distance reliable use the interferogram obtain it be possible to analytically determine the null point the interferogram have a non-zero background signal which be determine use numpy.mean and subtract from the signal data this be to make the code to fit the data easy the background adjust interferogram for the white lead be show in 3. the interferogram be symmetrical in the distance axis so only one half of the data need to be fit in order to find the position of the peak therefore the absolute value of signal be plot against position and be found to fit a gaussian distribution sufficiently well use the scipy.optimize.curve_fit function the parameter for the mean and standard deviation be optimise and the result fit be show in 4. the parameter return determine the null point to be at −5.89644 ± 0.00001 mm the same process be repeat for three more datasets include two of the blue lead to include the effect of the distribution type on the fit parameter the mean value of the null point with standard deviation be then determine a −5.8963 ± 0.0001 mm this value be not consistent with the result of the binary search from table i. this be because a fine alignment alteration be make between the green laser and the white lead that change the null point very slightly such that it be easy to find without repeat the binary search by extend the scan interval this null point value be use to centre all the interferograms produce from other light source the thorlabs sls201l be use a a light source for this investigation without a filter apply the lamp act a a white light source a it be approximately a black body radiator 6 and compare to the white lead be less intense and visibly more orange in light our spectrum in 5 support this observation a it show a large bandwidth fwhm 310±2 nm that cover most of the visible light spectrum imply white light but have very low intensity at the blue wavelength of light ∼ 450nm the graph also show high intensity outside of visible light and the central wavelength λ 871.9 ± 0.8 nm be in infrared from 5 the gaussian be not a perfect fit due to the shape of the distribution and this make our cite λ an estimate the uncertainty give be produce by the fit package but be an underestimate a black body emission would be a well fit and be provide in the documentation for the lamp 6 the tungsten lamp be use in conjunction with the fl543.5-10 green filter in the setup from ii-a the interferogram obtain however have the feature of an uneven background level this shift in background intensity could have be due to a slight misalignment in the apparatus such a the adjustable fix mirror be slightly realign this would change the centre of the interference pattern on the detector and could cause a gradient in intensity a the path difference change in order to counter this a linear fit be make in python to characterise the vary background slope and this be then subtract from the data to rectify it result in the improve interferogram in 7. it be worth note that the background do not affect the fourier transform of the data a the spectrum only depends on the frequency of the light and not their absolute position the result interferogram be then fourier transform use the package delineate in ii-b to produce an emission spectrum figure 8 which be analyse figure 8 show that the gaussian do not perfectly fit the data but give a good approximation of the mean and width of the spectral distribution the mean wavelength obtain from the fit parameter be 539.5 ± 0.6 nm with an fwhm of 82 ± 1 nm the fwhm full width half maximum be a width measurement calculate from the standard deviation parameter sigma optimise during the gaussian fit use the formula f w hm 2 2 log 2σ from the thorlabs specification for the filter 7 the central wavelength λ 543.5±2 nm with an fwhm of 10±2 nm be quote which do not include the obtain value of either central wavelength or width in it tolerance the estimate wavelength carry an error of 0.74 which be small but not negligible give the precision of the apparatus use and the magnitude of the distance the experiment operate over it be likely that the error on the central wavelength give by the fit parameter of the gaussian be an underestimate a there be a large spread around the peak of the curve if a well fit function be found that yield a more representative uncertainty then the experimental value for λ could include the manufacturer 's wavelength the fwhm found from the fit have 720 error compare to the value quote in 7 which be a significant spectral broadening this spectral broadening could be due to the unreliability in the movement of the stage at small distance which would cause it to move by large amount than the calculate distance between sample thus cause a spread in the signal pattern when look directly at the signal and distance data generate from the detector the distance interval between measurement be not regular and can vary by up to an order of magnitude some consecutive measurement have position difference of only a few nanometre whereas some have difference great than the 20 nm calculate separation this give credit to the idea that the stage 's movement at small distance be not reliable even though the data look smoother when compare to data take from run where the number of sample lead to a calculate measurement separation of less than 20 nm this creates problem a an even separation between data point be one of the assumption that validate the use of a dft and hence the fft use to calculate the spectrum since this condition have be violate it be reasonable to suggest that the broadening of the spectral peak could be due to effect create by the fft -by use a calculate data point separation in the fft when the actual separation of value be irregular the spectrum could easily have be broaden by cast value for signal to incorrect wavelength value the interferogram produce by the tungstgen lamp with a yellow filter do not require an alteration for linear background intensity which support the idea that the change in intensity type be due to a misalignment before take the data for the green filter a the green filter be the last experiment to be execute the spectrum from the yellow filter interferogram be show in 9. the value λ 575.9 ± 0.8 nm and fwhm 88 ± 2 nm be obtain from the fit in 9. the central wavelength have an error of 0.71 on the manufacturer 's value also found in 7 and the fwhm have a 780 error these discrepancy be consistent with those in iv-a which corroborate the explanation make a it give evidence that the data set for the green filter be not unique compare figure 8 and 9 the distribution be similar -9 also show a large spread of data nearer the peak which would imply a large uncertainty on the peak wavelength than give by the fit parameter at the base of the distribution it be also visible that the gaussian overshoot the data which implies the fwhm might be overestimate by the fit parameter albeit not by an amount that would reduce it to the value give by the manufacturer look closely at the data point the spread at the top of the distribution look like a double peak this be not mention anywhere in the manufacturer 's documentation and there be no physical reason that could be determine for their to be two peak wavelength let through by the filter and so only one peak be fit it be possible that the appearance of this double peak be due to the stage movement and fft issue discus in iv-a this experiment have demonstrate the power of fourier transform spectroscopy to utilise simple interferometry principle and computational method to analyse light source in detail with good result for the wavelength of spectrum yield error of 0.74 and 0.71 on wavelength of the green and yellow light source respectively however there be a clear spectral broadening effect apparent in the result see in the experiment with the monochromatic distribution appear ∼ 7.5 time a wide a expect this have be attribute to the motorise stage use in the experiment after inspection of the raw data and consideration of the analysis technique use this do not discredit the technique a a whole which could produce precise and accurate result with the correct equipment an interest comparison would be to test a different stage and see if the broadening be reduce but this be beyond the scope of the experiment the interferogram of a white light source be simulated and produce 10. at large scale this distribution look simply like a vertical spike in a zero-signal which make it easy to locate when scan though large range hence why the white lead be use the null point itself be locate at the origin on the diagram which corresponds to the point at the peak of the signal envelope by model the signal a a gaussian packet the mean position can be found and the null point determine,deep,exp,65,0.882916927,0.11708311

detect at incremental distance from this point we will perform fast fourier transforms fft with a computer on our data to study the amplitude of the light source in wavelength space this will give u a spectrum of the light within the source we will approximate gaussian function to the envelope of the interferograms where appropriate and perform mathematical fourier transforms on these function use figure 1 we derive various equation that produce prediction for our observation and measurement the light beam that travel an extra distance 2t will have developed a phase shift relative to the other beam on arrive at the beam splitter this phase shift for monochromatic light will only produce maximum and minimum when we will observe maximum minimum in the intensity a when 't be equal to a quarter integer number of wavelength 𝑛=1,3,5… 1 from this we can deduce that the intensity oscillates between maximum and minimum with a periodicity of 𝑡 𝑛 𝜆/4 there be two type of fringe that we can expect haidinger or fizeau haidinger fringe be observe when the tilt label in figure 1 be negligible this setup produce circular concentric fringe when the tilt be non-zero straight-line fizeau fringe be

distribution often well approximates a frequency spectrum of a light source i will now perform a fourier transform on the gaussian function this will yield an important result fundamental to the analysis of this experiment consider the gaussian function f t then the fourier transform f f x be define by it can be show that 7 therefore leave we see that the function 𝑔 𝜔 be also a gaussian the width of the new gaussian determine by sigma have be invert relative to the original function what this mean be that if we have a broad gaussian in position space large 𝜎 𝑓 this be equivalent to a tight gaussian in frequency space small 𝜎 𝑔 the spectral width δ𝜈 can be found from a measurement of the coherence length the coherence length can be measure from the interferogram directly it be the

use a green laser of small cross section the detector be remove we shone the laser at a wall around 3m from the beam splitter make sure no people be in it path a this laser could damage a human 's eye two separate dot be observe on the wall a non-zero tilt in both plane of the mirror be apparent we use the fine adjustment knob on mirror b to bring the two dot together until total superposition the equipment be then securely screw down to the optical table to minimise movement we insert a beam expander lens in front of the laser and haidinger fringe be observe we be now in a position to find the null point for this we start with the same green laser the green laser have a small spectral width and thus a broad interferogram so we can scan over a large range of t value and be observe fluctuation in amplitude once we have narrow down the location of the null point to an uncertainty of 2mm we remove the green laser and mount the white lead white light have a broad frequency spectrum fourier analysis tell u that this will yield a localise interferogram and so can refine our value of the null point to a high precision we scan over an increasingly small range around the null point until we see oscillation in amplitude of the interferogram nearer the null point the fringe become large at the null point no fringe be observe have reduce our uncertainty in the null point to ±0.001𝑚𝑚 we begin to take data this involve position the stage that support mirror c to a point behind the null point and then slowly translate the stage forward through the null point whilst take data our data logger take a pre-set 50 reading per second the slow we move the stage the more data we obtain the interferograms plot have oscillatory property with an overall gaussian-like envelope we plot the data use a linux terminal and perform an fft from the wavelength spectrum plot we can learn about the composition of the various light source and deduce value for the coherence length and spectral width the initial scan over the null point with green light be make from negative 5mm to +5mm this take around 16 minute whilst the stage move we observe the fringe change the circular fringe propagate outwards like water ripple after a stone be drop the fringe become wider nearer the null point once the mirror have move past the null point the direction of their movement be reverse the circular fringe then move inwards we watch the hypnotise fringe and make note of the approximate location at which this inversion occur from this we perform a scan with the green laser from 2.6mm to 3.5mm -figure 8. after narrow down the location of the null point to ±1mm we exchange the green laser for the white lead we complete a scan from 2mm to 4mm and plot the data -figure 9. figure 9 -lnterferogram scan.from 2mm to 4mm we measure a large spike at around 3.27mm the peak of this spike occurs at the null point we see the plot tail upwards on the right this implies misalignment of the interferometer and will be discus later we observe a large 'spike in amplitude at around 3.27mm we therefore do a slow scan 0.000 l mm/s from 3.265mm to 3.275 a range of0.0 l mm this yield the interferogram show below figure 10 -interferogram of white light over a total range ofo.olmm over the null point we see a semi-gaussian profile peak at 3.27lmm±0.001mm the null point ofour apparatus occurs at 3 27 i mm 0 001 mm this will be the centre of our scan from here onwards we must be careful not to knock the apparatus a the null point be extremely sensitive to the alignment we take an fft of our data in compare this to the theoretical gjaph from literature of a white lead spectrum figure 12 we can draw strong comparison of the shape over the visible spectrum range spectral width in figure jo we have overlaid a gaussian function for the envelope of the spectrum plot in red the sigma of this gaussian be 0.0006mm for white we assume a 1. therefore sigma be the coherence length from equation 7 we find that .dv 7.96 x 10 13 hz substitute this value into equation 8 with a value for il.av of 560nm ± 10nm we get that .da.whit• the approximate fwhm of our fft be measure to be 185nm±snm use equation 10 we obtain a sigma of79nm+ 4nm these value agree with each other to a 4.8 accuracy after complete a successful scan with the white lead we insert a blue lead we do some preliminary scan to get a feel for the coherence length of this new source our final scan be take from 3.262mm to 3.274mm with the null point now at 3 2685mm have move due to distribution of the apparatus a plot of our interferogram be show in figure 13. figure 13 show a neat gaussian distribution of amplitude for the interferogram section ii c tell u to expect the fft to also be gaussian so

this be likely due to a poor approximation of the red gaussian to the envelope function it be possibly too wide the aim of this experiment be to obtain value for the spectral width of three different light source by take detailed interferograms around the null point with an interferometer we want to gain an understand of the physical theory behind the experiment a well a the mathematics support this theory our intention be to compare these width with our expectation and value from literature the white lead and tungsten lamp be perhaps the two most important source that we take data from we expect the tungsten lamp to have a somewhat black-body spectrum which we do obtain we found that the fft of the tungsten interferogram have a large proportion of wavelength within infra-red this suggests that our detector can make measurement of electromagnetic radiation beyond the visible spectrum we found that the blue lead have the short spectral width of the three source measure a expect from it monochromatic appearance this come from the long interferogram with a wide coherence length we could observe interference beyond the first sigma of the gaussian in figure 9 we observe the consequence of a misalignment in the apparatus the general upwards trend of the spectrum indicates that the null point shift with respect to 't for the short range of 't that we take this do not seem to disrupt the result however give more time we would have like to realign the apparatus for more reliable data our fft gaussian plot e.g figure 14 be not smooth this be likely due to insufficient data in the interferogram or anomalous spike in the interferogram due to knock the apparatus 'mid-scan give more time we would take slow scan give more data give the environment of the lab in which we

54,2ndINT_JWI426_Redacted,we begin by review the basic concept behind implement a michelson interferometer a a fourier-transform spectrometer along with the associate theory behind this and the coherence length of a source we then detail the standard experimental setup procedure in which interferometer alignment be achieve by use of a monochromatic laser and the null point be found use a full spectrum lead by take the noise filter fft of interferograms to form spectrogram for a green laser white lead and blue lead a similar process be then carry out for a tungsten lamp and lowpressure mercury discharge tube both with and without the addition of green and yellow filter for all configuration the coherence length be approximate use a gaussian method for the tallest peak and by use a more sophisticated method involve autocorrelation function we then conduct a deeper analysis to determine the extent to which factor such a system misalignment and noise may have affected our result the michelson interferometer be perhaps the most well-known amplitude-splitting interferometer with it name hail from it be a variant of the apparatus use in the now famous 1887 michelson-morley experiment it have since remain a tremendously useful piece of apparatus with it see use in application range from the ligo interferometer 1 to fourier transform spectroscopy we will be use the latter of these application to measure the wavelength spectrogram for various source from which we can find the approximate coherence length of the source the interferometer consists of two mirror which be initially an equal distance 𝑑 from a central beam splitter along with a light source and detector arrange a show in figure 1. a the path difference 𝜀 between the two beam be varied by move the mirror opposite the detector the intensity 𝐼 at the detector will cycle between destructive and constructive interference for monochromatic light of wavelength 𝜆 this will happen every time 𝜀 be some multiple of 𝜆/2 note that 𝜀 be twice the stage offset from the null point ∆ since move the mirror by some increment have the effect of change the path difference by twice that increment we can then note the intensity be the complex modulus of the amplitude and use the complex exponential form of cosine to find if we then define 𝐼 2𝐸 𝐸 along with the wavenumber 𝑘 2𝜋/𝜆 we can write note that this be only for a monochromatic source if we consider a source which instead be compose of a vary spectral distribution give by 𝐼 𝑘 we need only sum over all the contribution from the differ spectral component by replace 𝐼 with 𝐼 𝑘 and integrate to yield from this it becomes clear that the rh be simply the cosine form of the fourier transform ℱ 𝐼 𝑘 of the wavenumber distribution since this establishes 𝜀 and 𝑘 a a fourier pair we can assert that we need only take the fourier transform of our measure interferogram 𝐼 𝜀 to obtain the wavenumber and by extension the wavelength spectrum of a source the coherence length of a source 𝐿 be the distance travel by a light wave over which it maintains a certain degree of coherence the formula for the coherence length of a gaussian spectrum with peak wavelength 𝜆 be give by where 𝑛 be the refractive index and ∆𝜆 be the spectral width of the source which we define a the range of wavelength over which the magnitude of the spectral component be great than the full-width-at-halfmaximum fwhm in the case of the michelson interferometer the coherence length be especially important a system misalignment will differ the phase difference between the two beam a the travel mirror be move which can have drastic affect on the quality of measure interferograms we can extend the definition of coherence length to apply to an arbitrary spectrum to do this we define the coherence factor a the autocorrelation between the two interfere wave a a function of time 2 and use the wiener-kolmogorov theorem to obtain we can then convert this into a function of shift displacement 𝑥 by use 𝑥 𝑐𝑡 by use 𝑐 𝑓𝜆 we can also note 𝑑𝜆 −𝑐𝑑𝑓/𝑓 which allows u to express 5 directly in term of the wavelength spectrum 𝐼 𝜆 since we be deal with a discrete signal our integral becomes a sum over the discrete 𝜆 and 𝑑𝜆 → ∆𝜆 the space between each wavelength we then obtain our final expression for the coherence factor a the coherence length can then be define a the value of 𝐿 for which γ 𝐿 𝑟γ 0 a before the choice of 𝑟 varies on the definition we wish to use to be consistent with the gaussian method 's use of the fwhm we will use 𝑟 0.5 to define 𝐿 unless state otherwise we begin the experiment by construct the michelson interferometer on an optical breadboard with arm length of 𝑑 ≈ 20𝑐𝑚 for all data collection run the entire setup be enclose within a black enclosure to reduce background interference for the alignment procedure a collimate monochromatic 532nm green laser be secure directly to the beam splitter this be then adjust until it be align with the breadboard grid with the beam centre on the travel mirror the travel mirror be secure directly to the breadboard and be interfaced directly with a computer for control and data collection the stationary mirror be then move and fine adjust until the beam fell on it centre and the final image form fizeau fringe on a screen place at the detector the presence of such fringe be also checked with the screen approximately a metre behind the detector position to give great confidence that correct alignment have be achieve a diverge lens be then insert between the laser and beam splitter which lead to the formation of concentric circular hadinger fringe a final check of alignment be do by carry out a scan over the stage position range of 𝑥 −12mm to +12mm a small gradient of the mean intensity corresponds to well alignment we repeat the realignment process until the gradient appear negligible over the full range with the system align the next step be to determine the position of the null point 𝑥 to do this we replace the green laser with a white tungsten source before a scan between 𝑥 −5𝑚𝑚 to 5mm be carry out this allow u to determine the approximate position of the null point in the first few scan we attempt to use a stage step of approximately 6nm which lead to erratic bunching in data point we later found this be because the stage have a minimum travel of approximately 20nm thus the 6nm travel command result in a breakdown of the stage 's ability to resolve it own position from this point only step value large than 20nm be use to avoid this undesirable effect a high resolution scan be then make between ±1 from the approximate null point which give u a detailed interferogram for tungsten around the null point the peak of the envelope of the interferogram show in figure 7 a corresponds to the null point position this process be repeat with and without the presence of ground glass between the source and the beam splitter the use of ground glass be qualitatively see to reduce the asymmetry of the interferogram about the null point with the unfiltered tungsten scan complete we next take scan for tungsten with green and yellow filter apply separately in both case a longer scan range be use to accommodate the introduction of the envelope beating now occur on either side of the central maximum the tungsten source be then replace with a lowpressure mercury lamp which be not secure directly to the beam splitter the same process of take a scan for both the green and yellow filter be then do at the end of the experiment we begin to investigate the zeeman effect in the mercury green line although due to time constraint this could not be peruse in depth the green laser interferogram show a clear sinusoidal shape show in figure 3. the fft before and after a noise filter 1 of this signal show in figure 3 suggests the source be not exactly monochromatic with multiple different peak within the green range alternatively we can split the interferogram up into section over which we assume there be only a single wavelength active figure 5 show how the fit wavelength for each section varies with the stage position the fit wavelength varies in a roughly periodic fashion suggest the spread in wavelength be in part due to some form of misalignment broad spectrum source such a the lead 's and unfiltered tungtsen lamp be comprise of many spectral component meaning they have a very localise interferogram hence their utility in find the null point from the interferogram in figure 8 we obtain an approximate peak wavelength of 742nm use wein 's displacement law we can calculate the temperature correspond to this peak wavelength to be approximately 3910k this result must be incorrect a this surpasses the melt point of tungsten which be approximately 3695k 3 a possible explanation for this be that the detector be less sensitive in the ir range meaning the spectrogram peak at a low high energy wavelength under ideal condition the wavelength spectrum of the filter source should depend only on the raw spectrum and the spectral width of the filter under normal condition the mercury green line be stable with a wavelength of 546.1nm 4 and can thus be use to quantify the variation in the stage 's movement in theory we could have use this to then improve our spectrogram by alter the distance between our fft sample in accordance with the stage variation this be decide against a from figure 13 we can see there be some amplitude modulation indicate poor alignment thus use this data would have likely decrease the quality of our spectrogram another way of investigate stage movement be to consider how stable it speed be to do this we can plot distance against time for the stage travel in figure 15 a and b show how the average speed and linear regression coefficient vary for the green mercury scan here the mean value of r be 0.9998 ± 0.0005. the fact that the stage speed be not stable will decrease the quality of our spectrogram table i. a summary of the full spectral width at half maximum and the coherence length obtain by approximate the large peak of the spectrum a a gaussian and apply 4 the uncertainty here be derive use 8 show in the appendix the value for the refractive index of air be take a 𝑛 1.0003±0.0001 5 all 𝜆 value be assume to have an uncertainty of 1nm the coherence length obtain by consider the full spectrum and use 7 be show in the rightmost column from table i it be clear that the presence of multiple peak within a spectrogram can have a significant

michelson interferometer a a fourier transform spectrometer we have be able to determine the approximate coherence length of several source when align correctly such a setup can produce exquisitely accurate measurement a feat which be found to be surprisingly challenge over the course of the experiment if the experiment be to be repeat great emphasis should be place achieve correct alignment

interferometer have be use to observe celestial body both within and beyond our solar system for example single-aperture interferometly have be use to investigate the solar system image detail such a the stm and stmspots i see source i for a detailed summary of optical astronomy use interferometer research into other discipline of science have also benefit from interferomet iy due to the ability to study both macroscopic and microscopic system for instance living cell through microspectrofluorometry and fluorescent image be image use excitation and emission spect i•oscopy to do this a michelson interferometer be use a a fast fourier transfo1m spectrometer 2 see source 2 for more on this this repo1t will discus the investigation unde1taken on different light source which be inspect use a michelson interferometer use a a fast fourier t1•ansfo1m spectrometer the interferograms and spectral line obtain of these light source will be analyze such a compare with simulation source of enor from the study will then also be consider thus this repo1t will illust i•ate the essential consideration require when study interferomet iy and the general application common source of enor in interferometly such a alignment and vibration will also be evaluate within this report a similar setup to the one use in this report could be use to explore other light source hence the detector can measure an interference pattern when vary d. in this experiment m 1 be move a in fig 1 such that d varied the interference pattern interferogram detect due to this be then subject to fourier analysis to obtain the spectral line of the light source the rest of this report will cover more of the theoretical background involve the experimental method and analysis of data finally there will be a discussion on the quality of the experiment and the result obtain generally when two coherent wave superimpose with each other they produce an interference pattern consider two superimpose monochromatic wave v 1 r t and v 2 r t the interference pattern be give by where v r t be the superposition of the two wave the displacement of v r t varies from an amplitude great than the combine amplitude of v 1 and v 2 to zero depend on the phase of v 1 and v 2 at that point 1 if ψ 1 ψ 2 є ℂ be complex amplitude of v 1 and v 2 with phase θ 1 and θ 2 respectively then the intensity of the superimpose wave be where i 1 v 1 2 i 2 v 2 2 be the average intensity of v 1 and v 2 respectively and ½ ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ 1 ψ 2 corresponds to the amount of interference between the two wave 1 the interference term a see in 2 between the two wave be dependent on the phase of v 1 and v 2 where δx be the path difference between the two wave and λ be the wavelength in a vacuum 1 a more thorough discussion on interference and treatment of wave can be found in source 1 in a michelson interferometer the two superimpose wave can be consider a monochromatic thus they produce an interference pattern which be only a function of path difference this interference pattern be described by the follow equation where t be the path difference travel by the two wave θ be the angle of incidence and m be the order of interference from fig 1 t =│d -d'│ when m be an integer the two wave be in phase thus constructively interfere result in a maximum the separation between maximum be constant and equal to λ/2 the wavelength of light emit by a light source be described by a spectral line which plot the intensity of light a a function of wavelength the spectrum intensity i λ of a source be give by where i j λ be a component of the spectral line due to a wavelength λ j and δi be noise i j λ be often model a a well-defined function such a a gaussian or lorentzian base on the light source 3 source 3 discus how equation 5 can be numerically analyze through take derivative to estimate parameter such a n. the distribution of intensity for a gaussian spectral line follow the follow function where a j be the amplitude of the distribution λ j be the wavelength at a j and σ j 2 be the variance of the distribution σ j 2 be related to 1/2 fwhm κ j a source 3 detail how the value of a j and σ j can be estimate through the method of take derivative however due to noise δi the estimate for these value do have significant error 3 experimentally spectral line distribution be generate through inverse fourier transforms of an interferogram which be the interference pattern observe by a michelson interferometer ideally the interferogram f x will be define by the follow where f be the frequency x be the path difference s f be the spectral distribution and φ be the phase error of the experiment 4 φ be a variable that depends on how the frequency and path difference be control φ can thus be separate into it cause where g f be a function of the frequency and h x f be a function of path difference and frequency path dependent phase error include alignment error affected by path difference whilst frequency dependent phase error could include electronic signal property 4 source 4 discus the treatment of phase error and common cause of them in more detail the coherence length of a light source in a michelson interferometer be analogous to the path difference the two wave can have before the interferogram can no longer distinguish noise from interference the coherence length of a source can be calculate from the spectral line a follow where l be the coherence length for a gaussian spectral line 5 figure 2. this figure show a simulation of the gaussian spectral line which would be expect for a light source of mean wavelength 500nm and standard deviation of 40nm this represent the parameter of λ j and σ j respectively a in equation 6 an arbitrary amplitude be plot against the wavelength of the light source the program use to simulate this take multiple delta function for the wavelength of the source whose arbitrary amplitude have be limited appropriately refer to fig 2 equation 6 show that if σ j be reduce the broadness of the spectral line would decrease seem more like a single wavelength of light be emit from the source a a result the interferogram in fig 3 would become broader a σ j decrease this can be see from equation 10 because the coherence length increase for the light source when the two mean wavelength in fig 4 become sufficiently similar for an appropriate standard deviation beating effect occur in the interferogram the general gaussian envelope remains in this case the setup use in this experiment be identical to that show in fig 1. a thor lab ccm1-bs013/m beam due to the dielect11c plate this be align with a thor lab kml 00 miirnr by eye of where the reflect beam hit the beam splitter this mirror be connect to a motor which meant that the miirnr have a range of motion of 25mm perpendicular to the incident beam thus this mirror represent mt in fig i. this process be repeat for another identical mirror use conti•ols to tilt the miirnr into alignment due to the range of motion of the move miirnr this mirror have to be position such that both miirnrs could be equidistant from the beam splitter this be necessa1y because the interferograms of the light source under investigation have a coherence length of a few micrometer so the null point where d d have to exist within the range of movement a thor lab convex lens with a 25.4mm focal length be attach to the beam splitter such that incident light from the light source would diverge and expand hence the superimpose beam which be project onto d in fig i would produce an enlarge image this make it easy to refine the alignment and to see an interference pattern a green laser be use to align this setup in fig i a a green laser be coherent so it do n't diverge this make alignment easy also the specti•al line of a laser be relatively na1rnw almost like a delta function so the coherence length of the inte1ferogram be more than a few cm hence an interference pattern be see throughout the 25mm range of motion of mt a photodetector be then place in position d of fig i which be connect to a computer the photodetector sample a signal at a rate of 50hz to acquire interferograms of light source with a coherence length of the order of micrometer the null point have to be found to a high precision of roughly 10 order of interference since visible light have a wavelength of the order of 10-1 this be found by move mt across it range of motion when the miirnr move too fa t vibration of the motor cause no interference pattern to be see thus the speed of the miirnr be set to no more than 0.005 mm/s from equation 4 a the miirnr move towards the null point the path difference and the order of interference would reduce for a give 0 to exploit this a haidinger fonge pattern be produce obse1vationally this meant that the ring of the interference pattern would collapse into the center when move towards the null point when the ring of the interference pattern begin to expand the miirnr have past the null point through this method the null point be found to an accuracy of 5x 10-6 m. when investigate other light source the convex lens be remove a they be extend source which be much weaker than the laser by the nyquist theorem the sample rate be set to take roughly 10 sample per oscillation when at a speed of o.ool mm/s thus enough information about the interference pattern be obtain for data analysis 5000 sample be take within the range scan at this speed the rate of sample do vary by ± 2 sample per oscillation to the near integer which be evaluate by take measurement of many cycle for repeat experiment this systematic e1rnr would have no bearing on find the specti•al line or do data analysis because of the nyquist theorem od d figure 6. this figure illustrates the effect of an alignment error on a beam which be offset by an angle 0 from perfect alignment from fig l the beam travel to the move mirror m1 be misalign from the desire path by an angle of the order of 10-3 c_ this show that when the mirror move by a small displacement od the change in path length of the beam be 2oh co 0. because of this when the interferogram graph be plot for position of the mirror against signal strength the detect signal have be stretch by a factor of co 0 relative to actual change in path length this be also true for the spectral line graph a mention in fig 2 during the alignment of the interferometer use the green laser there be a misalignment between the beam splitter and the move mirror m t. this misalignment result in a systematic error of the interferogram and spectral line graph to reduce this systematic error the distance d a in fig i between the beam splitter and mt be make a big a possible this reduce the angle of misalignment however reduce the error through well alignment be limited to human precision from this error the null point be not actually when d d but when d be roughly 3 wavelength less than d from calculation estimate however this systematic error of the position of the null point would only translate the interferogram graph which be eliminate when inverse fom'ier ti•ansfonning to get specti•al line furthe1more it be found that the stretch factor of co 0 a discus in fig 2 would be too insignificant to affect the data analysis of graph this be because the resolution of the distance move by m 1 a well a the wavelength of the light source be too large to measure such a small change due to alignment this be support far by take a small angle approximation such that the stretch factor of co θ can be approximate to 1  investigate light source white and blue lead source a well a a tungsten source be investigate use this method of fourier transform spectroscopy filter be also use to investigate what effect the spectral width of the filter would have on the spectral line a range of 0.1mm around the null point be scan at a speed of 0.001mm/s a mention in the method 5000 sample be take to cover this range take 10 ± 2 sample per oscillation the photodetector connect to a computer take data for the interferogram of the light source computational analysis use the scipy.fftpack package then perform fast fourier transforms to obtain the spectral line of the light source figure 8. this figure show the spectral line obtain for the blue lead through computational analysis and fast fourier transforms a in fig 2 amplitude against wavelength be plot an approximate gaussian spectral line can be see with a peak amplitude at roughly 450nm which be within the range of blue wavelength figure 9. this figure show the spectral line of a tungsten source which will be approximate to be gaussian the peak amplitude be see at a wavelength of 900nm which be within the range of roughly 300-1000nm assume the blue lead spectral line be gaussian the coherence length be estimate use equation 10 and equation 7 the value of λ blue be estimate to be 4.51 ± 0.01 × 10 -7 m and σ blue be estimate to be 0.11 ± 0.01 × 10 -7 m use notation from equation 6 from equation 10 add fractional error in quadrature the coherence length be estimate a 2.9 ± 0.2 × 10 -6 m. the same assumption be make for the spectral line of tungsten the value of λ tungsten be 8.80 ± 0.20 × 10 -7 m and σ tungsten be 1.34 ± 0.07 × 10 -7 m. use the same data analysis the coherence length be 9.2 ± 0.5 × 10 -7 m. the coherence length for a tungsten lamp be small than that of the blue lead because the spread of the spectral line for tungsten be broader thus the interferogram for the tungsten lamp be narrower a predict by equation 10 when put a yellow and green filter in front of the tungsten lamp the spectral line be n't smooth and have multiple maximum and minimum in amplitude the peak amplitude of the spectral line be at roughly 535nm for the green filter and 605nm for the yellow filter this happen due to the spectral width of the filter passing through a range of wavelength within the bandwidth of those filter the lack of smoothness may have be due to interaction with the filter such a absorption effect a white lead be also investigate the spectral line for this be also not smooth however have 4 distinct peak amplitude these occur at wavelength of roughly 700nm 625nm 550nm and 475nm this be likely because white lead source be usually construct out of mainly red blue and green wavelength of light the most significant random error propagate themselves into the data a noise vibration such a write on the table and the motor be one of these random error a thor lab nexus optical table be use to set the experiment up on this contribute to reduce vibration and keep the alignment relatively fix during the experiment we also limited movement during the experiment a much a possible include not write on the same desk a the setup the photodetector be a photodiode attach to an amplifier with variable gain hence the gain level for each experiment be set to the high to reduce noise environmental factor also contribute to the noise for example other source of light effect the setup be contributor to random error to reduce background light level the setup be contain within a matte black box internally the setup be also conduct in a dark room the contain box be also make of plastic and be reflective on the outside this would reduce temperature variation a heat conduction and radiation transfer be both reduce this be another source of random error a temperature change would affect the intensity spectrum of wavelength emit a well a thermal expansion of the equipment affect alignment hence the light source be only turn on during the experiment to reduce internal heating of the light source from the interferograms these consideration reduce the effect of random error to a level of 5 of the signal amplitude the aim of this experiment be to investigate the characteristic of different light source when under the investigation of fourier transform spectroscopy this be do by set up a michelson interferometer which be accurately align and setup many systematic error associate with the experiment such a alignment be significantly reduce or evaluate this be achieve due to the accurate equipment use and the careful consideration make during the experimental method source of random error be also reduce to an estimate 5 of maximum amplitude of the signal a mention in the method and quantify by equation 5 and 9 the source of random error introduce themselves into the data a mostly background noise such source include environmental factor vibration and electronic noise the fourier transform spectrometer integrate a computer to record data computational method and analysis be then use to obtain interferograms and spectral line this be do for different source of light under experimental investigation this experiment could successfully analyze the characteristic of some light source the spectral line of these light source could be approximate to function such a gaussians this make data analysis possible and parameter of the spectral line and interferograms able to be determine such a standard deviation and coherence length however the experimental method and setup have not be refine enough to analyze more complex source of light this include the green laser use to align the setup which experienced large fluctuation in line spectrum due to significant random error such a temperature variation also the tungsten light with filter and the white light spectrum be not very smooth under this experiment to improve this method of characterize the different light source the data take around the null point should have be confine to roughly 10 micrometer rather than the 0.1mm range of data which be use this would reduce the noise effect which would enter the interferogram and spectral line graph thus if part of the noise have a frequency dependence such a electronic noise or vibration then this effect would be reduce also any beating effect which occur outside of the gaussian interferogram would have less of an impact on the spectral line,superficial,bal,65,0.922979414,0.077020533

interferometer in order to study the luminiferous ether 1 the lack of record effect provide an experimental cornerstone for the theory of relativity a fourier transform spectrometer ft have the same basic configuration a a michelson interferometer except one of the mirror can be move along one axis 2 fourier transform spectroscopy have aid breakthrough in the molecular spectrum of star and planet splitting in atomic spectrum super conductor energy-gap measurement and magnetic resonance to name a few 3 the experimental design and associate theory involve with these device be core to modern physic optical filter selectively transmit light of different wavelength a a ft can be use to analyse the constituent wavelength of a source a practical application of the spectrometer be to identify the range of wavelength pas by a filter of unknown spectral width a ft allows analysis of a light source by investigation of the effect of path difference on resultant intensity the translate mirror can be adjust so that the two light path l 1 and l 2 described in figure 1 travel different length before recombination the difference in these length be define a and be equal to the path difference between the light at recombination note that the distance l 1 and l 2 be twice the distance from the beamsplitter to the mirror if the translate mirror be move by a distance x the change in path difference be of magnitude 2x when the mirror be arrange such that l 1 l 2 correspond to d 0 the interferometer be say to be at it null point a there be no path difference between light from each source light will constructively interfere upon recombination fig 1 in a ft source light be incident on a beamsplitter which then separate the light so that it follow two different path for path l 1 light continue to propagate parallel to the source beam and be incident on the translate mirror for path l 2 light be reflect perpendicularly to the source beam so that it be incident on the mirror label fix mirror light from both path then recombines at the beamsplitter before it intensity be measure at the detector 4 fig 2 due to the action of the beamsplitter mirror m 2 appear to be parallel to m 1 in position m 2 the optical path can then be related by the angle θ and the distance d where d d 2 4 with light incoming from an extend source the angle θ will vary the geometry of figure 2 give where m be the order of interference and λ be the wavelength of the source when the mirror be set up with equal inclination the cylindrical symmetry of the situation result in circular fringe know a haidinger fringe if an angle of inclination be introduce between the mirror this symmetry be lose and straight line fizeau fringe of equal thickness be form fig 3 haidinger fringe of equal inclination which occur when θ 0 and appear to be at infinity 5 use a coherent visible light source around the null point haidinger fringe be clearly identifiable with the naked eye a the null point be approach d → 0 the fringe pattern will appear to collapse with fringe move toward the centre then disappear reduce the number of visible ring 6 this be show in figure 4. a ft allows interferograms of signal intensity against position of movable mirror proportional to path difference to be plot the peak of the path difference spectrum be locate at the null point this spectrum be useful a the intensity of the recombine beam a a function of the path difference d can be fourier transform to the intensity of the light source a a function of wavenumber inverse wavelength 2 from this the constituent wavelength of the source can be plot the coherence length l of a source be define a the optical path difference when interference visibility drop to half it maximum value 7 a the interferograms be approximately gaussian in nature we can define the coherence length of a signal intensity against path difference plot a the full width half maximum fwhm of the signal intensity against position of mirror plot this be a position of mirror=2 d and f w hm 2×distance to half intensity the fwhm of a gaussian can be found from where σ be the standard deviation of the gaussian 8 the coherence length be related to the spectral width by the equation where ν be the spectral width and c 3.0 × 10 8 m −1 to relate this to the spectral width of the wavelength of the source we use where λ be the wavelength of the light and λ be the spectral width of the wavelength 5 we can thus find value for the spectral width of the wavelength from the coherence length of the source a tungsten lamp also know a a incandescent lamp produce light through heating of a thin tungsten wire to around 2700k 9 the majority of the light produce by the lamp be in the infra-red range but some intensity of all visible wavelength be produce fig 5 a typical emission spectrum for a tungsten lamp with the region of radiation visible to the human eye label 10 the term 'optical filter refers to any device that selectively transmits/blocks wavelength of light within the visible range 350−750nm within this range of visible wavelength there be small range that correspond to specific colour the two colour examine in this experiment be green and yellow with approximate wavelength range of 500 − 550nm and 550 − 620nm respectively 11 optical filter can be broken down into two main category absorptive and dichroic the difference between the two be in how they filter light not in what they filter absorptive filter absorb the wavelength of light that be not pas whereas dichroic filter reflect them 12 filter can also be described by the range of frequencies/wavelengths that they pa low-pass filter allow frequency below a certain value to pa and block or attenuate great frequency high-pass frequency act oppositely restrict frequency below a certain value and passing frequency great than that value band-pass filter can be make from a combination of the low and high-pass filter allow wavelength within a select range to pa the ft apparatus be construct on an optical breadboard it comprise one fix base mirror a translate mirror a beamsplitter and a detector the fix base have mirror two control for adjustment of the vertical and horizontal inclination of the mirror on top the stand without alter height or base position the translate mirror involve a fix inclination mirror attach on top of a computer control translate bench the bench have a range of −12.5mm +12.5mm about it zero and could be move from any point in this range to any other point at a give speed the beamsplitter be house in a cube with transparent glass wall such that other component could be connect to it a oppose to have the light source attach to the top of a stand they be directly screw into the other end of a tube attach to the beamsplitter the detector be also connect to the computer but not directly to the bench and sample at a fix rate of 50hz in order for the spectrometer to produce measurable fringe the entire apparatus have to be precisely align this meant both in the same optical plane and with correct orientation relative to each other a the optical breadboard and all attach apparatus be from the same manufacturer the optical plane be predetermine to be at a common level attach the light source to the beamsplitter via the tube remove the possibility that the beamsplitter and light source be not in the same optical plane ensure correct orientation so that both light path be precisely follow involve great manual calibration all component be attach to the breadboard so that they seem approximately correctly align board be then place at 45 • the desire path of l 1 and l 2 so that all arm of the interferometer be optically isolated this be to prevent uninterfered light passing directly to the detector and affect result to isolate the detector from external light a black box cover the experiment while reading be be take the distance between each mirror and the beamsplitter be measure use a ruler and adjust until they be approximately equal so that d ≈ 0. these measurement do not require great precision a so long a the null point be with the 25mm movement range of the translate mirror it would be locatable a green laser be then use to calibrate the set up and find the null point this laser be use a it be a coherent monochromatic visible light source whose interference pattern be clear to the naked eye a all other component by then be properly align the only adjustment to be make to find fringe be the inclination of the fix base mirror by adjust the inclination haidinger fringe become visible the mirror be be adjust until the centre of the central fringe be exactly position so that be incident of the detector to get an intuition a to the position of the null point the detector be move so that fringe move towards the centre and disappear a in figure 4. the green laser be then replace with a tungsten lamp also attach to the tube a scan over a large position range about the suspect position where d 0 be perform to precisely locate the null point see a a peak in intensity a slow scan over a small region contain the null point be perform to obtain useful data around the peak this be then repeat with the green and yellow filter separately the filter be attach to the output side of the beamsplitter such that the filter be the last component the light pas through before reach the detector the record spectrum be then pas through the scipy fft module a quick computational method of perform fourier transforms from the transforms amplitude be plot against wavelength the mean wavelength of each source could then be found an algorithm be write that tracked the maximum value of the curve across the position spectrum essentially outline the envelope of the peak these envelope be then fit to gaussian curve which give standard deviation σ a a fit coefficient the fwhm be determine use equation 3. from this the spectral width of the wavelength of the source with and without filter be found use equation 4 and 5. a spike in signal intensity be observe in the longer range scan of the unfiltered tungsten lamp figure 6. repeat the fig 6 a scan over a large proportion of the −12.5 +12.5mm range with a clear spike in instensity between −2 and −1mm this scan be execute at 0.1mms −1 scan at a slow speed over a small region allow the spike to be analyse in great detail a gaussian be then fit to the data this fit coefficient of the gaussian give σ 0.49µm use equation 3 the fwhm be calculate a 1.16µm the process be then repeat about the same null point with the green filter and then yellow filter attach with the green filter attach the fit gaussian give σ 7.52µm with a correspond fwhm of 17.71µm the yellow filter result be of the same order with σ 6.81µm and a fwhm of 16.03µm the data be pas through the fft algorithm to give wavelength spectrum the significantly broader path difference plot for the filter light in comparison to the unfiltered lamp light correspond to much more localise wavelength distribution the mean wavelength λ of each spectrum be list in table i alongside the generally accepted range for that colour λ range 11 the spectral width of each spectrum λ calculate use each coherence length l and equation 4 and 5 be list in table i a λ l it be clear that these value be significantly small than the true width of the spectrum see in figure fig 8 the wavelength spectrum for the unfiltered green filter and yellow filter tungsten lamp the black green and yellow line correspond to the unfiltered green filter and yellow filter light respectively result normalise so that the maximum value for each spectrum be 1. colour unfiltered 350-750nm 752nm 39nm 277nm green 500-550nm 533nm 1.3nm 23nm yellow 550-620nm 566nm 1.6nm 27nm 8. although the wavelength spectrum do not show a clear gaussian form fwhm can be found use the normalise amplitude from figure 8 and find the width of a spectrum at amplitude=0.5 this provide an alternative measurement of the spectral width for wavelength list in the table a λ f w hm these value be more appropriate than those label λ l it be clear that the unfiltered light span a great range of wavelength than 39nm a such the quote result use λ f w hm a λ. the reason for this discrepancy be unclear and be worthy of far investigation the unfiltered wavelength in figure 8 constitute many colour in the visible range which can be visually demonstrate by look at the fringe pattern produce by the ft both filter wavelength distribution show a sharp nearsymmetrical peak this be indicative of narrow band-pass filter the unfiltered tungsten lamp show the gradual increase in amplitude with increase wavelength until around 750nm expect for an incandescent light source 10 a the mean wavelength of the tungsten lamp be outside the visible range the detector be show some ability to detect infra-red wavelength it be also know a see in figure 5 that the tungsten lamp be produce wavelength great than those see in figure 8 the gradual die off of wavelength intensity between 750−1000nm be due to the detector not be able to record these wavelength a oppose to an effect of the lamp in all fourier transform wavelength plot the unit on the y ax hold little significance a to clearly see fringe the gain of the detector be adjust this mean that the amplitude of the signal be only relevant to data from the same scan not comparison between scan this mean the analysis be limited in only show the range of wavelength pas not demonstrate any secondary effect the filter may have on intensity a perfect filter would not alter intensity of the incident light however this be unlikely to be the case with real experimental data to investigate this a single value of detector gain could be identify at which all fringe be sufficiently visible the rest of the analysis would be identical except that the intensity of the green and yellow result could be compare to the unfiltered result and the attenuate effect of the filter could be measure another limitation of this method analyse filter be the lack of information regard whether they be absorptive or dichroic a the difference between the two type be in how they filter and not what they filter study the filter spectrum do not distinguish between the two to gain a deeper understand of the filter their nature must either be know from the manufacturer or determine through an another alternative empirical technique a possible method of experimental identification could be measure the temperature of the filter while in use it would be expect that in absorb certain frequency the absorptive filter would become warmer to a great extent than the dichroic filter a major shortcoming of this experiment be the lack of proper error analysis often in the analysis of spectrum standard deviation σ be quote a error this value be incorporate into the calculate value for λ l which be then reject anyway the value use for λ act a a broad uncertainty for λ a the true value for the mean must lie within the spectral range for wavelength to develop this experiment a more thorough method of handle error analysis must be developed in figure 7 a show a less smooth curve than both a and b with few data point this be a all three interferograms be produce by move the translate mirror at the same speed 0.5µms −1 even though the unfiltered result be over a much small distance range although time consume if the experiment be to be repeat it would be worth repeat the process for the unfiltered lamp at a slow speed the nyquist frequency be not consider during the analysis of this experiment a the determine wavelength fell within the expect region and the spectrum take expect shape thus it be extremely improbable that we be sample at an inappropriate frequency however if the experiment be repeat under different condition care would have to be take to ensure the sample frequency be great than the nyquist frequency the aim of the experiment be to analyse the nature of two optical filter when use with a tungsten lamp use a fourier transform spectrometer interferograms of the detect signal intensity against position of the translate mirror be then plot and fit to gaussian curve from which the coherence length and subsequently spectral width of the source be determine these value be found to be unrepresentative of the measure spectrum these interferograms be then transform to frequency spectrum use a fft algorithm from which the wavelength of the source be found along with new value for spectral width for wavelength the unfiltered light be found to have λ 752nm λ 277nm the filter be found to limit this to λ green 533nm λ green 23nm and λ yellow 566nm λ yellow 27nm in order to improve the analysis of the filter the experiment could be repeat with fix gain so the filter effect on intensity could be determine the absorptive or dichroic nature of the filter could also be investigate a more thorough method of handle error should also be employ,prediction,none,70,0.924450815,0.075549163

measurement of the order of a few nanometre 2 when use with monochromatic high-frequency laser and appropriate optical element the resolution achieve by an interferometer exceeds any other technique 3 in 2014 a shrink in the space-time fabric of 10 −18 m due to the collision of two black hole be make by the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ligo this detection lead to the discovery of gravitational wave 2 4 however any apparatus be only a good a it weak component whose quality be often limited by it price in a teach laboratory for example resource be limited and obviously ligo 's level of precision be completely out of reach for any laboratory with a university-sized budget yet it be possible within a certain limit to correct for systematical error induced by faulty equipment this paper will investigate how to increase the precision of an interferometer without increase the price by consider how the accuracy of it less reliable component -a v-408 pimag linear stage-can be increase the experiment relies on the interference of two coherent beam of light the analysis of the interference of the beam be make by vary the path difference between the beam by slowly move one of the mirror from which the light reflect the intensity of the result beam a a function of the path difference of the beam be then collect and analyse if the path difference be an integer multiple of the wavelength then the interference be constructive and the intensity observe be maximal for a path difference equal to an half-integer multiple of the wavelength the interference be destructive and the light have minimal intensity 5 for a give setup it be very useful to define the null point this corresponds to the position of the move mirror such that the path difference be zero between the two beam 6 ideally the null point should lie at the centre of the stage to allow the large range of motion -and hence data collection-around the null point when the move mirror be at the null point all wavelength present in the source interfere constructively with one another example of interference pattern can be see in fig 1. it be possible to extract the different frequency present in a light source from it interferogram assume the law of superposition and that the electric field be a real quantity it can be show that this process involves a fourier transform of the form 7 where b σ be the flux density correspond to the wave number σ i r δ be the flux of light a a function of δ -the path difference between the two beams-and i r 0 be the flux of light measure when the move mirror be at the null point apply equ 1 to an interferogram reveals the wavelength λ correspond to wavenumbers σ 2π λ present in the light source 7 upon collect data it be very important tomake the interference pattern visible a few data point have to be record within a period of the wave to insure fidelity to the analog signal and to minimize sample effect 6 for a stage travel at speed s and a detector collect data at a frequency f the distance travel by the stage between two record point be accord to the nyquist theorem a discrete signal contains all the information of an analog signal if the sample frequency f s be great than half of the high frequency present in the analog signal the correspond equation be 8 be f max be the high frequency present in the source 's light note that for a monochromatic electromagnetic wave the only frequency f max present in the signal be related to the wavelength λ by f max c λ rearrange eq 3 one can find the maximal distance between consecutive point in the sample such that the discrete signal complies with nyquist 's sample theorem combine this with eq 2 we find the high speed s max at which the stage can travel so that the record signal be akin to the analogous signal use the follow equation be f be the sample frequency and λ be the light 's wavelength the set-up use corresponds to a michelson interferometer and be base on thorlab 's edu-mint2 kit 2,6 the source use in this experiment be a green laser of wavelength 533 ± 1nm experimentally verify and a mercury lamp with a yellow filter the light be divide by the beamsplitter and reflect by two mirror one fix and the another attach to a computer control move stage before be re-combined and measure by the detector a picture of the set-up can be see in fig 2. when use the green laser the yellow filter be remove and the mercury lamp exchange for the green laser fix to a convex lens the laser be directly fix to the arm of the beamsplitter to ensure that the alignment and the amount of light receive be optimal the mirror be carefully align face the appropriate side of the beamsplitter so that the two path be perpendicular the set up be construct so that the light hit each mirror a close to it centre a possible to reduce any error due to potential curvature of these mirror the move stage use be the v-408 pimag linear stage accord to the data sheet it minimum incremental motion be 20nm 9 the detector use be a silicon pin photodiode model sfh 2200 which be most efficient between wavelength of 400nm and 1000 nm 10 the sample frequency of the detector use be 50hz which implies by eq 4 that all measurement have to be do with a stage move slow than 13.3µm.s −1 for high accuracy the speed of the stage be set between 2µm.s −1 and 0.1 µm.s −1 because of the sample frequency this corresponds distance between consecutive point of 2nm to 40nm this low bound be chosen to investigate how much the stage movement be affected by it speed be slow than the recommend limit a second factor for choose this range of speed be the time constraint one of the aim of this set-up be to estimate the spectrum of light emit by various source an easy way to estimate the mean wavelength of a signal be to manually measure the distance between the node in the interferogram the mean distance between the node be equal to half of the mean wavelength 11 measure the mean distance between node in the interferogram for mercury light with a yellow filter yield wavelength of 583.5 ± 31.0nm for accuracy the period measure be take roughly uniformly along the interferogram this method be quite inaccurate due to subjectivity in the location of the node and it be expect that the compute calculation of the wavelength present in fig 3. should be more precise and more accurate the spread in estimate wavelength for this preliminary data be approximately 40nm and it mean value be 580.33 ± 17.25nm this value be well in agreement with the manually measure value and be much more precise however the 2.97 error on this measurement be large for a high precision interferometer and a good proportion of line in atomic spectrum can not be correctly discern with such a high error 12 the pattern that arises in fig 3c could imply a error due to the position of the stage theoretically the value of the calculate wavelength should be indeed independent of the stage 's position if the latter move uniformly and return correctly the value of it position the estimate wavelength should also be independent of the stage 's speed assume this obeys eq 4 compare result with other group and other set of data indicate that this pattern arose in any set of data and that this error could potentially affect all the motor stage it be therefore decide to investigate this phenomenon and the green laser be chosen over the other source for quantitative analysis because it light be close to monochromatic and have a know wavelength a mention in the previous section a recognizable pattern appear when fitting the wavelength a show in fig 3c the estimation of the wavelength seem to be dependant on position of the stage figure 4 show the superposition of these pattern for run do over the same range but at different speed with the green laser qualitatively it be quite straightforward to see that the pattern be independent of the speed of the stage it be important to note that run do at 2µm.s −1 correspond to a distance between sample of 40nm displayed the same pattern a set of data do with sample distance of 15nm 6nm and 2nm the hypothesis that the stage 's limit distance between sample be 20nm a state on it data sheet can therefore be seriously doubt for reference the wavelength of this pattern be measure a 79.4±10.7µm secondly it be important to ensure that the observe pattern be only due to the stage and not the source use figure 5 present the estimation of the source 's mean wavelength a a function of the stage 's position for the green laser and the mercury lamp with a yellow filter it should be notice that the be present in both data set but only shift vertically this be completely expect since the green laser have a mean wavelength of 533nm whereas the yellow filter use with the mercury lamp only transmits light of wavelength between 567.3nm and 592.7nm 13 figure 5 hint that the fault in the stage affect the precision of the result but not their accuracy calculate the mean wavelength and standard deviation of each set of wavelength give 534.92 ± 16.68nm for the green laser and 580.33 ± 17.25nm for the mercury lamp finally the data set present in fig 4 and 5 be collect over the period of a few day during which the stage have be remove and put back into the system the stage 's error can not therefore be explain by a faulty fix of the stage to it support to account for the error cause by the stage it be chosen to base the correction on a single set of reference data collect with the green laser the position be then adjust for the calculate wavelength to match the accepted value a accurately and a precisely a possible the parameter of this correction be then use for correct any set of overlap data a the error be dependent only on the position of the stage the hypothesis chosen for the fitting be that the record position lag behind the true position by a scale factor this hypothesis be in line with the data take but it physical explanation be still unclear to correct this the program function with a small section of the sample correspond to a few period of the interferogram a sinusoidal function be then fit to this data and the optimization parameter be save because the position be record after the correspond data the wavelength of the signal be modify the correction of the position follow a scale equation where x the correct position of the signal be give by where x be the uncorrected position λ laser be the know value of wavelength of the test run λ f itted be the wavelength calculate for this small section of data point x p corr be the first uncorrected point of this section of data and x 0 be the last correct point of the previous section of point a the parameter x p corr λ f itted and x 0 be save it be then simple to correct any point by apply the correction give in eq 5 with the fitting parameter correspond to the region of space in which this specific point lie result of these fit be present in the next section multiple test be undertaken to verify the validity of the calculate correction 1 test with the green laser firstly set of data take with the green laser a the source over the same range of distance but at different speed be correct use the fitting parameter calculate from another set of data take again over the same range and in the same direction plot show the calculate wavelength for the same set of data correct and uncorrected set be present in fig 6. from this plot it be clear that • the beating in the plot of wavelength against the position be remove • the mean error in wavelength be 4.94nm which be low than the mean error for the unfitted data set which be 16.73nm in average • the mean of the wavelength be approximately equal to that in the unfitted case from these observation we can infer that the fit be efficient a it improves precision but conserve the accuracy it be useful to mention that the team suspect the quality of the sample take a reference influence the quality of the correct data 2 test with the mercury lamp it be verify that the systematic error be independent of the source in section iii it be therefore acceptable to infer that the correction calculate from the green laser 's data should be applicable to any set of data acquire over the same range it be especially useful to increase the resolution of the spectrum when work with source have emission ray separate by only a few nanometre for example mercury have a singlet line at 546.074 nm and a doublet at 576.959 nm and 579.065 nm 1 since it be show that the wavelength could vary by more than 40nm for the unfitted data set and since it be expect that the periodicity in the stage 's error alters the signal it seem impossible to resolve the line of mention above without a proper correction of the systematical error figure 7 present the distribution of the wavelength of the mercury light with a yellow filter in the fit and unfitted case it be very straightforward to see that the fit data be not only more precise but also more accurate than the unfitted data fig 7 comparison of the distribution of the calculate wavelength for the mercury light with a yellow filter the set of data use a reference for fit be a run make at 1µm.s −1 with the green laser over the same range the two line in the fit data have a wavelength of 530.9nm and 577.5nm and have a standard deviation of 2.4nm and 3.5nm respectively figure 7 show that the correction greatly improves the accuracy and precision of the signal the unfitted data spread from 630nm to 544nm the fit data on the other hand present two clear peak in the wavelength at 530.19 ± 2.4nm and 577.5 ± 3.5nm it should be mention that both the original and correct data set present wavelength small than 567.3nm which should not be the case if the yellow filter be properly use this anomaly be outside the scope of this study but could be investigate to estimate the overall accuracy of the set-up and analysis method use if the first line in the correct data be quite far from the expect value at 546.07nm 12 the second line corresponds nearly exactly to the mean between the wavelenghs of mercury 's doublet at 576.96nm and 579.07nm this second line contains both wavelength within it margin of error this experiment be affected by many source of error we have already mention the fault in the stage 's position record which be the big source of systematic error however this experiment be also affected by random error and other systematical error table i summarises the different source of error their magnitude and the mean by which the latter can be reduce unless state otherwise the magnitude of the error be give a their contribution to the wavelength 's standard deviation for the green laser correct the position use a test run with a laser of know wavelength a present above vibration more data be require but assume small because of large number of measurement do the experiment in an empty laboratory screw the optical component more tightly to the optical bench align each mirror so that light reflect upon their exact centre line broadening by doppler effect ≈ 3nm 6 14 15 switch off the mercury lamp regularly to allow cool down curvature of the mirror modify the path difference ± λ 10 in path difference 16 systematical error only shift the null point line broadening by doppler effect ≈ 5nm 6 14 15 switch off the mercury lamp regularly to allow it to cool down this study be quite limited in time and there be room for many adjustment and far precision the follow be consider of interest by the team and order by importance 1 write the code that would permit computation of the fourier transform of the correct signal attempt be make use a non-uniform fourier transform program but remain unsatisfactory the construction of a uniform set of data with the proper wavelength be also attempt but the difference in fitting parameter between the different section of data introduce discontinuity in the signal 2 check the range of speed over which the pattern arises and the data can be correct compare with nyquist 's limit frequency to determine the quality of the stage 3 check if the correction can be apply to any stage of the same model or if it stage dependent 4 check if the correction be dependant of the direction of the motor or only on it position on the stage 5 modify the code create for this study to be self explanatory and for it to automatically perform correction on any set of data if provide with a set of reference data 6 investigate the relationship between the size of the section take for fitting the quality of the correct data optimize the current code accordingly 7 use a laser whose wavelength be unique and experimentally verify to construct the data of reference 8 investigate the relationship between the quality of the data use a reference and the quality of the correct data this paper prof the presence of a systematical error due to an inaccurate record of the move stage position in an interferometry experiment it present a method to correct for this error by compute a periodic scale of the position for a set of data take over a long range with a laser of know wavelength the validity of this approach be then investigate by correct various set of data with different test run this correction be very efficient a it reduces the broadening of the spectral line from ten of nanometre to a few namometres whilst keep the accuracy of the initial set of data more precisely in the case of the mercury lamp the correction make it possible to distinguish two separate peak at 530.91 ± 0.21nm and 577.51 ± 0.34nm when the non-corrected data present a band of wavelength between 630nm and 544nm approximately if this first correct wavelength be shift significantly from the accepted value of 546.07nm 1 the second ray be close to the middle of the two wavelength that compose the expect doublet at 576.959 nm and 579.065 nm 1 the correction present in this paper negate the v-408 pimag linear stage 's physical limitation allow confident use of this set-up at low speed however this work be ongoing and the code to perform the

37,2ndINT_PHU922_Redacted,interferometry be a vital experimental technique with application across various field include but not limited to optic astronomy particle physic and general and special relativity this technique produce very precise interferograms of an emit source which be use in analysis to determine essential property of the source here a standard michelson interferometer setup be utilised in conjunction with a fast fourier transform fft algorithm to determine the wavelength of the green emission line of a mercury hg discharge lamp an accurate value of 545nm be determine 1 the coherence length be calculate inaccurately 1 to be 5.3µm which be a good indicator that misalignment be a considerable issue in conjunction with other issue of uncertainty brought about by the source and the move arm of the interferometer this experiment reproduces the classic michelson interferometry setup this procedure be first use by michelson in 1880 's when investigate the archaic ether theory 2 provide a good alignment of component be achieve an extremely precise interferogram of a source can be produce from which accurate and precise value of wavelength and coherence length and other property of the source can be determine here it be use for the purpose of determine the wavelength of a mercury discharge lamp green emission line move mirror apparatus be use to vary the path difference in the interferometer and thus the intensity of the interferogram be measure a a function of position of the mirror for computational speed a fast fourier transform algorithm be utilised to retrieve wavelength spectrum from the measure interferogram we be successful in use this technique to determine a very accurate wavelength for the green emission line of a mercury discharge lamp a 545nm 1 despite this the determine coherence length of this source be greatly inaccurate at 5.3µm the michelson interferometer be base on the principle of interfere a light source with itself by splitting it along two separate path figure one from this diagram by consider the additional distance travel by the light ray between the beamsplitter and m1 it can be show that constructive interference be satisfied by 3 where θ be the angle between the incident light ray on the mirror and the normal to the face of that mirror the null point of an interferometer be define a the point of maximum interference i.e zero path difference or t 0 4 at this point the fringe be at a maximum space so for this reason the null point be use a the data take range the physical interference pattern be continuous however data be take in discretely with sample rate t to produce an interferogram the data set x n be define by 5 where a n x signifies the amplitude of the signal at a point x x 0 be an arbitrary start position and ẋ be the velocity of the move platform ẋt be therefore the distance move between data point therefore it be appropriate to utilise a fast fourier transform algorithm which utilises the discrete fourier transform f d define by 6 this convert the data into frequency ν space from which wavelength can be directly calculate the coherence length l of a source be give by 3 where λ be mean wavelength ∆λ be the spread in wavelength of the source and directly corresponds to the fwhm ≈ 2.335σ of the gaussian wavelength spectrum produce the apparatus be setup accord to figure 1 and show in figure 2. a thorlabs nexus damped optical breadboard be utilised to reduce the possibility of external vibration invade the experiment for the alignment process a thorlabs cps532 green laser with an ac050-008-a-ml collimation package be employ it intensity facilitates relatively easy observation of the light path through the spectrometer the high intensity also greatly increase the clarity of the interference pattern thorlabs sm1l20 lens tube be use to avoid light escape subsequently the light be direct along two orthogonal path one at 90°to the incident beam towards move mirror m1 where it have be reflect by the beamsplitter and the other at 180°towards a thorlabs km100 stationary mirror m2 the design facilitates the adjustment of the azimuthal projection where the light have be transmit by the beamsplitter m1 be attach to a thorlabs remotely operate move platform the two light beam be recombine at the beamsplitter and be direct at 270°from the source beam towards an osram sfh 2200 photodetector with adjustable gain opaque screen be place along the perimeter of the breadboard in conjunction with a lid to eradicate background light interference black polystyrene screen be position inside the experiment to block light escape from the source which would be detect a noise see figure two the breadboard construction allows these component to be fix securely in place to eliminate any chance of suffuse mechanical misalignment within the interferometer due to vibration and accidental impact when change light source upon complete a satisfactory alignment when the null point have be found detailed in section iii.b the light source be subsequently change to a penray mercury hg discharge lamp to investigate the green light emission line of this source a thorlabs fl543.5-10 green filter be place a show in figure two uv protective glass be worn because the hg lamp be a strong short wave uv emitter a green laser be again utilised a the source it intensity make plain-sight analysis of the null point easy a 'trial and error method be employ here to confirm it position by seek region where the haidinger fringe appear to move in certain direction and by observe the width of the fringe the direction in which they appear to move revers a m1 pas through t 0 and the fringe become considerably -- -+ -- -- -- -- i -- -- -- -- mechanical misalignment be one of the large hindrance in our experiment despite effort to optimise the alignment no confinnation can be make to detennine the quality of this alignment that be to say that the component can not be align mechanically to each other or to some numerical scale therefore there be a random error associate with mechanical alignment and crucially could not be remove or quantify the quality of experimentally produce interferograms be highly sensitive to this alignment so mechanical misalignment of component propagate strongly through into detennined property of a source the experimental method require the use of different source for various stage of the alignment process and also when determine the position of the null point despite our best effort to reduce the physical impact of change light source on the experiment component design especially that of the laser where it have to be screw in meant that some component would be force out of alignment thus it be found that component movement change the position of the null point on the order of several micron therefore it be often necessary to perfonn alignment check between measurement the null point subsequently move and a such it position have be determine frequently during the course of the experiment furthermore it be a necessity iii to remove and replace the move mirror between laboratory session which contribute towards a detrimental effect on the alignment on one occasion the null point move by 3mm hence any discrepancy in position of the null point in figure four and five in addition to this the level of intensity of the utilised source directly affect the clarity of the interference pattern a it becomes less clear with diminish intensity in the instance of the white source and the mercury lamp these source be considerably less intense than the green laser and their design cause some background light to escape in the experiment in spite of our best effort to limit this figure four be an interferogram of the null point use a white lead this demonstrates the aforementioned sensitivity the interference pattern be not symmetrical about the null point equation one suggests this should be exactly symmetrical about the null point another explanation for this asymmetric pattern be that the stage do not move in regular interval relative to it data take rate of j 50h z. this problem be discover during data analysis when it be found that the position record in the data file be not chronological for sequential data thus lead to the conclusion that at small programmed move velocity typically 10-3 mm/ s the motion of the stage be in fact not uniform and could be consider a design fault or the progressive effect of compone nt wear these error be unquantifiable and so their influence on the experiment be undeterminable however reference to figure four and five qualitatively it can be say that it would be significant if present figure five be an interferogram around the null point note the discrepancy in null point position between figure two and three use the mercury discharge lamp asymmetry be again a factor in judging the quality of this interferogram this problem be very clear and despite our attempt at realignment this could not be alleviate figure six the envelope of the wavelength spectral function this gaussian produce a value of λ 545nm which when compare to the true value of 546.1nm show that we be successful in determine a very accurate value 1 use the standard deviation retrieve from this gaussian the full width at half maximum fwhm wavelength spread be calculate a 56nm thus the coherence length be determine use equation four and a value of 5.3µm be determine the value of 5.3µm be two order of magnitude small than the expect value of ≈ 300µm 1 consider figure six the fwhm of the gaussian fit be of the order ten of nanometre which when use with λ in equation four give a result on order micro-metres not hundred of micro-metres a expect therefore consider the accuracy of the measure λ it be the ∆λ spread that be contribute to this greatly inaccurate value this issue therefore be a a result of the quality of the interferogram refer back to figure five there be considerable noise and asymmetry in the interferogram thus it be conclude that despite effort to achieve a satisfactory alignment ultimately it be not achieve and directly affected ∆λ moreover it be assume that this have propagate through the fast fourier transform into the wavelength spectrum and have cause it larger-than-expected width far still the irregularity in stage movement could have contribute to this assume it move with a mean velocity ẋ i.e the same a that programmed the random statistical deviation from this mean could have cause the large ∆λ but the statistic deviation average and cause the spectrum to average to the expect λ. despite determine an accurate value of 545nm for the wavelength of the green line emission from a mercury discharge the greatly inaccurate value of 5.3µm for the coherence length be testament to the imprecision of the alignment intensity of the source and background noise and the irregularity of the stage movement apparatus use to fix the component relative to each other would result in a more precise alignment alternatively some mean of align component relative to angular scale on the optical breadboard would help alleviate this uncertainty a more intense source would act to reduce background noise in the interferogram provide the necessary step be take to ensure minimal background light escape the source into the experiment something we could ultimately not achieve a well quality stage or some other mean of adjust the path length such a implement the mach-zender design could decrease the observe noise in the interferograms,deep,the,65,0.989372194,0.010627806
