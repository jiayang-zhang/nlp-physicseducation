1,GS_MOX979_Redacted,pectroscopy be the study of the spectrum of light and how it change a light interacts with matter a spectrometer be a piece of equipment that allows for the study of spectrum by splitting light base on it wavelength when spectrum be study wavelength intensity and other property of the light beam be measure these property can give insight into anything the light have interact with before enter the spectrometer spectroscopy be use in the study of thing a small a electron to a large a star and be therefore one of the most important field of experimental physic 1 in this report the technique of spectroscopy be employ to check for the presence of the element hydrogen lithium copper and sodium in the sun 's atmosphere establish the chemical composition of star be important a it hold the key to understand star formation prove that this technique work for the sun 's atmosphere open the door for use of the technique on other star or any extrasolar entity that emits a continuous spectrum this could help far the understand of the formation of the universe to find out if one of the previously mention element be present in the sun 's atmosphere the element emission spectrum be first determine the grate spectrometer split light by wavelength and allow for the calculation of prominent wavelength the spectrum of hydrogen be obtain from a hydrogen lamp which excite hydrogen atom into emit light the sodium copper and lithium be all burn in salt form use a blowtorch the sodium and lithium be burn in their `` chloride `` salt form the chlorine require a lot more energy than the blowtorch to emit light and so the spectrum obtain be purely from the metal the same be true for the copper which be burn in it `` sulphate `` form once the spectrum of hydrogen sodium copper and lithium have be determine they be compare to the fraunhofer line these be give to the student by the lab assistant 3 the fraunhofer line be first note in 1802 by wollaston 3 in 1814 fraunhofer who the line be name after start work to determine the wavelength of the line which he label from letter a to k. these line be show in table i. forty-five year after the discovery of the fraunhofer line it be found by kirchoff and bunsen that the line coincide with the emission spectrum of element they theorise that since the light from the sun originates from fusion reaction in it core it must pa through the atmosphere where some wavelength be absorbed by element such a hydrogen this process be discus far in part b of section ii the theory section of this report this process be what cause the dark line to appear in the spectrum of the sun when view from the earth the grate spectrometer investigate fraunhofer line s the diffraction grate produce point of constructive and destructive interference at angle base on the wavelength of the light diffract through the grate a diagram of light travel through a grate can be see in fig 1. note that for an actual grate there be many more beam of light than the two show in fig 1. however by symmetry the light will interfere constructively at the same angle for all beam therefore this diagram can be use to determine the relationship between angle and wavelength a can be see in fig 1 the upper beam will travel a great optical path length than the low beam from trigonometry it can be see that this path difference will be equal to the slit separation multiply by the sine of the diffraction angle for constructive interference the optical path difference must be equal to an integer number of wavelength this give the relationship between the angle for constructive interference and the wavelength of light passing through the grate 𝑚𝜆 𝑑 sin 𝜃 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength in metre 𝑑 be the slit separation in metre this be give by the grate use 𝑚 be the order of the peak 0 for central maximum and then numbered a 1 2 3 … a 𝜃 increase and 𝜃 be the angle with the normal for that peak where constructive interference occurs to calculate the wavelength experimentally the sine of the angle which cause constructive interference can be measure for several peak the angle can then be plot against their peak 's order m the gradient of this relationship will be equal to wavelength divide by the slit separation this give the relationship 2 from 2 we can obtain 𝜆 experimentally use 𝜆 𝑑 × 𝑑 sin 𝜃 𝑑𝑚 3 provide we measure the angle of diffraction at several peak quantum mechanic tell u that an electron can only exist around an atom at certain radius these radius correspond to specific energy the low energy radius be closer to the nucleus of atom for an electron to transition between these energy level it must receive or lose all the energy instantaneously when this happens the electron usually emits or absorbs light a see in fig 2. the energy gap between orbitals vary from element to element this mean that the set of energy require to promote or demote electron in an element be unique to that element from the planck-einstein equation it be know that 𝐸 ℎ𝜈 4 where 𝐸 be the energy of a light wave in joule 𝜈 be the frequency of the light wave in hertz and ℎ be planck 's constant which be approximately 6.63 × 10 −34 𝐽 • 𝑠 from 4 it can be deduce that the wavelength of the light emit or absorbed by an electron be give by 5 where δ𝐸 be the energy difference between the two energy level and c be the speed of light which be approximately 3 × 10 8 𝑚 • 𝑠 −1 it follow from 5 that if every element have a unique set of energy gap then every element will emit and absorb a unique set of wavelength this mean that when electron in atom be demote they will emit light of specific wavelength this be know a an element 's emission spectrum an element 's absorption spectrum can be found by passing a continuous light spectrum through atom of say element the wavelength correspond to energy gap in the atom will be absorbed by the electron this leaf narrow band of low intensity in the result spectrum an element 's absorption and emission spectrum be complementary meaning that the band of low intensity in the absorption spectrum correspond to the band of emit light in the emission spectrum fig 2. two electron be demote to low energy level the energy lose be emit a electromagnetic radiation 1 iii experimental set up fig 3 show the basic part of the grate spectrometer use the spectrometer use for this experiment be the `` pasco sp-9268a `` 2 the grate employ have 2001 line per inch or around 78.78lines per mm 1 this give a slit separation of approximately 1.269 × 10 −5 𝑚. the main angle scale be comprise of separation of half a degree and the vernier read in arc minute to set up the apparatus for this experiment the grate be remove from the holder the eyepiece be then focus onto the crosshair such that it appear on an image 5-10m from the camera this be do in order to reduce eye strain a light source be then pas through the slit the camera be rotate such that the beam of light be centre on the crosshair the collimator be then focus so that a sharp image of the slit appear in the eyepiece the camera 's angle be adjust after focus to ensure that the crosshair be centre on the slit the holder in the kit use could be regulate at any angle relative to the slit for this experiment the holder have to be parallel to the slit to ensure normal incidence on the grate to do this the angle scale be use to rotate the eyepiece 90 degree from the central beam a mirror be place in the grate holder and the turntable be adjust such that grate reflect light from the slit directly into the crosshair on the eyepiece a the camera and the slit be exactly perpendicular it be then know that the mirror and therefore the holder be exactly 45 degree from the beam the scale could then be use to rotate the turntable 45 degree and the telescope 90degrees so that the light take a normal path through the spectrometer the angle on the scale be take a the `` zero `` for the experiment to take reading the light be pas through the slit and the telescope could be rotate such that the crosshair appear on the centre of the slit the angle difference between the `` zero `` angle and the angle on the scale give the value of 𝜃 for that peak a hydrogen lamp be position in front of the slit to obtain the hydrogen alpha wavelength for the metal use a salt be burn next to the slit allow light to pa through the slit the blowtorch be use to burn the metal salt a it burn at very high temperature with little visible light emission when use the blowtorch safety glass be use and the flame be kept far away from any person the data in this experiment be handle in python by the `` scipy `` function `` polyfit `` the `` polyfit `` function allows for a weight factor to be inputted into the parameter for every data point therefore to obtain more accurate value in the gradient the reciprocal of the uncertainty be use a weight factor the uncertainty give in the gradient by python be take a the random error in the final value for the hydrogen lamp the data in table ii be obtain when the hydrogen lamp be place at the slit red and blue line be observe through the lens the red line correspond to the hydrogen- wavelength the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m -6 to m 6 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table ii be plot in python to give the graph in fig 4. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0519  0.0005. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0519 × 1.269 × 10 −5 6 6.58 x 10^-7m fig 3. the grate spectrometer the light pas through the slit and then becomes parallel after passing through the collimator the grate the diffracts the light where it can be focus and view through the camera and eyepiece the diffraction angle can be read off the turntable if the camera/eyepiece be rotate such that the diffraction beam be centre on the crosshair the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃. to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.94 this give an absolute error of around ±6𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 658 ± 6 𝑛𝑚 this value corresponds to fraunhofer line c which have a wavelength of 656.6nm this result be strong evidence for the presence of hydrogen in the atmosphere of the sun in order to more thoroughly check for the presence of hydrogen the wavelength of hydrogen- and hydrogen- could be determine if they be found in the fraunhofer line then this would prove to a much high certainty that the fraunhofer line be cause by light absorption from element in the sun 's atmosphere and that hydrogen be one of them for the sodium chloride salt the data in table iii be obtain when the sodium chloride be burn next to the slit orange line be see through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be again approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m -4 to m 4 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table iii be plot in python to give the graph in fig 5. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0465  0.0003. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0465 × 1.269 × 10 −5 7 5.90 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.71 this give an absolute error of around ±4𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 590 ± 4 𝑛𝑚 this value corresponds to fraunhofer line d which be a doublet of wavelength of 589nm and 589.6nm this result would suggest that there be likely to be a presence of sodium in the sun 's atmosphere although the fraunhofer line have a doublet of wavelength only one be see in the spectrometer if a high resolution spectrometer be use then the presence of two line could be confirm to give the best possible chance of see two line with the apparatus use several change could be make a brighter sodium lamp could be use instead of a flame a this will produce a more reliable spectrum a bright lamp would also allow for a small slit which would decrease the overlap of the two line decrease the slit space would also spread the spectrum more make the two wavelength more distinct for the copper sulphate salt the data in table iv be obtain when the copper sulphate be burn the light emit be diffuse and not very bright the light see through the lens be very spread out meaning the collimator may not have be able to make all the light beam parallel the error from the width of the peak and the parallax error be much large than for the other three at 40 arc minute peak from m -5 to m 5 be visible through the eyepiece the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃. to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 40 ′ ≈ 0.9428° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃. to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero the data from table iv be plot in python to give the graph in fig 6. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0420  0.0017. from 3 we find 𝜆=0.042× 1.269 ×10−5 8 5.33 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 4.06 this give an absolute error of around ±20𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 530 ± 20 𝑛𝑚 the range of copper wavelength do correspond to fraunhofer line e which have a wavelength of 527nm however the uncertainty in the wavelength be too high to be certain that the wavelength of copper match with this line also due to what be know about star formation it be unlikely that there be high amount of copper in the sun 's atmosphere a repeat of this experiment would require a more accurate way of get the emission spectrum of copper for example burning a more flammable salt with a large flame a more sophisticated spectrometer could also be use for the lithium salt the data in table v be obtain when the lithium salt be burn next to the slit a red line be observe through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute .. peak from m -4 to m 4 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table v be plot in python to give the graph in fig 7. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0528  0.0005. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0528 × 1.269 × 10 −5 6 6.71x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.99 this give an absolute error of around ±7𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 671 ± 7 𝑛𝑚 this value do not correspond to any fraunhofer line suggest little presence of lithium in the sun 's atmosphere it would seem odd that little lithium can be found in the sun 's atmosphere a it should be more easily fuse than for example sodium although the technique give good result for hydrogen and sodium the spectrum of lithium should be checked use a different method in order to verify that the wavelength measure be correct the aim of this experiment be to determine the wavelength of the element hydrogen sodium copper and lithium and to compare these to the fraunhofer line in order to determine the chemical composition of the sun 's atmosphere the wavelength found be hydrogen -𝜆 658 ± 6 𝑛𝑚 copper -𝜆 530 ± 20 𝑛𝑚 lithium -𝜆 671 ± 7 𝑛𝑚 when compare to the fraunhofer line it be found that hydrogen and sodium be present in the solar atmosphere copper and lithium be not found in the solar atmosphere however more experimentation should be carry out before this be know for certain the result from this experiment show that it be possible to determine the chemical composition of distant object through analysis of their spectrum this could be use to check for the presence of the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃 the measurement itself and the `` zero angle `` to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero every element not only on the sun but also on other star in our galaxy,superficial,bal,72,0.0451773,0.954822659,Understand the difference  - to get an idea of what topic 0 and topic 1 is.,,,,
2,GS_WHP087_Redacted,this experiment be conduct to determine the rydberg constant by use the emission spectrum of hydrogen lamp in the experiment light emit by hydrogen lamp be diffract into bright fringe and be observe through a grate spectrometer fringe with three colour red green and purple be observe for each colour the diffraction angle and order of maximum be measure and be use to determine the wavelength wavelength of each colour and their correspondent initial and final energy level be then use to calculate the rydberg constant the value calculate with the red light be 11161664.7±40600.2𝑚 −1 the value calculate with the blue light be 10956139.2±51453.5𝑚 −1 and the value calculate with the purple light be 10773444.4±12520.1𝑚 −1 atom emit light with discrete wavelength due to electron movement but light be mixed so that color can not be observe through a diffraction grate light with different wave length have different diffraction angle which separate light by their wavelength so that wavelength of emit light can be measure wavelength of light emit by an atom be call emission spectrum it be in 1855 that the emission spectrum line of hydrogen atom be precisely measure by j. j. balmer and lyman it be found to be regular and conclude into an equation call balmer equation by the former the equation be an empirical formula which show that the wavelength of the emit light by a hydrogen atom be related to 1/𝑛 2 where n be any positive integer great than 3. and the equation be developed by rydberg into rydberg equation which be consist with a wider range of spectrum over next few decade and rydberg constant be therefore introduce to fit the equation but the meaning of the equation the constant and the emission spectrum still could not be interpret until the establishment of bohr model of hydrogen atom bohr explain that the emission of light be due to the transition of electron 's energy level and the energy of emit photon equal to the change in electron 's potential energy since energy level of electron be quantize the atom can only release light with certain wave length and the rydberg constant be later deduce by bohr use his model and plank 's photon theory with 0.05 percent of error which be interpret because of the atom movement in this experiment emission spectrum of hydrogen lamp be measure through grate spectrometer and the rydberg constant be calculate figure 1 1 spectrometer theory with light passing through grate in spectrometer principal maximum occurs when light that go through all slit have instruction interference which be to say that light passing through every slit have a phase difference of 2nπ with the light passing through the neighbor slit where n be any integer δ𝜙 2𝑛𝜋 1 where δ𝜙 be phase difference between two light wave which can be also express a δ𝑟 be denote a path difference and 𝜆 be wavelength the path difference can be farther express a where d be the separation between slit which be where n be number of slit per meter and 𝜃 be diffraction angle therefore and n represent order of maximum which be to say from equation 5 it can be told that light with different wavelength have different diffraction angle therefore a mixture of light with different wavelength can be separate through a grate and wavelength of each light can be determine by the linear relationship between diffraction angle and order of maximum a mention before rydberg equation describes the relationship between the wavelength of emit light and the correspondent change in energy level in hydrogen atom accord to bohr 's equation for energy level the total energy of an electron be and plank 's photon theory the photon energy be where 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of electron e be charge per electron and n be energy level of the electron the photon energy should equal the change in energy level therefore where n and p be final and initial energy level the equation can be rearrange into which mean where r be call rydberg constant figure 2 2 grate spectrometer the grate spectrometer be set up and calibrate by several step the telescope be first focus around 1 meter far the adjustable slit be then narrow a sodium lamp be place in front of the slit the telescope be adjust so that the crosswire inside the telescope be align with the slit the telescope then be turn exactly 90 degree by the vernier angular scale and clamped and a diffraction grate with 78.8 line per meter be set on the turn table the turntable be rotate until the crosswire of the telescope be again align with the fringe of the slit from the reflection of the grate then the telescope be unclamped and rotate exactly 90 degree back the turn table be rotate exactly 45 degree and clamped the reading on vernier scale be record a central angle 𝜃 0 which for this experiment be 96.17 degree turn the telescope the fringe of sodium lamp light can then be observe through the telescope the sodium lamp be then replace by a hydrogen lamp turn the telescope red green and purple fringe be observe for fringe with each color the rotation angle show by the vernier meter and order of maximum be record and for each fringe the width be measure a the error there should be more color but be unobservable 1. for date of each color the fit line between order of maximum and the sine function of change in rotation angle to central angle 𝜃

3,GS_NPG050_Redacted,"the aim of the experiment be to measure the spectrum of vaporise hydrogen from a hydrogen lamp and determine the wavelength of the spectral line use this we calculate the rydberg constant for each spectral line and found an average and take the standard error the final value of the rydberg constant we obtain be 1.092x10 7 ± 3.180x10 4 m -1 this be a highly precise experiment generate a percentage error of only 0.291 the set up consists of a simple spectrometer with a 78.8 lines/mm diffraction grate and a hydrogen lamp the spectrometer can measure in the vernier scale the small increment of measurement be 1 arcminute we measure the angle at which each order of the spectral line appear after be diffract and plot a sin angle against order graph to determine the wavelength of the spectral line the wavelength be then use with rydberg formula to determine the constant spectrometry be a technique of use em radiation and in specific case also use the mass of an ion and magnetic field to determine the structure or the composition of a material or an object diffract light from a material or the amount of ion deflection in a magnetic field be analyse 1 in our experiment we be focus on the emission spectrum of hydrogen gas a a potential difference v across the filament in the hydrogen lamp be apply the gas be heat and cause the atom to be excite the electron in the atom be promote to a high energy level and then fall to a low energy level energy equivalent to the difference in the energy level be release in the form of a photon 2 the energy level be fix and so only photon with discrete wavelength be release therefore each element or compound have a unique spectral pattern in this experiment we be observe the balmer series in hydrogen this be to say we be look at wavelength of photon generate from an electron transition from a high level n=3,4,5… to energy level p=2 this produce photon in the visible spectrum this can be see in the rydberg formula give by eq 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 𝑛 be the energy level high than 2 and 𝑝 be the 2 nd energy level 3 the light in the spectrometer can diffract through a diffraction grate the wavelength of each spectral line can be determine by the diffraction formula give by eq 2 where ⅆ be the distance between the slit in the diffraction grate 𝜃 be the angle at which the order appear in radian 𝑚 be the order at which the spectral line appear where m 0 ±1 ±2 etc and 𝜆 be the wavelength pf the spectral line 4 the central order m =0 will appear at 𝜃 =0 at the central order all the spectral line will be overlap the set up consists of a simple spectrometer with a 78.8 lines/mm diffraction grate and a sodium or hydrogen lamp the set up can be see in fig 1. sodium lamp be use to ready the spectrometer a it produce high intensity light and have a longer operational time than the hydrogen lamp however the sodium lamp do take some time about 2 minute to reach maximum intensity it have a manageable warm up time this overall make the set up of the spectrometer much easy a time can be take to make fine adjustment the disadvantage of use a hydrogen lamp instead of shin light through a vial of vaporise hydrogen and measure an absorption spectrum be that lamp only remains bright enough to make measurement of the low wavelength light for about 10 minute it also only have an operational time of 20 minute this meant that the measurement have to make quickly this however be still more manageable than the alternate method of produce the hydrogen spectrum a the light emit through the hydrogen may have it own spectrum this may lead to confusion when analyse the overall spectrum the sodium lamp be set up in front of the slit and the slit be narrow the intensity of light from the sodium lamp be high and the narrow slit provide a high resolution of the spectral line the resolution be the ability to separate two spectral line and see them discretely the spectral line be then focus use the focus nob the spectral line be ensure to be vertical by place a filter that block some light and turn the line into small dot it be important to ensure that the spectral line be vertical so that the angle measure be in a plane that be perpendicular to the line the filter be make by cut a triangle in a black square card it be position in front of the slit and adjust until the line appear to be dot the filter be then taped on to the slit securely hold it in position the head of the spectrometer be rotate from left to right and we observe if the crosshair pas through the centre of the dot if the crosshair do n't then the stand hold the diffraction grate be adjust use the 3 level screw until it do the filter be then remove a diagram of the filter can be see in fig 2 the diffraction grate be also place such that it be perpendicular to the slit and lens array in front of the lamp preliminary data of the order and angle at which the order appear be make use the sodium lamp here we notice that it be best to make measurement by rotate the head in one direction ie go from m= -4 to m=4 rather than start at the m=0 and change direction after reach the high order this be because change direction occasionally cause the spectrometer to shift a it be not fix to the table finally we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be place such that it be closer to the slit and the centre of the lamp face the slit the centre of the lamp be the brightest part of it the slit be also make to be a bit wider than before this allow more light into the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp be dimmer than the sodium lamp this however decrease the resolution of the spectral line the spectrometer be refocus and measurement be make first we slowly move from the 0 th order a this be the easy to identify to the -4 th order which we define to be in the clockwise direction then we measure the angle at which the red spectral line appear make sure to keep the crosshair in the centre of the line this be do by use the fine adjustment screw locate on the base we then measure the angle of the subsequent order of the red line until we reach m +4 we then repeat the same technique with the blue and purple line the observe spectral pattern of hydrogen can be see in fig 3 and the data of the angle of each order for each spectral line can be see in appendix a. a see in fig 3 the pattern also contains a rainbow artefact this be due to light from the surround enter the spectrometer if the experiment be do in perfectly dark condition then this pattern would not be see",superficial,bal,64,0.078393534,0.921606421,,,,,

77,GS_XMC918_Redacted,the uncertainty in the measurement of each angle be estimate simply by take several reading of each maximum and compare them to find a range the uncertainty use for each data point be then half the total range which be found to be 1/6 of a degree source of systematic error be mostly not possible for u to measure in the time available so for example we do not obtain enough measurement of maximum to both side of the centre to compare them and as how much error may be arise from slight asymmetry in the alignment of the spectrometer instead the result here be base on measurement just to one side of the centre and this error can not be quantify similarly other potential source of error such a atmospheric condition affect the optical property of the air and therefore alter the wavelength due to a potential change in the speed of light be not account for a these condition i.e humidity air pressure be not measure when the experiment be be carry out furthermore a other work be be do in the lab variation in background light could not be avoid meaning some data point may have underestimated uncertainty if background light be high when the measurement be take specifically to the setup we use the spectrometer be balance on a table which do not perfectly sit flat on the table we attempt to prevent it wobble while we make our measurement by place some paper under one of the leg but this do not seem to fully remedy the problem so it may have create some random error if it be not in exactly the same position for all the measurement the result we be able to obtain include only two wavelength of the balmer series a low wavelength be not visible with the set up use the two correspond to n value of 3 for the red light and 4 for the blue violet light which we assume to correspond to n=5 be visible only to the first maximum and so we be unable to gather enough data point to calculate a precise value for it wavelength and other colour be not visible at all a show in fig 2 and 3 the data fit extremely well to a linear relationship a predict by our model this allow u to calculate value for the wavelength of 6614762x10 -13 +/-7x10 -13 m for the red light and 47739x10 -11 +/-1x10 -11 m for the blue use 2 the mean value of the rydberg constant obtain from 3 be 11028400+/-100m -1 this do not agree with the accepted value of 10973731.6m -1 which would suggest that systematic error in the experiment have a significant impact however consider the individual value for the two different colour the red light give a value approximately 1 low than the accepted value while the blue light give one approximately 2 high rather than support the idea that it be cause by systematic error it instead implies that the problem be that random error be underestimated the most likely candidate for this phenomenon be the unstable table on which the spectrometer be balance mention in section iii it would explain why the two data set show very little error within themselves and yet the two data set both conflict with both one another and the accepted value it be possible that other source of error played their part such a background light and atmospheric condition however it seem less likely that these would have give such a clear divide between the two data set the unstable table would be more likely a the data set be take very close together give limited time for such a distinct change in humidity or pressure also background light fluctuate throughout the experiment with no chance of give such a distinct contrast in the two set of reading another contribution to the error in our result be likely not accounting for possible asymmetry in our set up by only measure to one side of the centre it be possible that if we have do so we would have notice the effect of the unstable table and have a chance of quantify the resultant error instead we be left with no way of state with any certainty whether this or another unidentified source of error lead to the issue in our final value use our method we be able to obtain a value for the rydberg constant which fell within 1 of the accepted value however a we underestimated the systematic error inherent in our set up our value conflict with the accepted value despite be so close in order to make it a useful measurement we would need to return to the experiment and thoroughly investigate and quantify the impact of all potential source of systematic error described in section iii once this be do it would be possible to both more confidently state which source of error cause the issue in this experiment and to repeat the experiment with well control and understand of these error to obtain a more accurate value of the rydberg constant another improvement that could likely give a significant increase in the accuracy and precision achievable would be if extra wavelength could be observe to increase the amount of data available this could be achieve either by change the source to one in which low wavelength be brighter and could be measure another possibility be to use other method of observation than the naked eye allow infra-red ultra violet or both to be observe in addition once again this would simply increase the amount of data available to use in calculation thereby reduce statistical error and give a more precise final

78,GS_BMS328_Redacted,where r be the rydberg constant and be approximately equal to 1.097x10 7 m -1 and n1 and n2 be integer value and be equivalent to the initial and final state the rydberg constant can also be express a r ømc 2h where ø be the fine structure constant a dimensionless quantity 6 m be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be plank 's constant another important piece of theory to consider be the balmer series the balmer series be a series of line from the hydrogen emission spectrum cause by electron fall from the nth energy level to the principle quantum number 2 7 for instance the transition from energy level 3 to energy level 2 will appear red on the em spectrum 4- 2 will appear cyan in colour and transition 5- 2 will appear blue 8 use the balmer series therefore allows u to optically record and measure the diffraction scatter a 4 of the transition of n appear in the visible spectrum figure 2 illustrates different type of emission and absorption series include the balmer series it be clear to see that those transition in the lyman series will need considerably more energy to be able to transition to the other n band all the line in the lyman series be in the ultraviolet band and thus be not suitable for our investigation 10 the other series adjacent to the balmer series be the paschen series these transition will have less energy than the balmer transition and thus all the paschen line lie in the infrared band 11 a you move through the series the rate at which the wavelength increase decrease until you reach the convergence limit of the series this be in effect the energy need to ionize the hydrogen atom the figure below illustrates the most important part of the set up two type of discharge lamp be use in this investigation be compose of hydrogen and sodium the sodium lamp be use for the calibration of the spectrometer whereas the hydrogen lamp be use for the actual record the sodium lamp initially emit lilac light and then turn to an orange colour the hydrogen lamp use in this experiment produce a lot of heat which would significantly affect the operation time thus the hydrogen lamp be only use for the record whereas the sodium lamp could operate for long period of time this become one of the key consideration a all measurement would have to be take before the lamp overheat this would require an efficient way of record result after the source we have the slit ideally the slit should be a narrow a possible to make the angle measurement a precise a possible another part of the fix spectrometer be the collimator a collimator essentially produce a beam of parallel ray which be useful for when you want the wave to converge on the same focal point the grate use in this investigation have 300 line per mm the logic behind use a diffraction grate with more slit be the fact that these extra slit would reinforce the diffraction pattern make them more visible especially at the high order 13 the set up of the spectrometer be a lengthy one however this get easy over time the set up begin with the focus of the eyepiece on the crosswire this be do from about 5 meter ideally this should be do from an infinite distance 14 in this case a lamp on the other desk be focus on one consideration be to keep both eye open whilst focus the camera now the telescope have to be align with the axis of the collimator this could be do by very slightly opening the slit with the sodium lamp fully lit behind it now once the collimator be perfectly align with the telescope use the slow-motion drive on the side of the spectrometer stage the collimator be focus until a sharp image appear the cross wire be rotate by π 4 to ensue that the alignment of the stage could be a precise a possible carefully record the angle at which the main stage be rotate and the angle present on the two main scale be an essential part of the experiment a precision be require the main stage be initially move to an angle of 59.5 degree and 2 arc minute two arc minute be the equivalent of .03 of a degree it become essential to be able to quickly convert these reading of arc minute into the more useful degree now the telescope have to be move through exactly 90 degree it be very helpful to get a second opinion on the angle measurement and reach a consensus then the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit on the grate come from the collimator be see this should be at 45 degree to the normal of the spectrometer additionally the use of a mirror to double check the reflection from the collimator prove very useful the reading on the scale must be take down in the case of our set up the reading come out a 68 degree and 20 arc minute now the grate stage must be firmly fix to the main fine motor and this whole set up be move through 45 degree so that the grate be at the normal incidence when the grate stage be in place the grate stage can be move by turn 3 different screw which adjust the height of the main stage to ensure that when move through the angle of 6 figure 2 9 figure 3 12 observation all spectral line can be observe this can be checked by simply observe the spectral line through large angle of incidence and adjust appropriately in a more practical sense the stage be control by 3 screw a it be the most stable configuration a mathematically 3 point determine a plane so any more or less than this would be much less stable 15 when the camera and eye piece be move to the zero order the angular scale read 203 degree and 10 arc minute now the sodium lamp could be replace by the hydrogen lamp and data be record a range of 4 th to -4 th order be measure a a large spread of data would give the best possible set of data in addition to this a second opinion be always utilized a this would give a value of uncertainty value for 3 discrete wavelength emission be record and with these a graph of sinθ against order be plot from the gradient of this straight line plot a value for λ can be obtain the error bar on these graph come from the difference in the two measurement take of the same emission line an error of the gradient can also be show on python with this information and the understand of which wavelength be cause by which transmission the value obtain can be substitute into equation 5 with n1=2 to find the rydberg constant error bar be very small with only reading from the -2 nd 1 st and 2 nd order have an associate error this mean that both measurement from two different people be the same for most record result with this transition the uncertainty of the slope be slightly high than expect due to a minor spread in result at the -1 st and 3 rd order the straight line be expect to pa through the origin and the fact that the error do not cover the actual intercept record must mean an unknown source of error the uncertainty in the slope be considerably small than transition 3 to 2 and simply from observation all the point lie very close to the line once again the line almost pas through the origin and lie outside of the calculate error error bar on this graph be large for order -3 -1 and 2. uncertainty for the slope be even high than for the transition from 3 to 2. the most obvious thing about this plot be the fact that only +/-2 order be measure this be because the intensity of these order be too low to be measure use the human eye also notice that the error bar increase in size a the order increase this could be due to the change in intensity make any kind of measurement subjective if more than one person be use to record the angle once again the line of best fit almost pas through the origin this could be down to systematic error for which there be plenty in this experiment with this information the rydberg constant can be calculate for all 3 transition v. analysis and error from the data 2 of the 3 calculate value give a value for the rydberg constant that lay within the associate error those be the one obtain from the red and blue transition the value associate with the cyan transition have such a small calculate error that it do not pa through the actual value for the rydberg constant a the line be so uniform and without blemish the error must be systematic now if a mean of all 3 value be take you find it give a value of 1.11x10 7 if the actual value of the rydberg constant be give to be 1.097x10 7 then the associate percentage error be 1.19 the standard deviation between all 3 value be 1.34x10 5 which give a standard error of +/-77365 this once again lie outside of the range of the actual value if transition 4 to 2 be take away and just the other two be consider we get a mean of 1.097x10 7 of course more than two piece of information be need to be able to establish a constant of some sort however this be still encourage it be clear to see that systematic error come into play when the cyan spectrum band be measure one possibility be that since background light be all around during the procedure it be entirely possible that background spectral line be measure and record instead of the one from the hydrogen emission spectrum lightbulb produce a continuous spectrum a continuous spectrum be one which all wavelength be present and there be no gap 16 alternatively the error could 've come from a misalignment of the spectrometer for all three of these discrete transition wavelength the set up be realign and return to the central maximum at the normal to the grate it be entirely possible that during the reset of the spectrometer the diffraction grate may have move within the slide or the grate stage may have move to some degree the fact that this transition be measure last may suggest why this be the only graph affected by such systematic error general source of error be hugely dependent on the quality of the set up for instance the dimension of the slit when measure the emission line work two way one way be to keep the slit a narrow a possible and get result with optimum precision but fail to measure the high order which lack intensity or keep the slit slightly wider which would reduce the precision however a well spread of result would be obtain in the case of this set up the slit be left a little bit wider so that for at least two of the line 4 order could be measure it be impossible to say what uncertainty this compromise have however it be most likely very small and can be ignore another possible source could be from the measurement of angle whilst calibrate the instrument each time an angle be measure it have an uncertainty of +/-0.0083 degree now throughout the set up the angle be measure 3 time not include the actual measurement if add in quadrature this lead to an error of +/-0.014 degree this may sound small but it be the equivalent of almost a whole arc minute in addition the measurement of an angle have 2 angle uncertainty so in total that give an angle uncertainty of +/-0.019 degree this be a very small uncertainty equivalent to just over 1 arc minute this assumes that every measurement be take to the near arc minute whereas on occasion a second opinion can give a completely different measurement over all of the measurement take it be found that the average uncertainty a a result of disagreement be 0.28 of an arc minute this be a surprisingly low uncertainty for angle measurement if we take this alone other uncertainty be difficult to calculate a they be either assumption or they be too difficult to compute without specialist equipment in conclusion despite the fact that the value obtain lie outside of the predict uncertainty this set up and experiment should be deem a a successful one due to the fact that a good value be obtain and a very slight unaccountable systematic error be so frequent for this kind of set up the error calculate must be below the true error of the experiment the fact that a percentage error of only 1.19 be obtain show the success and the validity of the experiment even though a slightly low percentage difference be expect due to the sophistication of the instrument it can still be say that the rydberg constant be calculate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and this be especially the case for transition 3 to 2 and 5 to 2 a the rydberg constant lie within their error range a. transition,extended,bal,62,0.959983349,0.040016621,,,,,

to determine whether these emission line should be treat a one or a two slightly separate emission line for this point they be treat a one thus increase the emission line width and therefore the uncertainty in the measurement of θ. these data give a wavelength of 654.7 ± 0.2 nm and hence n 3. a value for the rydberg constant r∞ be calculate a 1.0997 ± 0.0004 × 10 7 m −1 the accepted value of

estimate uncertainty line since hydrogen do not have an orange colour emission line this line be measure and a wavelength of 587.5 ± 0.3 nm be record the data for this line be outline in figure 10. the origin of this orange emission line be unknown perhaps it originate from some out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp due to the high temperature inside although this do seem very unlikely an experiment study the emission spectrum of nacl solution flame test have be carry out with the equipment before this data run have be carry out although this do not seem to have affected

588.9950954 ± 0.0000015 nm 5 data from the first run be less precise and also less accurate than data from the second run furthermore the uncertainty for the measurement take in the first run be clearly large in magnitude than the uncertainty for the measurement take in the second run the reason for this be unknown however it be hypothesise that the stark difference in each data set 's accuracy be due to the alignment of the spectrometer before the data be collect during the alignment process for the first run of the experiment explain in section iii when the grate be turn by precisely 45 • such that it be meant to be at 90 • to the centre line it be clearly not this perplexed u and the alignment process be attempt again upon repeat the alignment process the grate be still not perfectly align however we attempt to continue with the experiment for the second run the same issue occur again however this time the effect be much less pronounce although the grate do not seem to be at exactly 90 • to the centre line of the collimator the hypothesis be the data from the first run be less accurate more spread out because the spectrometer be more misalign whereas the data from the second run be more accurate less spread out because the spectrometer be less misalign in this experiment the rydberg constant for hydrogen be calculate a 1.1004 ± 0.0004 × 10 7 m −1 use angle measurement take with a grate spectrometer a hydrogen vapour lamp be use a the light source in order to observe fig 11. all of the calculate value for the rydberg constant value from run 1 have a large spread than those from run 2. also the value from run 1 have much wider uncertainty than from run 2 run 2 use the in/out method whereas run 1 do not average mean be take of the calculate value for run 1 run 2 and for all of the value these value be also plot alongside the individual emission line calculation for reference the accepted value for r∞ have be plot 1.09737316 × 10 7 m −1 1 the accepted value for r∞ do not lie within any of the range define by the calculate value uncertainty the emission spectrum of hydrogen use the equipment the experiment be run twice since a novel method for determine the centre of the emission line observe be developed after the first run of the experiment be complete the data from the first run be much less accurate and precise than those of the second run and this be clearly visible in figure 11. hence a the mean of the second data run be much more precise and accurate than that of the first this be select a the final value for the rydberg constant a calculate in this experiment unusually during data collection for the second repeat of the experiment an orange emission line be observe in the emission spectrum of hydrogen there do not exist an orange colour emission line the wavelength of this emission line be measure a 587.5 ± 0.3 nm confirm it a originate from sodium in a previous experiment use the same equipment the wavelength of the emission line from a sodium vapour lamp be record a 587.7 ± 0.4 nm and the wavelength of the emission line from a flame test of a nacl solution be record a 587.6 ± 0.4 nm the origin of this emission line be unknown a possible explanation could be out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp although this do seem to be an unlikely scenario for this experiment a visual grate spectrometer be use to make the measurement other spectrometer design exist such a a computer-aided grate spectrometer in which the eyepiece be replace with a detector array usually a ccd or cmos sensor the benefit of use a computer-aided spectrometer over a visual grate spectrometer have already be investigate 6 in this investigation it be found that there be no significant improvement or reduction in the uncertainty of the measurement when use a computer-aided spectrometer thus this experiment would not be improve through this suggestion however if the experiment be to be repeat again much more care should be take in align the spectrometer when carry out this experiment the spectrometer do not appear perfectly align before the first data set be record before the second data set be record the spectrometer be align much more carefully however the alignment be still not perfect it be hypothesise that the misalignment of the spectrometer explains the difference in accuracy between the two separate run of the experiment in order to far reduce the error in measure the angle of the maximum in the spectrum a diffraction grate with a high number of lines/mm could have be use such that the angle separate the order of the spectrum would be large thus the uncertainty in determine the small change in the angle on the vernier scale would have be far reduce combine with the `` in/out `` method of measurement developed the uncertainty could be reduce to an even well range more repetition of the experiment could improve the final mean value take for r ∞ a long a the spectrometer be correctly align when carry out the experiment it be important to make detailed note on the alignment procedure so that during data analysis it be possible to notice any issue that may

1,2ndINT_AAN562_Redacted,michelson interferometer be construct and use to obtain the interferograms of various light source namely a white lead a tungsten source and a mercury vapor lamp a fast fourier transform be later perform on these interferograms to obtain the spectrum of these light source use this spectroscopy method we determine the characteristic a well a composition of the light source which we investigate the white lead and tungsten source be observe to be light source with continuous wavelength spectrum while the mercury lamp source emit light at discrete wavelength these observation be consistent with the physic behind the emission of light from the source lead 's have energy band within them while a tungsten source behaves a a black body radiation emitter and the mercury lamp emits light through atomic transition the michelson interferometer prove to be precise in examine the light source although there be a few limitation and source of error due to the restriction of equipment and compute power with improvement to the equipment and more compute power the michelson interferometer could be use for more advanced application such a high resolution spectroscopy i nterferometry be a method of superimpose wave upon one another to create an interference pattern from which information can be obtain a famous experiment in which interferometry be use be the 'failed michelson-morley experiment from which light be proven to have a constant speed in all frame and from which the foundation of einstein 's postulate of special relativity could be laid the interferometer when combine with fourier transforms essentially becomes a spectrometer this be a very powerful technique that allows u to obtain and study the spectrum of light source with this method we could for example analyse the spectrum of astronomical body and predict their composition 2 in this experiment a michelson interferometer be construct and use to obtain the interference pattern or interferograms of several light source fast fourier transforms be then apply to the interferograms to obtain the spectrum of the light source which we then use to study the characteristic of the light source the layout of the michelson interferometer be show in fig 1. a light source emits light which be split into two beam when incident upon the beam splitter the two beam be then reflect by mirror m1 and m2 back into the beam splitter where they recombine and be direct towards a photodetector which measure the intensity of the recombine light beam in the michelson interferometer the beam splitter consists of a dielectric plate which induces a phase change of π 2 on one of the beam assume a monochromatic light source of wavelength λ there be destructive interference between the two recombine beam when the path difference between the beam be zero or an integer multiple of λ and constructive interference occurs when the path difference be an odd integer multiple of λ 2 the two type of interference be record by the photodetector a dark low intensity and bright high intensity fringe respectively hence if we be to vary the position of either mirror m1 or m2 we could produce an interference pattern about a null point the point at which the path difference be zero and the light wave interfere destructively 1 nyquist 's theorem nyquist 's theorem state that in order to retain sufficient information from an original waveform the sample rate of a detector should be at least twice the frequency of the incident wave in term of the distance the sample distance can be at most half the wavelength of the incident wave therefore the rate at which the position of the mirror be varied should be such that we fulfil the condition of the nyquist theorem so we can obtain accurate interferograms and spectrum of the light source 2 b. fourier transform spectroscopy perform a fourier transform on an interferogram of a wave give u the spectrum of frequency or wavelength for the wave depend on the measurement take the obtain interferogram and spectrum of a wave allows u to analyse the characteristic of the wave a well a the characteristic of the wave source one significant characteristic we can observe from the interferogram and the spectrum of a light wave be the width a explain in fig 2. fig 2. the fourier transform of a narrow gaussian spectrum result in a broad interferogram and vice versa an inverse fourier transform can instead be perform on the interferogram a well follow the same forementioned principle adapt from 1 we can determine from the width of the interferogram and the spectrum of a light wave the composition of the light wave for example a light wave of a very discrete wavelength such a a laser beam would have an interferogram with a large width and a narrow spectrum while a light wave comprise light of multiple wavelength would have a narrow interferogram and a broad spectrum the interferometer be set up a show in 3. all component be secure into the metal table with placeholder a monochromatic green laser be then use for the initial alignment of the interferometer by ensure the laser beam reflect off the 2 mirror be superimpose on each other this be make easy use the 10.0 mm and 2.5 mm lens a white lead be later use a well a move the mirror at a constant speed to determine the null point of the interferometer a fringe pattern for white light could only be observe around the null point a ground glass diffuser be use to increase the dispersion of the white light once the null point be determine up to an accuracy of ±0.001mm we then measure and obtain interferograms from light source about the null point give that the photodetector have a sample rate of 50 hz and that the light source in our investigation have a range of wavelength from 400 to 800 nanometre the speed of the motor be set at a default of 0.001 mm s −1 give a sample distance of 20 nanometre which be well below half the minimum wavelength of the light source under investigation satisfy the condition of the nyquist theorem we then proceed to obtain and investigate the interferograms of the white lead tungsten source and mercury lamp source a significant source of error be the inconsistency of the motor on which the translatable mirror be instal possible imperfection in the motor cause the mirror to move at a speed which be not constant which lead to error when perform fast fourier transforms on the obtain interferograms to determine the spectrum of the investigate light wave another significant source of error be the limitation of the fft perform by the computer a it be a very basic program which simply allow u to extract the spectrum of a light source from it interferogram.further possible source of error include misalignment of equipment due to knock on the metal platform for the interferometer a well a filth on the mirror or lens these error be dealt with by cleaning the lens a well a handle the equipment with great care throughout the experiment the position of the null point be also measure again whenever there be a misalignment in the interferometer setup the obtain interferogram for the white lead be show in fig 4. we observe a narrow interferogram a expect since white light be a combination of light of different wavelength over a broad spectrum however the interferogram appear to be asymmetric which be uncharacteristic of white light a it should be approximate a a dirac delta function upon perform an fft on the interferogram we find that the spectrum of the white lead a show in fig 5 deviate significantly from the expect trend we observe from this deviation that the white lead emits light comprise the spectrum of blue and yellow light the combination of which the human eye perceives a white light the obtain result agree with the band theory of lead a hole and electron from the `` p-side `` and `` n-side `` recombine energy be release in the form of photon which have a continuous range of energy due to the energy band within the semiconductor diode this continuous range of photon energy translates into the continuous wavelength spectrum we observe from the white lead 3 the interferogram of the tungsten source be show in fig 6. the tungsten source be turn on and left until it heat up to a constant temperature before measurement be take the interferogram of the tungsten source be almost a narrow line give rise to the explanation that the tungsten source emits a continuous spectrum of light a show in it fft fig 7. we observe that the spectrum of tungsten can almost be approximate a a smooth gaussian curve this be consistent with the physical explanation that tungsten emits blackbody radiation when heat up lead to the observe continuous spectrum the measure spectrum of mercury be show in fig 8 with the spectrum for the green and yellow filter plot on the same graph we find that the spectrum of mercury have many discrete peak with significant peak around the green 530-560 nm and yellow 560-590 region in contrast to the previous investigate light source we find that the mercury vapor lamp emits light of discrete wavelength which be consistent with the physical model of mercury emit light through it electronic transition between different state a each electron in an atom can only occupy discrete energy level a a current be pas through a body of mercury vapor the atomic electron become excite and move into a high energy level before be de-excited and move back to it original energy level a they fall back to it original state the excitation energy be release in the form of photon which now have a discrete wavelength due to the discrete electronic energy level 4 although not reflect clearly in the compute fft spectrum due to the limitation of the fft program the visible green and yellow light wave emit by the mercury vapor lamp have very specific wavelength 546.075 nm green 576.961 nm yellow and 579.067 nm yellow 5 upon far investigation we be able to observe consistent beating in the interferogram of the mercury vapor lamp when the yellow filter be fix on fig 9 this prof the existence of the yellow doublet in mercury 's atomic spectrum we construct and configure a michelson interferometer to obtain the interferograms of a white lead a tungsten source and a mercury vapor lamp a fast fourier transform be then perform on these interferograms to obtain the spectrum of the light source we be then able to investigate the characteristic a well a composition of the light source the white lead and tungsten source be observe to be light source with continuous wavelength spectrum while the mercury lamp source emit light at discrete wavelength these observation be consistent with the physic behind the emission of light from the source lead 's have energy band within them while a tungsten source behaves a a black body radiation emitter and the mercury lamp emits light thorugh atomic transition the michelson interferometer prove to be precise in examine the light source obtain very accurate interferograms of each light source however there be significant limitation and source of error the main one be the inconsistent speed of the motor and the fft program which restrict a more thorough investigation of the light sources.despite these shortcoming we be still able to

2,2ndINT_BKZ271_Redacted,we analyse the spectrum of a tungsten-halogen lamp use a fourier-transform spectrometer the spectrometer record the intensity pattern from the interference of the radiation with itself it then performs a fourier transform on this pattern and reconstructs the radiation from the source we use this reconstruct spectrum to measure the peak emission wavelength for the lamp which we found be 825 ± 0.4nm the tungsten-halogen lamp can be treat a a black-body imply that the peak wavelength be related to the temperature of the body by wien 's displacement law the temperature of the body we calculate to be 3512 ± 2k a rtificial light through have year have undergone great change from candle oil lamp and coal fire in the 18th century to cfl bulb and lead lamp today however one thing that have remain constant be that any advancement in artificial light be a milestone in history the sudden popularisation of the electric bulb when thomas edison file his first patent in 1879 1 begin a great revolution in light incandescence be the phenomenon of an object emit light due to be heat to a high temperature this be first demonstrate by ebenezer kinnersley in 1763 with a wire 2 the first incandescent bulb be make use carbon filament held in evacuate case these lamp be not efficient a most of the energy be release a heat evacuate the inside also cause the formation of a black residue 3 on the inside of the bulb far reduce it efficiency this change with the advent of tungsten filament tungsten have the high melt and boil point amongst all metal make it the ideal candidate to use in an incandescent lamp michelson and morley first invent the interferometer in search of the `` ether `` 4 although the search be unsuccessful they have create an instrument that be use even today to make precise measurement e.g ligo detector the aim of this experiment be to investigate the spectrum of the tungsten lamp and to measure the operational temperature of the lamp a fourier-transform spectrometer ft be a michelson interferometer where one of the arm have variable length the advantage of use a ft instead of a regular spectrometer be that a the ft be align use a laser the measurement be more precise a second advantage could be that the measurement make by the ft use interference fringe whereas the regular spectrometer gather data on single frequency individually another advantage be that the intensity detect be much low in a regular spectrometer due to loss in reflection transmission and also the narrow slit use to let in light 5 the michelson interferometer invent by albert michelson be an instrument that u the phenomenon of interference of light wave to function in essence a a highly precise ruler fig1 be a representation of the setup use m 1 and m 2 be mirror that act a the end of the arm of the interferometer the beam splitter 7 be an instrument that split the incident light beam into two part it be make up of two prism join together by a dielectric coat on the hypotenuse of both prism this dielectric coat reflect 50 of the beam and transmits the other 50 a for it use in this experiment the beam be split and then recombine after each part be reflect from their respective mirror and interfere on recombination the interference be either constructive or destructive depend on the difference in the distance each beam travel the coat provide an additional phase difference π to the part reflect off it this cause dark fringe destructive interference to be see when there be zero path difference the interferometer cause two beam of light to interfere and produce fringe pattern that vary base on the phase difference between the two beam the manner of interference be determine by the difference in the length of the path the beam travel if this difference be an integer multiple of the wavelength nλ then the interference be constructive and a bright plane wave output be observe if the difference in path length be an integer multiple of half the wavelength n λ 2 no light be see at the output because of the way the mirror be set up there be two possible fringe pattern visible figure 2 and 3 show the two case the case in 2 have cylindrical symmetry both mirror be perpendicular to each other and so form circular fringe call haidinger fringe the case in 3 produce straight fringe know a fizeau fringe a the mirror be not align perpendicularly since these fringe would be form on the nanometre scale for a laser source lens be use in the setup refer to section on experimental method to enlarge the image lead and incandescent bulb be extend source and hence do n't require lens to achieve this consider the usage of a laser collimate beam source and move one of the mirror in order to scan the output this scan ought to show a certain spike in intensity at a particular point along the interferogram which be know a the 'null point it be the point the move mirror be at when the two arm of the interferometer be exactly equal in length the fourier transform be a mathematical tool that represent switch from position space to frequency space or viceversa when perform on a monochromatic single frequency wave it produce a single delta function in frequency space single delta function correspond to a series of bright and dark fringe however when a second frequency be add 2 delta function the intensity record be see to be modulate and beating be observe the interferometer can be use to scan the spectrum of a source and use a fourier transform to identify the different frequencies/wavelengths be use to produce the output hence a michelson interferometer with one move arm be know a a 'fourier transform spectrometer any body whose temperature great than absolute zero radiates energy in the form of thermal radiation the temperature of a body be related to the internal energy of that body i.e hotter body have high energy incandescent bulb be make use a thin metallic wire filament with a high electrical resistance this cause it to heat up like a resistor when current pas through the rise temperature cause an increase in the energy radiation but may also melt the filament tungsten have the high melt point 3695k among the metal and so be ideal for such usage the heating of the filament follow the joule heating effect 1 every light source have a characteristic emission spectrum base on it production and so a characteristic efficiency efficiency be thus the more efficient a source be the lesser it percentage emission of heat or infrared radiation incandescent source tend to emit large amount of heat and a a consequence reach very high temperature low efficiency incandescent bulb be fill with inert gas instead of a vacuum in order to lessen the heating of the case and the evaporation of the filament material every body with a temperature great than 0k emits radiation if this body be at thermal equilibrium 2 with it environment it be say to emit black-body radiation an incandescent light source when in thermal equilibrium be consider a black-body and it radiation have a characteristic spectrum and intensity accord to planck 's law black-body radiation follow a curve know a a planck distribution 9 this curve depends solely on the equilibrium temperature of the body and not on it shape size etc wien 's law defines the relationship between the peak wavelength the wavelength at which the lamp have the high intensity of emission and the temperature of the body 9 where t represent the temperature of the body and λ peak represent the peak wavelength of the black-body radiation spectrum the source use can be either a collimate light source or an extend source e.g lead but for the purpose of setup and alignment a laser collimate source be use in order to have the most accurate alignment possible accuracy be paramount in an interferometry setup a measurement be make on the scale of wavelength of light make them highly susceptible to error mirror m 1 be mount on a linear stage that be connect to a motor the motor move the stage back and forth across a 24mm range the detector record the intensity of the light a m 1 be move to vary the length of the arm the mirror use be small and although the lab be a `` dark lab `` a lens f 100mm be use at the source to focus the beam to a point this beam now split and a point image be see in m 1 this image be use to align the beam splitter perpendicular to m 1 such that the point be centre on m 1 an adjustable mirror m 2 be now introduce in the path of beam 2 and place perpendicular to the beam splitter align the point at the centre of m 2 ensures the overlap and hence interference of the beam on recombination a white card can be use a a screen to observe a clear image to fine-tune the alignment once align a second lens f 25.4mm be use to enlarge the image if both the mirror be set exactly perpendicular to each other the observe fringe will be haidinger fringe fig3 a the green laser be monochromatic the intensity profile would just be an infinite sine wave of a certain frequency this when put through a fourier-transform 10 produce a single narrow gaussian profile with the peak wavelength at approximately 523nm a the number of contribute wavelength get large the intensity variation begin to localise about the null point refer to appendix therefore to find the null point it be necessary to have interference from a white light source we use a white lead 11 for this and found the null point to be at x −7.01244mm on the coordinate system of the linear stage a the position of the null point only depends on the length of the arm of the interferometer it must have approximately the same position for any source of light that consists of multiple frequency the detector be connect to a computer that display the amplitude of the signal vary with the position of the linear stage m 1 a m 1 pas the null point a large spike in intensity be observe the amplitude exhibit a gaussian profile with the width dependent on the number of wavelength use to produce the incident spectrum fig4 show the position of the null point a observe use the tungsten lamp the lamp use be a thorlabs sls201l tungsten-halogen lamp that have a wavelength range 360nm − 2600nm a specify by the manufacturer the tungsten lamp without a filter act a a white light source meaning it be an extend light source compose of several frequency the lamp be connect to the setup via an optical fibre cable consider that the null point must be in the same position the intensity be record from −7.2mm to −6.8mm and a show in figure 4 the null point be found at x −7.01209mm assume there be no disturbance to the setup the change in it position result from non-uniform motion of the linear stage refer to error section of result once the null point be found the record data be put through a fast fourier transform fft in order to try and reconstruct the wavelength that the source be make up of fig5 show the plot of intensity against wavelength for the tungsten-halogen lamp a expect the spectrum be a continuous gaussian with the intensity peak at a certain wavelength black-body emission spectrum be characteristic of the temperature of the body and like the lamp star too can be described a black-bodies sunlight for example have the gaussian spectrum of a body with a peak wavelength approximately 540nm 3 in order to find the peak wavelength for the lamp we fit a gaussian function fig6 to fig5 where a be the amplitude x 0 the mean intensity σ the standard deviation and k an arbitrary offset constant we might expect a similar spectrum for tungsten due to it colour and it use a a lamp but in reality the tungsten lamp have a spectrum with a peak wavelength of approximately 825nm this mean it have a high contribution from infrared light and a low contribution of blue light a compare to sun and be what give an incandescent light source it characteristic yellow colour the error in the peak wavelength be calculate from the covariance of the fit parameter and be σ λ 0.4nm hence the peak wavelength be once we found the peak wavelength of the tungsten lamp we use wien 's law to calculate the temperature of the tungsten filament this come out to be the error in the temperature be calculate a follow iv result when take data number of sample to be record be one of the input a the detector sample at 50hz if the number input be not complete when the stage reach it destination it move a few nanometre back and forth and keep sample until either manually stop or the input condition be met another possibility be to set the number of sample base on the speed and scan range but the position of the null point still shift this could be due to the stage not cover a constant distance between two sample in principle the distance between consecutive sample be large or small than require so there be no constant value for the overshoot or undershoot of the stage the intensity of the tungsten lamp 's radiation must follow a planck disrtribution for a give wavelength but a observe in fig6 the intensity behaves approximately a a gaussian distribution this be cause by the detector have a fix range of sensitivity outside of which it do n't detect intensity this range be from 300nm to 1100nm with the peak sensitivity at 940nm a a result of this the wavelength from 1100nm to 2600nm be absent in the spectrum the operation temperature of the lamp a in the data sheet 12 be t rat 2796 k 7 fig7 show the true spectral power distribution of the lamp superimpose over that measure by the detector it be apparent from the fig7 that the true wavelength of maximum emission be outside the range of the detector thereby cause the difference ≈ 700k of the experimental result to the datasheet therefore the detector be a major source of systematic error in the experiment in conclusion we measure the temperature of the tungsten filament to be t f ilament 3512 ± 2k use the fouriertransform spectrometer the fourier transform itself be do use the scipy package on python a an incandescent lamp tungsten lamp be the most widely use a tungsten have the high melt point 3695k amongst all metal the measure temperature however be close to the melt point of tungsten meaning the filament must be evaporate rapidly even in the inert gas environment the result also translates to the filament be very fragile and near it break point however on accounting for the systematic error we observe that the lamp must be at a low

3,2ndINT_BMS328_Redacted,this investigation sought to observe some of the property of various light source with the use of a michelson interferometer this interferometer consist of a stepper motor which would change the type of haidinger fringe observe it be essential that the null point be found a this would be the point where reading would be measure from four different light source be use include a white lead a blue lead a tungsten halogen light source and a mercury discharge lamp the white lead produce two clear peak a expect with wavelength of 441nm ± 51.0nm and 563nm ± 123nm the former of these wavelength prove to match the calculate mean wavelength of the blue lead also analyse with a wavelength of 454nm ± 4.00 × 10 −8 m. the tungsten halogen light source be measure both with band pa filter and without the former of these provide lorentzian peak with the yellow filter lie within the range of the mean wavelength measure however the wavelength measure for the green filter do not lie within the bandwidth of the green filter use the measurement take without filter provide a curve that approximately follow that of a black body curve until the infared spectrum where these two line 'diverged due to the limitation of the detector the mercury fft provide two distinct peak with some splitting however the value obtain lay outside of the expect value for the green spectral line and yellow doublet t he first use of the michelson interferometer come in 1887 with the michelson-morley experiment which aim to detect the earth movement through the 'luminiferous ether 1 this configuration of interferometer have go on to be very useful in multiple area of study include the detection of ligo 's detection of gravitational wave in 2015 2 this investigation seek to investigate the composition and property of several light source which include white light from a tungsten and lead source a blue lead and a mercury discharge lamp this can be do by take interferograms of the various light source and use this to generate a fourier transform to determine property of the light source such a spectral width coherence length and peak wavelength this spectral analysis can be accomplish use the michelson interferometer which be another application of interferometry in it most fundamental form the michelson interferometer consists of two arm connect by a beam splitter which split and then recombine the light source which can be either monochromatic or chromatic from the two path to generate a superimpose signal compose of light and dark fringe which can be detect and analyse 3 there be two main type of interference pattern that be commonly produce by this kind of interferometer the first and most important for this investigation be the haidinger fringe which produce line of equal inclination and the frizeau fringe which generate line of equal separation haidinger fringe be more useful a in theory they should produce a more sinusoidal signal for intensity against distance move by one of the mirror on the interferometer in addition the haidinger fringe make it easy to find the null point of the interferometer which be where the path difference between the two path length t be zero there be two factor that affect the production of interference on a michelson interferometer with those be the linear distance between the mirror and the orientation of both mirror if this difference be simply linear and the mirror be perfectly align then haidinger fringe will be generate if however the respective mirror have differ orientation which would imply that the mirror be not perfectly align fizeau fringe be generate which can be see in fig 1. it can be thought of a a consequence of two virtual image interfere with one another separate by a particular distance 'white light be the mixture of all visible wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum at the null point the arm of the interferometer be equal in length and thus constructive interference occurs at all of the compose wavelength of 'white light source and white light will be visible at the detector a one move away from the null point there will be very specific constructive and destructive interference produce a colourful interference pattern a can see in fig 2. however a high order of interference be reach there will be common factor of the order of interference of the various wavelength compose white light which will lead to a match of interference which lead to a disappearance in the interference pattern a a result white light have a short coherence length of about 10µm the two 'white light source use have significant difference in their composition and construction white lead 's can be construct in several way with the most common type compose of a blue or uv lead with phosphor material help to create the white light spectrum on the other hand the stabilise tungsten halogen light source provide a constant black body radiation spectrum that range from 360 to 2600nm 5 this source therefore can be described by where b be the spectral radiance h be plank 's constant k b be the boltzmann constant c be the speed of light ν be the frequency of the em radiation and t be the temperature in kelvin when the interference pattern be detect by the photodiode an interferogram be produce this can take to determine the coherence length of the source which be simply the range over which the interferometer can scan before the resolution of the interferogram becomes too poor to measure and 'white noise be only detect an interferogram like any time dependent signal can be fourier transform to reveal information about the signal the fourier transform of a real time dependent function f t be where g ω be a function of angular frequency for a monochromatic source with infinitely thin spectral width a delta function δ ω will be produce the spectral line generate from a lamp should take the form of an approximate gaussian which can be express a with α be a constant 6 it can be see from fig 3 that the broader the spectral width of a source the thinner the interferogram and thus the shorter the coherence length the spectral width of a source can be calculate without the use of fourier analysis use the formula where ∆v be the spectral width measure in hz and l be the coherence length in meter the spectral width be related to σ for a gaussian for the coherence length this relationship can easily be obtain by measure the fwhm of the coherence length where the fwhm be the full width at half maximum for the interferogram and σ be the standard deviation of the same distribution which be equivalent to the spectral width of the source fig 3. illustration show a spectrum for a give source and their respective interferograms 7 from this the wavelength can be calculate without fourier analysis to be where c be the speed of light in a vacuum λ be the mean wavelength and ∆λ be the difference in wavelength across the spectrum fig 4 show a basic set up for the type of interferometer use in this investigation this type of interferometer consists of 5 main component the first of these be the source which can be mount inside a collimation package or can be place inside the v-block clamp this then lead to the cube beam splitter in which one of the side be coat in a reflective dielectric material which allows the light to be split and then recombine the two mirror have different system of movement which both have their u m 2 help with the alignment of the interferometer by provide two degree of freedom in order to generate the desire haidinger fringe mirror m 1 do not have this type of movement and so keep the fringe at a constant inclination the detector provide have an amplifier which be useful when certain light source have a low intensity than others the first procedure that have to be carry out be the alignment of the interferometer use a collimate green laser this involve align both of the laser spot so that they be directly over one another on the output arm this alignment can be make well by extend the distance of the output arm perfectly overlap the two light spot give a explain previously haidinger interference after the alignment process the null point have to be found this would be the point around which all interferograms would be take initially the difference in distance between the two orthogonal interferometer arm t be large the distance t be then reduce which cause the fringe pattern to move inwards towards the centre of the haidinger interference pattern a t → 0 the fringe become wider until only the central fringe be visible if t → −∞ the fringe move outwards until the central fringe becomes too small to measure 9 this provide a framework to find the null point due to the short coherence length of white light this be use to fine tune the location after the collimate laser have found it to the near 0.1mm after this the detector could be put in place and a series of measurement could take place it be important to scan over one coherence length to provide a complete spectral measurement whilst also scan with an appropriate resolution for the interferogram to be useful iv result and analysis fig 5 show an interferogram for a white lead scan across the entirety of the coherence length it be clear to see that this interferogram be not purely compose of a continuous distribution of wavelength due to some inflection in the interferogram like that see at -0.918. the approximate coherence length obtain from fig be 11µm ±1.84µm after the interferogram of the lead have be take a fourier transform could be perform a see if fig 6. two peak can clearly be see with these have peak wavelength of 441nm ± 51.0nm and 563nm ± 123nm for the first peak from the left and the peak furthest to the right respectively the significance of this result will be realise when the blue lead interferogram and fft be analyse the fft generate from this in fig 8 show a very well define peak with a spectral width of if 4 be use 5.97×10 12 hz±6.99×10 11 hz this lorenzian shape coheres to the concept of natural and doppler broadening 10 the peak wavelength obtain from this fft be 454nm ± 4.00 × 10 −8 m. the above result be significant due to the way in which the white lead 's be construct for this experiment the small of the two wavelength found in fig 6 have an associate error that lie within the range of the wavelength found from the fft of a blue lead a be expect 9 show two fft for a tungsten halogen light source with either a green or yellow filter affixed onto the light source once again similar to the blue lead the peak be lorentzian in character both peak be split in similar way at their top this make find λ peak especially challenge these two peak be found to be 530nm ± 3.00 × 10 −8 m for the green filter and 572nm ± 3.50 × 10 8 m for the yellow filter the filter use for this fft be band pa filter which would explain why there discontinuity either side of the peak these filter have central wavelength of 580nm±2nm for the yellow filter and 543.5nm ± 2nm for the green filter use 11 the range of the yellow filter measurement indeed lie within this range however the peak wavelength measure for the green filter do not lie within this range one explanation could be the fact that the green filter cause a large drop in intensity which would lead to a great uncertainty in the signal detect by the photodiode for the tungsten source without a filter a narrow interferogram be produce with a coherence length of 14µm ± 2.83. a this be a slightly large coherence length than for the white lead one would expect a very slightly narrower fft fig 11 show both the fft of the interferogram in fig 10 and the theoretical black body curve use both 1 and wein 's displacement law simply from observation the first portion of the black body curve in the ultraviolet spectrum move in some way like the signal they both peak a expect however when λ λ peak the two curve 'diverge and then recombine this be down to the range a the photodiode can not detect em in the infared the final light source analyse be a mercury discharge lamp the emission spectrum of a mercury lamp include a green line of wavelength 546.074nm and a yellow doublet of 576.959nm and 579.065nm 12 fig 12 show two distinct peak with well define splitting on both peak these peak however appear to be shorter wavelength than expect with the high two peak have wavelength of 540nm ± 50nm and 526nm ± 45nm with this large calculate error this indeed could be the yellow doublet however the small of the peak with a wavelength of 526nm ± 34nm this clearly be not the green line consider the success of the previous measurement some random error must have occur or the equipment be use in such a way to find a new fault there be a multitude of different explanation that could diagnose some of the problem face with this investigation and help to explain why some measurement like that of the tungsten with the green filter and the mercury discharge lamp be unsuccessfully take one possible explanation for any such problem be the concept of motor backlash backlash be when a motor loses motion which a a result lead to a discrepancy between the command position the position displayed on the computer and the actual position of the motor 13 other way of improve the result obtain would come from increase the sample size of some of our measurement a for some interferograms use like the one obtain for the green and yellow filter the interferogram be not smooth and sinusoidal like what be expect this may have produce smoother peak without asymmetry the information that be gain from the interferograms obtain through the use of a michelson interferometer prove for the most part to be very useful which render this experiment a success the interferograms for the lead 's measure prove to be successful and generate correct value tungsten prove to also be successful produce encourage fft 's the error encounter be most likely down to the mechanical shortcoming of the motor and it lack of consistency especially at the begin and end of the motor cycle,deep,exp,65,0.595206797,0.404793233,,,,,

68,2ndINT_XUQ367_Redacted,in this experiment we use a michelson interferometer to determine the spectrum of a white lead a blue lead tunsten light source with a green and yellow filter and a mercury discharge lamp the spectrum have gaussian fit to them to measure mean wavelength and the standard deviation be estimate to calculate coherence length the white lead have a mean wavelength of 506.8 ± 0.5nm with a coherence length of 2.48 ± 0.01μm and the blue lead have a mean wavelength of 470.1 ± 0.1nm with a coherence length of 5.36 ± 0.9μm the tungsten light source with a green and yellow filter have a mean wavelength of 542.5 ± 1nm and 577.4 ± 1nm respectively with coherence length of 5.36 ± 0.12μm and 4.58 ± 0.18μm respectively the mercury discharge lamp have a mean wavelength of 512.2 ± 0.8nm with a coherence length of 5.01 ± 0.5μm in this experiment we be investigate different light source by analyse their interferograms use a michelson interferometer interferometry be an important technique that have be use throughout science to prove fundamental theory in physic such a detect gravitation wave to disprove that light travel through an ether the interferometer work by partially splitting a beam of light and recombines them at the beam splitter the light will interfere at the beam splitter cause an interference pattern by investigate the interference pattern around the null point of the interferometer with a photometer a wave profile can be make for each of the light source by use fourier analysis the data obtain can be use to calculate spectral width of the source wavelength of the source and therefore coherence length to characterise the different light source the light source use be a white lead blue lead tungsten lamp with a yellow and a green filter and a mercury discharge lamp a diagram of the michelson interferometer be show below in figure 1. when the light beam split the reflect can travel in either two path path s1 or path s2 the beam splitter be make up of a partially silver surface and a dialectic plate that cause a phase change in the s2 beam if the path difference between s1 and s2 be an integer multiple of the wavelength of the light destructive interference would occur due to the dielectric plate cause a phase change when the wave recombine the amplitude of the recombine light can be give by equation 1. where e be the amplitude of light ωis the angular frequency of light t be time σis the wave number of the light wave i.e 1/wavelength and d be the path difference between the interfere light beam however the photometer do not measure amplitude directly but intensity instead intensity of any wave be give by the modulus square of the amplitude of the wave thus the intensity for a particular value of σis give by equation 2. it should be note that the amplitude e be a function of σ a the light source will have vary wavelength and hence vary the density of wave number σis related to the fourier transform of the interferogram record 2 where i d be intensity of light a a function of path difference between the interfere light source the full derivation of this be in appendix a. the intensity of light detect depends upon the interference pattern observe with the interferometer follow a gaussian distribution due to the fact that two interfere light source interfere a wave packet this mean that the fourier transform return another gaussian distribution and hence spectral width of the source can be calculate from equation 4 ∆ν c λ 2 ∆λ 4 where δλis the spectral width of the light source c be the speed of light λis the wavelength of the light source and δλis the wavelength width spectral width of a light source can be use to calculate coherence length coherence length be a measure of the distance over which one arm of a michelson interferometer can be scan before the interferogram visibility becomes poor citation the coherence length can be calculate from equation 5. where l be the coherence length in the case of interference pattern two type of fringe can occur if the mirror be align such that they be at exact right angle to each other and to the surface the interfere light source appear to come from an infinite distance away cause circular fringe if one mirror be at an angle in respect to the other mirror fizau fringe occur which appear more linear the equation govern the angle be give by equation 6. where t be the seperation of the mirror θis the respective angle m be the order of interference which be an integer and be the wavelength of light the null point be when t=0 a more define interferogram can be take by scan over the null point and be therefore important to the experiment the interferometer be set up on a stable stage so that the optical element could be fix we make sure that the mirror be at approximately equal length it do not need to be precise a mirror 2 move on a translational stage to find the null point a laser be use a the light source in the interferometer a convex lens be attach at the recombination point at the beam splitter which have a focal length of 24.5mm the photometer be move out of the way of the beam and a screen be place at a distance away from the beam splitter mirror 1 be adjust until haidinger fringe appear by move mirror 2 slowly the circular fringe will either appear to be move inwards or outwards depend on the direction of movement of mirror 2. the null point be the point at which the ring change direction from move inwards to outwards or vice-versa the haidinger fringe be difficult to notice with the light source use in the investigation unless close to the null point therefore the green laser be use a the fringe pattern be much more noticeable at distance just over 10mm away from the null point a precise figure for our null point can not be give a it change depend on each laboratory session due to external influence move the optical element once the null point be found the green laser be carefully remove so that the beam splitter do not move and the light source be put in place anomalous result can be cause by stray ray interfere with the ray that go through the beam splitter this be reduce by place the light source in a matte black tube that collimate the light source and matte black card place towards the end of this tube to far reduce stray ray the interferogram be measure by vary the distance move by mirror 2 over small distance of roughly 0.25mm the interferogram be measure by the photometer and the data be record directly to a computer that can process the data to a fourier transform safety precaution have to be make when use the different light source when handle the green laser it be important not to shine any light directly into someone 's eye include the interference pattern light furthermore the mercury discharge lamp also emits uv light which be ionise and can cause blindness to avoid the danger of uv safety goggles be worn when the lamp be turn on to avoid effect of uv exposure to our eye a white lead be make from a blue lead with a yellow phosphor therefore 2 gaussian distribution should be observe from the fourier transform the interferogram of the white lead be asymmetrical due to misalignment of the interferometer this can affect the result but not to a substantial degree of accuracy the spectrum show two spectral line that be in a gaussian distribution the peak wavelength of the blue spectral line be 445.3 ± 0.2nm with a standard deviation of 10.4 ± 0.2nm and the peak wavelength of the yellow phosphor spectral line be 562.8 ± 0.2nm with a standard deviation of 55.5 ± 1nm the latter spectral line be just above the boundary of the yellow-green spectrum so can therefore be except a a non anomalous result the value be obtain by use computer optimisation that also return value for the uncertainty in peak wavelength the mean wavelength of the whole lead be calculate by use amplitude a a weight factor in the mean which be calculate to be 506.8±0.5nm the standard deviation be use to calculate the spectral width meaning that δλ= 24.5 ± 0.9 for the blue part of the spectrum and δλ= 103.7 ± 1nm for the yellow part of the spectrum this give a combine δλof 128.2±2nm from 4 we calculate δνto be 121.0±1thz then use 3 the coherence length be calculate to be 2.48 ± 0.01 μm next we analyse the blue lead the interferogram and fourier transform be show in figure 4 and 5 respectively the blue lead have a gaussian peak at 470.1±0.1nm with a standard deviation of 20.3 ± 0.1nm this meant that the δλfor the blue lead be 20.3 ± 0.1 result in a value for δνto be calculate at 27.5 ± 0.3thz therefore the coherence length be 5.36 ± 0.9μm we analyse the tungsten light source with a green filter and a yellow filter the interferogram for the green filter tungsten light be show below the interferogram pattern show in figure 6 be due to the nature of the filter the green filter transmits light in gaussian form with a peak wavelength of 543.5 ± 2nm with a standard deviation of 4.2 ± 0.8nm 4 this mean that the result interferogram be a resultant of a convolution with the filter and the tungsten light source from figure 7 we fit a single gaussian curve and two separate gaussian curve the peak wavelength of the single gaussian curve be found to be 539.9 ± 1.2nm and the mean wavelength of the two gaussian curve be found to be 542.5 ± 1.1nm the two mean wavelength be similar so it be possible that these two peak be due to a small misalignment that cause the interferogram of the white light it could also be cause by distance between sample take be too large this be also cause the single gaussian peak to have a small amplitude a all the point be use in the optimisation however the amplitude do not affect the mean wavelength for the single peak the mean wavelength from the two gaussian peak would leave out the dip in the fourier transform therefore if we assume that the dip be an anomalous result the mean wavelength of 542.5 ± 1nm would be more accurate from use the two gaussian peak a our accepted result the spectral width be found to be 55.9 ± 0.2thz use 5 we obtain a value of 5.36 ± 0.12μm the result for the tungsten light with the yellow filter be show below the interferogram for the tungsten light source with the yellow filter have a similar shape to the tungsten light source with the green filter for the same reason again a single gaussian fit do not seem appropriate but from analysis of the other two curve the mean wavelength be calculate to be 577.4 ± 1nm the spectral width be calculate to be 65.5 ± 0.2thz which obtains a coherence length of 4.58 ± 0.18μm the error give for the tungsten light source for the wavelength be give by the fit for the curve however these error may not be the true value of the error a the two peak fit for the tungsten light source be not a accurate a the other fit for the white lead and blue lead the final light source that be observe and scan around the null point be the mercury discharge lamp the interferogram do not have a distinct gaussian peak this be due to the fact that mercury lamp have many spectral line two different curve be fit to the spectrum of the mercury lamp to investigate the appearance of a doublet in 500-600nm part of the mercury lamp spectrum the initial parameter of the optimisation be change in order to identify any doublet however the mercury spectral line be not distinct which make it difficult to identify the doublet from the curve fit with two peak the mean wavelength be calculate to be 512.2 ± 0.8nm with a δλof 54.4 ± 0.7nm therefore the spectral width be calculate to be 5.99 ± 0.7thz with a coherence length of 5.01 ± 0.5μm.it be know that mercury emits light in the uv spectrum despite this no light be detect in the uv range this be because the photometer detects light within a certain range of wavelength this be discus far in the appendix concern the derivation of the fourier transform v. conclusion in this experiment we be use a michelson interferometer to determine the spectrum and coherence length of different light source this be do by measure the signal of the interfere beam and obtain an interferogram for the light source a fourier transform of the interferogram make a spectrum for the light source so that coherence length can be calculate the white lead and blue lead have spectrum 's that have gaussian curve which be a expect however the tungsten lamp with the filter do not have a strong gaussian fit this could be due to misalignment but be be more likely that the sample rate be not high enough affect the fourier transform obtain if the tungsten experiment be to be repeat again a high sample rate would obtain a well spectrum for tungsten light with the filter the mercury lamp interferogram be not distinctive due to the fact that mercury have many more spectral line than lead however the fourier transform return a two peak that be relatively gaussian which meant that calculation could be perform if the whole experiment be to be repeat each interferogram should be measure more than once to obtain an average in order to reduce random error word count:2290

69,2ndINT_YMJ516_Redacted,he application of device which emit radiation be almost a numerous a the device themselves while light-emitting diode which saw their first practical production in 1962 1 be originally only able to produce emission in the infra-red region they have since be design to emit light across the visible spectrum for use in aviation light automotive headlamp and digital display in fact in 2014 a nobel prize be award to nakamura et al for their work in the 1990 's on the production of the first blue lead 2 lamp contain tungsten or mercury have be use for domestic light but many have be discontinue after the discovery of their high uv emission in order to reliably design and manufacture these device it be important to be able to characterize them in term of the spectrum they emit the intensity of their emission and their operating temperature one technique for characterize these source be interferometry by observe the behaviour of interfere electromagnetic wave it be possible to learn about the source itself the medium that the wave be travel through and also the equipment use to detect it the result of interferometry be call an interferogram and from the fourier analysis of these we can find the emission spectrum of source an example of an interferometer be use in modern physic be the ligo experiment in america where use an interferometer with 4 km long arm the first detection of gravitational wave be make by observe the slight fluctuation of the interference pattern cause by a change in the length of the interferometer arm ten time small than the size of the proton 3 evidence by this example interferometry be a staple in experimental physic and it be by this method that this experiment analyse the property of a range of optical source the lead 's study in this experiment be base on semiconductor diode these emit light by provide enough energy for electron to cross the gap between the valence and conduction band and recombine with hole result in photoemission the reason that lead 's have a finite bandwidth be that the band gap be not the same distance everywhere produce a spectrum of possible energy for emit photon the impurity in the semiconductor material be such that the spectrum of lead 's can be approximate by a gaussian distribution an incandescent tungsten filament lamp produce white light from a thin wire carry a high current the filament becomes hot with many device have operating temperature of around 3000 k 4 tungsten filament lamp can be approximate to blackbody and so their spectrum can be expect to follow planck 's law where 𝐸 𝜆 be the energy emit per unit volume of a cavity in the blackbody λ be the wavelength emit and t be the temperature of the source 5 for a blackbody of temperature t the peak wavelength λmax can be found use wien 's displacement law 2 where b be the `` wien 's displacement constant `` 6 this can be derive from planck 's law 1 numerically use newton 's method while a range of `` monochrome `` lead 's can be produce by vary the semiconducting material use to produce a white lead a common method involves coat a blue lead in a phosphor a popular choice for this be ce 3+ yag which emits a broad bandwidth of yellow light 7 the combination of the narrower blue band and the wider yellow band produce an overall white light by have those photon emit by the characterisation of optical source by method of interferometry and fourier analysis t lead which do n't pa through the coat excite the phosphor electron result in yellow emission this phosphor band can also be approximate to a gaussian two source of the same wavelength will interfere when superpose on the same position with bright concentric circular fringe form at the point where the path difference between the two source be an integer number of wavelength for two source of different wavelength fringe can still form but the point at which they do be dependent on the difference between the two wavelength for example the separation t where the first maximum be found for source of wavelength λ1 and λ2 must satisfy the follow condition a more source be add the point where constructive interference form ring become more complicate to calculate however the one point where fringe can always be found be the point where the separation be zero this be know a the null point and be where due to the change in the degree of interference the amplitude of the resultant waveform be most sensitive change in separation this be a sensible place to scan to form an interferogram of a source contain multiple wavelength such a a blackbody the process of the experiment involve analyse the source through spectroscopy by first record the signal produce by the source a they interfere at the null point and then use fourier analysis to characterise the source in term of their emission spectrum the michelson interferometer use be assemble a described by figure 1. from there the difference in the path of the beam d1 -d2 determines the type of interference observe at the detector the interferometer be assemble such that d1 ≈ d2 so that the detector be near the null point then by scan short distance between every millimetre the rough position of the null point be found to find the null point a green laser of wavelength 532 nm be use a it form bright fringe which could be use to as whether the mobile mirror be move towards or away from the null point if the mirror be approach the null point the concentric fringe would appear to collapse inwards if the mirror be recede from the null point the fringe would appear to expand outwards with the null point locate the green laser be replace with a blue lead a white lead and then a collimate tungsten lamp for each of the source the mobile mirror be programmed to scan across the null point and the signal detect be record on a computer the data record by the detector be unpacked in a python module and a 2d plot library be use to produce interferograms of each of the source use a fast fourier transform package the data be employ to produce the wavelength domain representation of the signal it be expect that the step size between data point should be 1 -2 nm to verify this we form a histogram of the distance between adjacent data point the result of this be described by figure 2. we found that there be distribution of step size centre about -1 nm this value be non-zero because the mobile mirror have a speed and be negative because the mirror be move from right to left in this scan we take the mean of step size in the second and third quartile to omit those near the begin and end because at these point we found the motion of the mobile mirror be stutter this mean be use to plot the theoretical fit for the source spectrum since the blue lead be effectively monochromatic we would expect the interferogram of it signal to display a singlet wave packet this be what be found and the fourier transform of the data be displayed in figure 3. use the gaussian the lead be estimate to have a peak wavelength of 473.84 ± 0.48 nm with the error arise from the covariance matrix of the gaussian fit this place the blue lead in the blue region of the visible spectrum 9 a expect the fwhm of the gaussian be calculate to estimate the bandwidth of the blue lead to be 30.48 ± 1.11 𝑛𝑚 the white lead be expect to have two peak in it wavelength space representation one peak in the blue region of the visible spectrum and a second peak in the yellow region figure 4 show the wavelength spectrum of the white lead the profile of the fit in figure 4 be that of the sum of two gaussians indicate two main emission band the first band be found to have a peak wavelength of 460.83 ± 1.92 𝑛𝑚 and a bandwidth of 34.86 ± 4.18 𝑛𝑚 these value be like those of the blue lead which be encourage a we know the white lead contains one of these the second band be found to have a peak wavelength of 585.78 ± 2.39 𝑛𝑚 which be in the yellow region of the visible spectrum and a bandwidth of 151.88 ± 6.06 𝑛𝑚 this be much wider than the blue peak which indicates that there be a wide range of allow transition in the yellow region of the visible spectrum possibly due to there be multiple layer of slightly different phosphor coat the similarity in the amplitude of these two peak be what give the lead it clean white colour have one of the peak be significantly great than the other the lead would have appear to be a cooler or warmer white figure 5 show the simulation of a white light source the profile of the interferogram in figure 6 closely follow the prediction make by the simulation in figure 5. here the tungsten lamp appear to behave a expect the tungsten lamp be found to operate at a temperature of 2796 k 10 and be expect to behave a a blackbody of this characteristic temperature for the tungsten lamp a model utilise planck 's law 1 be use to attempt a fit curve to the profile of the data the result of this be found in figure 7. here the tungsten lamp be discover to not behave a expect base on the know operating temperature of the tungsten we would expect a wavelength space representation which peak later and with a longer tail than that we see in figure 7. if we omit the tail of the profile of the experimental data and assume the lamp be act a a blackbody we find use wien 's displacement law 2 that the lamp have an operating temperature of 3625 k. this be far above the know operating temperature it be possible that a tungsten lamp be in fact much different than a blackbody however there be much evidence external to this experiment that suggests this be n't the case with this rule out the practical conclusion be that the detector have a finite range of wavelength over which it can reliably detect a signal this detection drop of rapidly for wavelength great than 800 nm for this reason it be not sensible to characterise the tungsten source use this apparatus this experiment use a michelson interferometer and fourier analysis technique to characterise a blue lead and a white lead an attempt be make to characterise a tungsten lamp but it be conclude that a reliable estimate of it property could not be make with our experimental apparatus the property of the characterise source be described in table 1,superficial,the,70,0.103372492,0.896627545,,,,,
70,2ndINT_YZI659_Redacted,this report be an investigation into categorise different light source use interferometry and fourier transforms a a spectrometer five different light source be test a blue lead which yield a wavelength of 470.1 ± 8.6 nm a white lead comprise of two wavelength of 445.3 ± 10.4 nm and 562.8 ± 55.5 nm respectively these be in the red and blue part of the visible spectrum and combine to give white light a tungsten source be also test with a green and a yellow filter to give 539.9 ± 23.1 nm and 572.4 ± 30.6 nm the final source that be test be a mercury discharge lamp which have peak of 433.8 ± 20.6 nm and 547.9 ± 31.8 nm with a doublet value of 568.5 ± 1.1 nm these wavelength be that of the emission spectrum of mercury and all lie within 1.5 of the accepted value t his experiment aim to categorise light source and their spectrum by use an interferometer a a spectrometer use the technique of fourier transforms this be a very powerful technique in many different aspect of physic so it be important to ensure that knowledge of how it work be know the instrument be also very sensitive so it be easy to misalign the apparatus and get false data so great care have to be take to align it properly once this be do any source can be test and it spectrum extract ii theory this project u the technique of interferometry and fourier transforms to investigate different light source interferometry be a technique in which wave in this case the wave be electromagnetic be superimpose to cause interference information about the wave can then be extract from this pattern of interference the interferometer use in this experiment be know a a michelson interferometer it consists of a light-source that be pas into a beam-splitter which cause part of the light to pa out at a right angle form the incident ray both of these beam be then reflect off mirror before be recombine in the beam-splitter and be measure at a detector what be measure be the interference of the recombine beam at the detector these interfere due to a path difference on the two arm of the interferometer if monochromatic plane wave of wavelength λ be pas through the interferometer they will interfere constructively to cause a bright fringe when the path difference be an integer multiple of λ and destructivly to cause a dark patch when it be λ 2 this interference cause a pattern of fringe there be two type of fringe that can be see in this experiment haidinger and fizeau these occur from different orientation of the mirror a convenient way to picture this be with two mirror separate by a distance t which represent the path difference of the arm in the interferometer this be show in figure 2. since this be an extend source the angle θ will vary for all the incoming ray there will only be constructive interference to cause bright fringe when the path difference of the two ray be equal to an an integer number of wavelength so since θ varies between the ray there will only be constructive interference at specific value of θ. this cylindrical symmetry of this set up cause the haidinger fringe which be circular in shape by tilt one of the mirror this cylindrical symmetry be broken thus cause straight line fizaeu fringe this be demonstrate in the figure 3 it be the haidinger fringe that be use in this experiment a this be when the set up be correctly align the equation that governs these fringe be give by in this investigation the interferometer be be use a a spectrometer to determine wavelength of different light source this can be do by use the mathematical method of fourier transforms a fourier transform be a method that take a signal that be a function of time and decomposes it into the frequency that make it up in this way a signal can be measure on an interferogram and when a fourier transform be act on it a function of wavelength or frequency can be extract this be do by scan a sample around where t=0 which be know a the null point a corollary of fourier transforms be that a gaussian will give rise to another gaussian under a fourier transform since the light source use approximate gaussians then the transform in frequency space will also be a gaussian with an associate spread this spread in frequency space be inversely proportional to the spread in the measure signal a narrow gaussian spectral line be cause by a wide interferogram and the oposite be true for a wide spectral line this be demonstrate in the figure below it be this technique that be use to extract the information about wavelength and frequency that make up the light source this investigation look to characterise five different source of light a blue and white lead a tungsten light with green and yellow filter and a mercury discharge lamp first before any of these source be test it be require that the interferometer be set up and align correctly so that the position of the null point could be locate correctly to do this the set up show in figure 1 be construct on an optical bench care have to be take to ensure that the two mirror be equidistant from the beam-splitter so the path length would not exceed that of the coherence length this would cause no interference to occur next the set up be align use a green laser the laser be pas through the beamsplitter with a convex lens place between the two this cause the beam to spread out and aid in get the alignment correct the detector be remove and the pattern create by the two beam be observe the fix mirror have knob on it that allow for an adjustment of it tilt and these be adjust until the two beam from both mirror overlap and interference fringe could be see it be possible to see both haidinger circular and fizeau flat fringe the haidinger fringe expect can be see below once this be see the set up be align the next step be to locate the null point and this be most easily do with the same green laser one of the mirror be move via a computer at a control speed to create in interferogram this be do over a large range so that the high peak could be see and this be the null point to find this quickly though it be see that a the mirror approach the null point the circular fringe get large and also move concentrically towards the center and the opposite be true for move away this be use to gain a rough estimate of the range of value that contain the null point by observe the movement of the fringe at different value this range be then scan at a slow speed to find the exact value of the null point once the null point be locate data be able to be collect each light source be in turn place in front of the beam-splitter and a slow scan over the null point be conduct this data be then use to create an interferogram which could then be fourier transform to give graph of the intensity of light that be emit at different wavelength in this section the graph and fit of each different light source will be show displayed first be be the graph for the blue lead figure 7 show that a white lead be comprise of two distinct wavelength of λ 1 445.3nm and λ 2 562.8nm with spread of 10.4nm and 55.5nm respectively the graph see at the end of the next page be those of the tungsten lamp first with a yellow filter and second with a green filter the different peak wavelength highlight in the mercury plot can be see displayed in the table below v. discussion the first source that be test be the blue lead a can be see in the section before it have a peak wavelength of 470.1±8.6 nm a true blue phosphor lead have a wavelength of 470nm so the measure value be accurate with the expect value and also precise with an error of 1.8 it can be see in figure 6 that there be only one sharp spike in the wavelength spectrum indicate that this be the only wavelength present in the source this be what would be expect from a blue lead the next source test be the white lead in figure 7. it can be see here that there be two gaussian peak of 445.3 ± 10.4 nm and 562.8 ± 55.5 nm these peak correspond to a peak in the blue and a peak in the red part of the visible spectrum this be due to the white lead be form by a blue short wavelength lead that cause the first spike with a yellow phosphor coat this coat release red light when it interacts with the photon be release from the lead and this be what cause the second peak the combination of these two source of light be what cause the lead to be white adjust the amount of coat can adjust how red the lead be cause white lead to be either cool more blue light or warm more red light these value have a percentage error of 2.3 and 9.8 respectively but this be due to the spread of the gaussian of the wavelength a discus before a sharp spike in an interferogram cause a large spread in the wavelength so this show that the region of interference for the red light be very small when compare to white lead spectrum the measure data match the next source use be a tungsten source that have a yellow and a green filter place in front of it the spectrum for these can be see in figure 8 and 9 respectively the first be the yellow filter and this have a peak wavelength of 572.4±30.6 nm which have a percentage spread of 5.4 this wavelength be what would be expect from a yellow filter source figure 9 show the spectrum for the green filter tungsten source this have a peak wavelength of 539.9 ± 23.1 nm which have a percentage spread of 4.3 this be consistent with the expect wavelength of green light it also have a small spread than the yellow filter show that the interference range be great it can be see in both figure that there be a dip in the middle of the spectrum which look like an apparent doublet this be an anomaly that arises from misalignment of the interferometer a it pas over the null point this could be fix by more accurately align the set up and make sure that it do n't move when a new source be connect the final source test be a mercury discharge lamp see in figure 10 and 11. these two plot contain the same data but with different gaussian curve plot over them to signify two possible position of the mercury doublet the two main peak of both figure be locate at 433.8 ± 20.6 nm and 547.9 ± 31.8 nm give percentage spread of 4.7 and 5.8 these value correspond to the atomic emission spectrum of mercury which have emission line at 435.8nm and 546.1nm for violet and green spectral line these lie close to the measure value show that these value be accurate be only 0.5 and 0.3 off the accepted value it can be see also that the second peak contains two peak indicate that there be a doublet present here where the accepted value of this be 577.0nm this indicates that it be the fit show in figure 10 that be the correct fit with wavelength of 568.5 ± 1.1 nm which have percentage spread of 0.2 and lie 1.5 off the accepted value this show that this be accurate with accepted data and be also a precise measurement the aim of this report be to use the technique of interferometry and fourier transforms to measure and categorise light source use the interferometer a a spectrometer the light source that be test be a blue and a white lead a tungsten source with green and yellow filter and a mercury discharge lamp it be measure that the blue light have a wavelength of 470.1 ± 8.6 nm which be accurate with the value of the wavelength of a blue lead which be 470nm the next source test be white lead which have two peak of 445.3 ± 10.4 nm and 562.8 ± 55.5 nm respectively this translates to a peak in the blue and red part of the visible spectrum which be consistent with how white lead be form the tungsten source have peak wavelength of 572.4 ± 30.6 nm for the yellow filter and 539.9 ± 23.1 nm for the green filter light these peak be less define a the set up be not properly align which lead to there be a dip in the middle of the spectrum cause it to look like two separate peak the final source test be a mercury discharge lamp this have peak at 433.8 ± 20.6 nm and 547.9 ± 31.8 nm with a doublet value of 568.5 ± 1.1 nm these correspond to the atomic emission specrum of mercury and be 0.5 0.3 and 1.2 off the accepted value for this emission
