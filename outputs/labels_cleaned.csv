0,GS_VJL711_Redacted,where z be the atom 's atomic number 𝜀 0 be the vacuum permittivity me be the electron 's mass and e be the charge of the electron if we divide eq 2.2 by eq 2 2.6 where v and t be potential the kinetic energy of electron respectively 5 since the energy of a photon emit by a hydrogen atom be give by the difference of two hydrogen energy level where n and m be positive integer and n be great than m. from the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a photon 𝜈 𝑐 𝜆 2.9 where c be the speed of light eq 6 can be rewrite a for hydrogen atom the atomic number z be 1. therefore the rydberg constant be define a in this experiment we experimentally measure the rydberg constant if hydrogen gas be heat or electrically charge the electron in the atom be excite and the add energy push the electron to high energy orbitals when the electron fall back to their original position the add energy be re-emitted in the form of photon and the wavelength of the photon be determine by the differnece in energy between the orbitals a show in where m can be call the order number we set up the spectrometer a show in fig 3.1 use a collimator a grate and a camera with a crosshair and ensure that they be in parallel the beam of photon from the light source be diffract by the grate so we set the angular position of the camera when they be parallel a an origin and rotate it until a light fringe be observe then we measure the angle of diffraction by measure the change in angle from the origin use a vernier we repeat this with a many other fringe a possible and statisticised the result to find the rydberg constant although the rydberg constant obtain from the experiment be reasonably close to the theoretical value the uncertainty of the constant be unacceptably huge and we found that there be various reason that affected our value since the room be dark and it be hard to read the cramped number on the veriner the angle of diffraction could be measure imprecisely we conclude that this be the major factor that affected the inaccurate rydberg constant we found that the major uncertainty emerge in consequence of the wide slit size since this cause the thicker width of the light fringe this could be improve by use a narrow slit there could be various systematic error that affected the result we try to perfectly align the spectrometer but this could be unsuccessful also the position of the lamp should have be a close to the slit a possible since it be directly related to the intensity of the light this could make u see the cyan colour light the air pressure and humidity be also other source but we decide that they be negligible there be background light which be inevitably require to measure the angle of diffraction we thought this could be the reason why the cyan colour of light and the 3 rd order light fringe of red and violet light be not detect and test without any light but we still could not see the line in the experiment we try to measure the rydberg constant use a hydrogen gas tube and a spectrometer and we get 𝑅 ∞ 10.5 × 10 6 ± 4.4 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 which be only 0.4 unit less than the theoretical value however we fail to obtain the precise value a our uncertainty be over 40 percent of our value and we conclude that the width of the slit be not narrow enough to produce the precise result this could be improve by repeat the experiment in a darker room with a narrower slit width and a clearer vernier a for reference this be the code that have be use for data analysis,extended,bal
1,GS_GXI055_Redacted,he aim of this experiment be to determine a value for the wavelength of the emission spectrum of several different compound this be do by burning the compound use initially a candle but later on a butane blowtorch to excite the electron to a high energy shell which lead to them lose their energy in the form of a photon a they transition back down to a low energy state the wavelength of this light be measure use a grate spectrometer the two compound that we will be use be licl and cuso 4 these compound be not the only one that we attempt to determine the wavelength of however we could not excite the electron with either the blowtorch or the candle so we do not find a value for the wavelength of these compound the grate will measure the angle between the different slit of light from the emission spectrum the experiment rest upon the idea that a diffraction grate will turn a beam of light of the same wavelength into several maximum and minimum due to interference of the light wave from this and the knowledge of distance between the grate we can calculate the wavelength of the slit from which we can calculate which transition between orbitals the light represent when a compound be heat the electron within the atom of that compound be excite meaning they now have more energy consequently they will transition from a low energy orbital to one of high energy 3 the energy that the electron have absorbed be exactly equal to the energy of the high orbital minus the energy of the low orbital eventually the electron de-excite meaning that they transition back to a low energy orbital they then release the excess energy a a photon of light with a wavelength 𝜆 correspond to that energy this be express in equation 2.1 a well a be show in figure 1. where h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light in m/s the energy of the high energy orbital and the low energy orbital be specific to the compound meaning that specific wavelength will be observe from the emission spectrum of different compound the diffraction grate be make up of a large number of narrow slit that be equally space it have n slit with a slit separation d 5 a maximum will occur when the phase difference between two adjacent ray be 2𝜋𝑚 with m be determine wavelength of emission spectrum use a grate spectrometer t an integer represent the order of the slit consequently we have equation 2.2. a path difference be equal to 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 where 𝜃 be the angle between the central maximum and the maximum we be measure we arrive at equation 2.3. 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 𝑚𝜆 2.3 this equation allows u to relate the angle of the maximum to the wavelength of the emission spectrum the maximum and minimum be show in figure 2 6 the maximum number of order produce be found when we take 𝜃 𝜋 2 this be because the large diffraction angle that we can have from a grate that be perpendicular to the light ray be use si for all unit we set up the equipment a show in figure 3. we have a choice of several diffraction grate with different quantity of line per mm we decide to use the low line per mm diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm this be because this grate will produce the slit a close a we can get them this be because for this grate d be the high value if we look at equation 2.3 we can see that this will give u a small value of 𝜃 for a give value of m. equation 2.4 show u that for this big value of d we will have a large number of order m that will be visible the light come from the burning compound it then pas through the narrow slit after which it be make parallel by the collimate lens the parallel light then hit the grate at normal incidence where it be diffract this light be then focus by the camera lens onto the crosshair at the point x. the eyepiece can be use to view the magnify image we make sure to adjust the slit and the end of the collimator to ensure that all of the diffraction slit be thin meaning that it be easy to determine their angle from the central fringe this also help ensure that the excess light not from the compound be more easily distinguishable from the fringe we decide not to take too much time make sure the central fringe be at 0 degree instead we take the value that the central fringe be at and then subtract this from all of the measurement to essentially make this the zero point this method be just a precise a calibrate the spectrometer to 0 degree this be do in order to save time so that we could take more measurement this process be show in appendix a and b. measurement be take by look through the eyepiece and line up the lens to align with one of the slit we then use the protractor attach to the side of the spectrometer to measure the angle that the lens be at this be then repeat for all of the slit that be visible to u in order for the slit to be easily distinguish we do the experiment in almost complete darkness in order to produce the emission spectrum that we need to carry out the experiment we have to burn the compound we be initially instruct to use a candle to burn the compound and produce the light when this method be try however we encounter a few problem the first be that the candle flame do n't appear to be hot enough 8 to produce the number of photon need to make the measurement the second problem be if any photon be be produce they be not noticeable due to the large amount of light produce from the candle itself to alleviate this issue we decide to use a butane blowtorch a it be much hotter than a candle flame 9 a well a the flame be less bright in order to use the blowtorch we place the compound into a metal bowl with some candle wax inside the wax be there a we found that the compound burn much brighter when they be mixed with the wax make it easy to carry out our experiment we then aim the torch downwards towards the compound a it be turn on this produce lot of colour light which we be able to analyse through the eyepiece these measurement have to be take relatively quickly a we found that if the compound burn for too long the candle wax would start to boil spit at u therefore make it unsafe to work the data that we gather from the method be summarise in table 1 and table 2. we observe the light from the licl to be red and the light from the cuso 4 to be green this be all do in python for this reason we take the sine of all the value we have record then plot this data against m on a graph a be show in figure 4 and 5. the error bar be a combination of the error due to the equipment add to the error due to the width of the slit meaning the angle measurement have a range these error be add in quadrature for fig 4 we have a gradient of 0.05637. this be calculate in python by use the polyfit function that be part of the scipy package use the covariance matrix in python we calculate that the uncertainty in the graph be ±0.0005044 this uncertainty be very small in relation to the value for the gradient this be because the point on the graph all give a very similar value for wavelength so they all line up on the graph use equation 4.1 we can see that in order to find the wavelength we multiply the value for the gradient by the distance in between each line on the grate a the grate have 78.8 line per mm we calculate that the distance between each slit be 0.0000127m we can multiply this by the gradient to find that the wavelength for photon emit from licl to be 6.82 × 10 −7 ± 8 × 10 −9 m. it be obvious that the error in cuso 4 be big than the error in licl this be partially due to have less data point for the cuso 4 than the licl this be because the after the 1 st order maximum the 2 nd order maximum be too faint to be distinguish from the background light which be mainly be produce by the blowtorch from do this experiment we notice several area for improvement both the candle and the blowtorch both give wide spectrum from their own light consequently the slit of light be much less well define meaning that it be much more difficult to measure the angle another issue be that due to have to use a small aluminium container with wax in it meant we could only burn the compound for a short amount of time after a short duration of the blow torch be on the container would start to melt this be due to the melt point of aluminium be low than the temperature of the torch 10 the setup we use also meant that the light tend to flicker a we be heating the compound this also make it far more difficult to take precise measurement in order to solve all of these problem if we be to repeat the experiment we would use the follow setup to heat the compound a bunsen burner would be setup and set to a blue flame a metal scalpel would be use to scoop up the compound and place it into the flame release photon this mean we would only have to stop each measurement when all of the compound be burn this be a definite improvement a we would have a consistent way to burn the compound get rid of some of the flicker that we previously experienced it will also mean that we would have longer to take our measurement for the angle meaning that our value will likely be more accurate a we will not have to rush in conclusion the value of the wavelength for photon emit from licl be 𝜆 682 × 10 −7 ± 800 × 10 −7 m the value for the wavelength of the photon emit from cuso 4 be 𝜆 5.43 × 10 −7 ± 4.5 × 10 −8 m neither of the value for the wavelength that we have determine through our experiment agree with the accepted value for wavelength of the photon emit from the compound there be a percentage difference of 3 for licl and 11 for cuso 4 from the accepted value in order to gain more accurate value for the wavelength we would repeat the experiment again make the change that i suggest in part v of this report,extended,the
2,GS_NGT657_Redacted,the rydberg constant be one of the most important constant in atomic physic due to it relation to other fundamental constant and because of the high level of accuracy to which it be possible to determine it value this experiment aim to use a grate spectrometer to accurately measure this constant by observe the emission spectrum produce by a hydrogen discharge lamp and measure the diffraction angle of the different spectral line use these to calculate their wavelength and then rydberg 's constant use the rydberg formula the value achieve by this method be 11030000 m -1 with an uncertainty of ± 4000 m -1 this place the result 14 σ away from the accepted value of 10973731 m -1 hen excite to high energy state all atom produce emission spectrum due to the transition of the atom 's electron from high to low energy level emit energetic photon a they do so these spectrum be unique to every element in accordance with the unique energy level available to the electron for occupation 1 study these spectral line have have an impact on a wide range of area in physic observe their position allows u to measure the distance and relative velocity of distant galaxy or the elemental composition of star 2 develop both the theoretical understand of these spectrum and the method to measure them then have be instrumental in progress scientific theory and knowledge of our universe central to this theoretical appreciation of atomic spectrum be the rydberg constant this constant describes the wavelength of light in the atomic spectrum relate them to the transition of electron result in the photon 's emission although discover by balmer and rydberg empirically it be the theoretical work by bohr which follow that give rydberg 's constant it real significance bohr prove that the constant be in fact a fundamental one by express it in term of other atomic fundamental see the next section -theory 3 amongst these constant be the fine structure constant α. this relation have lead to the rydberg constant have great importance in the field of quantum electrodynamics or qed the fine structure constant be central to qed a it be a measure of the electromagnetic couple strength at low energy 4 the rydberg constant can be determine with an extremely high level of accuracy 3 and a such enables great calculation of other fundamental constant especially in this case α. calculate constant to high degree of accuracy be often the best test for theory a have be the case for qed and allows much great theoretical prediction a such due to progress make measure rydberg 's constant qed be often consider the most accurate theory in modern science 5 this experiment aim to determine the value of rydberg 's constant use grate spectroscopic method the setup result and error analysis be all present a well a a critical analysis of the method and potential improvement a grate can be consider a large number of small equally space slit with a separation d. light passing through a grate form a diffraction pattern of maximum if the wavelength of the light be λ maximum occur where the phase difference between light wave come from the different slit be an integer m of 2π at this point the wave be in phase at the same relative position in their oscillatory cycle and constructive interference occurs in other word the light wave sum to produce brighter patch the path difference between two wave be the physical difference in distance that the wave have travel and be give by dsinθ a show in figure 1 where θ be the angle the light make with the grate the phase difference can be define in term of the path difference a therefore by substitute the requirement for the phase difference and the result found for the path difference and hence this be know a the grate equation unlike with simple two slit interference pattern the great number of slit in a grate mean that the maximum be much more distinct and separate by large area of darkness at all point other than determine rydberg 's constant by observe the emission spectrum of a hydrogen discharge lamp use a grate spectrometer w 3 the collimator be then focus so that a clear image be visible on the cross hair of the eyepiece in the telescope a minimum slit width be use to make sure the focus be good a large beam have less define edge make identify the point of focus more difficult the telescope be line up with the beam accurately use the fine motion knob the value read on the vernier scale at this position be record a this be the zero position about which other measurement be reference the telescope be then rotate exactly 90° measure use the vernier scale before place a grate of 80 line mm -1 in the holder the grate table be rotate so that a reflect image of the light beam be visible and align in the telescopeindicating a rotation of the grate of exactly 45° use the scale the grate be then rotate 45° these step ensure the grate be accurately set at an angle of 0° or normal to the collimator the sodium lamp be swap for the hydrogen lamp be use to take measurement the lamp be place a close to the slit at the end of the collimator a possible to reduce the amount of background light enter the system a possible the experiment be conduct in a dark laboratory however the lamp of colleague could still provide external light which have the potential to interfere with the diffraction pattern and the spectrum observe it be decide that both student would take measurement of the position of the maximum a this would help identify the human difference in reading the vernier scale and account for them in a statistical error four set of reading be take in total the telescope be move around the grate bed align with the spectral line accurately use the fine motion knob on the bed and the angle be read off the vernier scale in order to calculate the value of θ a label in figure 2 the zero position reading be subtract from the reading on the scale at the position of the line the angular position be record a a function of order for each of the three different colour spectral line visible red blue and violet because hydrogen lamp overheat and reduce in efficiency after extend use the discharge lamp be turn on whilst the telescope be move into position and secure and then turn off whilst the reading be take from the vernier scale this prevent the lamp from overheat and have to wait for it to cool there be some difficulty in accurately align the telescope with the centre of the high order maximum due to how faint they be in order to try and overcome this shield be use to block out a much background light a possible from the entire setup to provide a great contrast between the spectral line and the dark background reduce the error repeat the reading also aim to reduce the effect of this error in the case of the violet line the third order maximum be not always possible to see the experiment be complete over two week and during the first session the negative third order be not visible and in the second session the positive third order be not visible this be despite all condition and equipment be maintain a similar a possible this do mean that some data be collect for both positive and negative high order however only two reading be make rather than the four achieve for the rest of the colour and order before take result the slit width on the collimator be adjust so that high order maximum in the diffraction pattern be visible by widen the slit and allow more light to pa through however the slit could not be so wide that the beam be too large and undefined a this would add uncertainty to the measurement of their position at this point the diffraction grate be change from 80 line per mm to 300 line per mm a by consider equation 3 it be clear that a small gap between line a small value of d lead to a large angle between order a both m and λ remain constant the effect of this be to reduce the relative error in the measurement of the position the graph below show the average of the data collect for each colour line at each order where negative order and angle correspond to those in the direction define previously the error bar include on the plot have be calculate use the range of the data discussion of why this method be chosen follow later the error bar prove so small they be unclear on figure 3 so an example point be show in figure 4. linear trend line have be calculate use the least square method weight by the inverse of the error of each data point and plot on the graph a can be see from 3 the gradient of a line be 𝜆 𝑑 where d be know to be 3.33 × 10 −6 therefore the wavelength correspond to the light form the three different spectral line can be found these be found to be 653nm for red 483nm for blue and 432nm for the violet line use external resource 7 these wavelength be related to the electron transition produce these photon so the value of n in equation 4 be know the value of p be know to be 2 a this defines the balmer series therefore substitute in the related value of λ and n provide three value of the rydberg constant the mean average of these be take to produce the final result of 11030000 m -1 figure 3 -the sine of the angle to different order diffraction maximum for the red blue and violet spectral line from 3 the gradient of the line be 𝜆 𝑑 and the wavelength of the spectral line be found to be 653nm 483nm and 432nm respectively order e.g +1 and -1 +2 and -2 etc and checked that they be exactly the same a they should be if the grate be perfectly orthogonal to the incident light despite the angle in the result be similar they could have be even more accurate and this may have reduce the inaccuracy of the experiment there be other factor in the laboratory that be uncontrollable and would have have an effect on the accuracy of the experiment the air condition such a pressure temperature and importantly how they vary be not strictly control beyond the fact that the experiment be complete in the same lab for the two session vary pressure and temperature result in a change refractive index of the air which affect the path of the light travel through it and would change the angle record 8 although this effect be consider to be too small to have a significant effect during the practical procedure if the setup could be modify to be conduct in a vacuum any potential effect from the air would be remove,deep,bal
3,GS_HHM124_Redacted,in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the apparatus be already assemble my lab partner and i only have to do the calibration the diffraction grate in the experiment have 300 line per millimeter by analyze the data for interference line of each colour separately one can find it wavelength by relate the found wavelength to the appropriate change in energy level it be possible to find the rydberg constant use this method it be found that the value of the constant be 1.099 × 10 7 ± 2 × 10 4 𝑚 −1 the only great problem in this experiment be that there be probably light come from an outside source which we fail to distinguish from the hydrogen spectrum when measurement be take the main aim of this experiment be to obtain the rydberg constant while also learn how to use a grate spectrometer with the use of a spectrometer one can study the spectrum of light 1 this allows u to thereby deduce some property of luminous object or substance a grate spectrometer disperses light with a grate in which the slit be equally separate this produce an interference pattern which depends on the wavelength of the disperse light and on the distance between the several slit in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the observe interference pattern allow u to deduce the wavelength of photon which be produce by different transition between energy level in the hydrogen atom by relate the wavelength to the appropriate transition one can derive the rydberg constant and it uncertainty the grate be make of many slit which create an interference pattern for light of wavelength  the constructive interference will occur at 1 where 𝛩 be the angle at which the interference line be observe d be the distance between the slit and m be the order number an integer by find several angle at which interference occurs we can therefore accurately find also the wavelength of light furthermore the mention wavelength depends on the energy of the photon which be also the energy release by an atom make a transition from one energy level to another the wavelength be related to the transition between energy level by the rydberg equation 1 where r ∞ be rydberg 's constant n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level in our experiment we could only observe visible light which be part of the balmer series the balmer series be know to be create when atom drop down to the second energy level from any high energy level 1 hence we know that p will always be 2 for our case the n related to each wavelength will be guess by use our previous knowledge of how the colour of observe light be connect to the energy carry by photon by use 1 to find the wavelength and then substitute them into 2 while make reasonable guess of n we can therefore derive the rydberg constant the grate spectrometer we use consists of a collimator a table with a grate holder a camera and an eyepiece although we be give a function grate spectrometer my lab partner and i have to calibrate the instrument during calibration we use a sodium lamp a the light source since the hydrogen lamp overheats quickly we focus the eyepiece at a convenient view distance to minimize eye strain both my lab partner and i have to agree on the calibration since we want to take measurement independently crosschecking our data and thereby make sure that we do not make a mistake while reading the angle on the scale or align interference line with the cross wire in the eyepiece then we have to focus the camera lens on a point far away since the light from our source be collimate similar to light from a distant object this be do by point the camera across the room the object that we point it at be approximately 15 meter away and focus it in such a way that there be no parallax between the see image and the cross wire the camera have to point directly at the collimator to achieve this the camera be rotate by 90 degree so that it be at a right angle with respect to the collimator a mirror be place in the holder for the grate slight adjustment be make to position of the mirror until the reflect light be align with the cross wire this meant that the mirror be form an angle of 45 degree with both the collimator orientation and the camera orientation by rotate the camera back by 90 degree and the table with the holder by 45 degree the camera be point directly at the collimator and the grate would be perpendicular to their orientation the mention part be then clamped into position we also have to set the right height of the grate by take a quick look at the interference line we notice that the one at great angle be dimmer and be above the centre of the cross wire we use three screw in the table to adjust the height and orientation the table could be tilt because there be three screw so that the grate be not tilt and we could clearly see all the interference line when the setup be complete the sodium lamp be replace with the hydrogen lamp and we start take measurement a grate with 300 slit per mm be use in table 1 we can see all the interference line at what angle they occur and their colour we initially estimate the error for each measurement base on the difference between our record and the width of the interference line which be approximately 2 arcminute most of the error be in the range of 3 to 6 arcminute however there be some measurement be the uncertainty range do not cover the same value a the measurement on the opposite side with the opposite order number since this indicate that the error estimation have to be too small i decide to increase the error associate with the two measurement these error get large than i hop but fortunately there be at least three measurement for each colour that be quite accurate because the wavelength be calculate from the slope of the graph the error of the wavelength be not too large since the accurate measurement determine the slope to a great extent the wavelength of each colour be determine by plot a sin θ versus order number m. the error of sin θ be obtain by use the fact that at first i plot the sin θ versus order number line for all the colour on the same graph in python fig 2 but i also want to find the uncertainty of each slope since this be rather inconvenient in python i decide to use logger pro to find the minimum and maximum slope this method be show in appendix a. from 1 we can deduce that where k be the slope of the graph for one of the colour 𝜆 be the wavelength of light of that colour and d the distance between two slit the diffraction grate use in our experiment have 300 slit per millimeter with no uncertainty state i estimate it to be 0.5 of a slit per millimeter since otherwise the grate would have a different slit per unit length number state on it 2 we can see that all the wavelength match the true value except the wavelength for green light do not but there be a slight deviation of the mean value this might be due to systematic error most noticeable be the fact that the central line be not at exactly 0 degree but at 3 arcminute this indicates that the diffraction grate be not perfectly perpendicular although the angle by which it be deviate be small this could have cause a great change in the angle at which the interference pattern occur the green colour be not even close to any of the wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum and there be also quite large deviation of the data point from the best fit line most likely cause for it occurrence be that there be another element with hydrogen in the same lamp or that it occur because of another light source i be more inclined towards the latter explanation because it also explains why the uncertainty be so large if light be not come perpendicular to the grate the pattern will not be described perfectly by 1 from the wavelength obtain in table 2 it be possible to calculate the rydberg constant since it be already explain that the green colour wavelength do not match any of the value from literature it will not be use to obtain rydberg 's constant the other three wavelength will be use and we can expect to obtain very accurate value since the wavelength be also found to be accurate the final energy level in each case be 2 since all the emission line be part of the balmer series furthermore the initial energy level for each wavelength will be guess base on the fact that the energy of a photon be inverse proportional to the wavelength for example red light have the large wavelength hence it be produce by the low energy transition where the initial energy state be 3. blue light have slightly more energy hence the initial state be 4 and in the case of purple light the initial energy state be 5. equation 2 can be rearrange to obtain the rydberg constant i decide to write down the value for the constant to 9 significant figure since they will be use together to get the final result by take the average of the three value for each colour we obtain the follow result 𝑅 ∞ 10986233.4 ± 17863.9 𝑚 −1 ≅ 1.099 × 10 7 ± 2 × 10 4 𝑚 −1 6 the value of the constant found in literature be 𝑅 ∞ 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 2 the obtain value for the rydberg constant have the value from literature include in it uncertainty range we can conclude that the experimental procedure be appropriate and the error estimation be reasonable the aim of this experiment be to obtain the value of rydberg 's constant the experimental procedure be quite good because we have obtain an accurate value for the constant but there be still some possibility for improvement we should have definitely checked that we have observe the right colour since it turn out that one of the observe one be not come from hydrogen this be not a huge problem since the constant could still be derive from other colour furthermore we could have also minimize other error we could have repeat the calibration until the central interference line would be at exactly 0 degree because probably then we would have also see small difference between the measurement on opposite side the error on the distance between two slit be also probably an overestimation one way to low it would be two use light with know wavelength find it interference patter and calculate the distance between two slit with the associate uncertainty the great strength of the data analysis for this experiment in my opinion be use the sine of angle versus order number graph because it really help to low the uncertainty in the slope and consequently in the rydberg constant appendix a estimate the uncertainty of slope although the determination of uncertainty of slope be of central importance i decide to put in into in the appendix because it take a large amount of space logger pro be use to determine the uncertainty in slope at first all the data point with uncertainty be plot by use the `` model `` function under the `` analyze `` tab i be able to create an arbitrary best fit line and change it slope to see what be the great and low slope that could be plot through the error bar,expert,bal
4,GS_BSS023_Redacted,"the aim of this experiment be to provide a calculation for rydberg 's constant by use the emission line of hydrogen by observe red and aqua emission line the expect transition level for each and use the spectrometer equation we be able to obtain two very close value for rydberg 's constant and establish a final value and uncertainty for the red emission line we obtain a value of 𝟏𝟎 𝟕𝟕𝟐𝟏𝟑𝟒 ± 𝟎 𝟎𝟐𝟗𝟗𝟒𝟎 × 𝟏𝟎 𝟔 𝒎 −𝟏 and for the aqua emission line we obtain 𝟏𝟎 𝟕𝟗𝟒𝟐𝟖𝟎 ± 𝟎 𝟎𝟐𝟑𝟕𝟏𝟗 × 𝟏𝟎 𝟔 𝒎 −𝟏 .the percentage error be 0.28 and 0.22 respectively though neither value be within 𝝈 of the generally-accepted value for 𝑹 ∞ i. ascertain the elemental makeup of object be an important task in both research and industrial application thus if we be able to determine this composition by the emission or absorption spectrum of object we would have a non-invasive technique to determine their makeup rydberg 's constant enables u to make prediction a to the constituent element of object base just on their emission spectrum and it value be therefore an important experimental quantity to be determine calculate rydberg 's constant enables u to reliably determine the expect emission spectrum of different material and hence employ physical method in order to nondestructively determine the chemical composition of different compound we can also employ such technique to successfully determine the composition of otherwiseinaccessible object such a star 2 in order to determine rydberg 's constant 𝑅 ∞ we use a grate spectrometer first we experimentally determine the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission line use the grate equation we then experimentally determine the value of 𝑅 ∞ an atom be compose of a nucleus and an electronic shell depend on the element the atom can have multiple layer on it electronic shell each with a quantize energy level this mean that electron can not occupy energy state in between those level however when an atom be excite i.e when energy be impart upon it it electron can gain enough energy to transition to a level farther away from the nucleus afterward they will transition back to their original energy level and in the process release a photon of energy level equivalent to the energy difference energy gap between the electron 's transition level these emit photon constitute the atom 's emission spectrum we use rydberg 's constant to predict what sort of photon i.e predict their wavelength and energy a certain element 's spectrum will consist of 2 the grate spectrometer u a grate with 𝑁 slit to disperse incident light the light which pas through the grate will be deflect at an angle 𝜃 and will suffer from constructive and destructive interference due to their change in phase which will in turn create a certain interference pattern accord to theory this interference pattern will roughly resemble a succession of peak and valley the phase difference between neighbour ray be give by 1 the valley of the pattern correspond to the minimum of interference which occur for 𝑁 slit when the peak of this interference pattern correspond to the maximum of interference which occur when the phase difference be an integer multiple of 2n 1 c/ 2nm 2nm 2 dsin 0 5 accord to theoretical expectation we would expect any transition photon to obey the relation 6 where n and p be the number of the initial and final energy state of the atom equation 6 allows u to obtain an experimental value for rex give that we know the other quantity for our experiment p 2 in all case while n 3 for red light and n 4 for aqua light 4 in order to obtain j we can use the grate equation 1 where j be the w avelength of the spectral line d be the distance between two slit in our diffraction grate e be the angle at which an interference maximum occurs and m be the correspond order number the order number be an integer quantity and for the i th line of a specific colour observe after rotate the grate clockwise or anti-clockwise from the define start position i m thus m can take both negative and positive value accord to equation 7 if we plot sin 0 a a function of m we should obtain a linear plot from whose gradient we can extract j and calculate it associate error namely the gradient from we then use the covariance matrix our number of sample be large enough to use this method to find the uncertainty of this parameter r which we will call ay thus we obtain -from which we find 11 from equation 6 we find from this w e find the uncertainty in our value for r 00 our final result will be in the form before perform the experiment we have to calibrate the spectrometer so a to achieve a good resolution define a the resolve power at which both my lab partner and i be able to easily observe two give set of spectral emission line the process be perform use a sodium lamp since it do not run the risk of burning out and consist of the diffraction grate we use have 77.8 slit per millimetre and we found it to be best in achieve a good resolution in the spectrometer the actual experiment be do use a hydrogen lamp which allow u to observe hydrogen 's spectral emission line for increase accuracy the device use to measure the angle include a vernier scale so we be able to measure our result with ½ arcminute precision after establish the 0 𝑡ℎ order number we rotate the optical device clockwise and anticlockwise record the angle of diffraction and the order number we then process the data computationally create a line of best fit between the order number and the sine of the diffraction angle our experimental result confirm the expectation of the linear relationship between the order number and the sine of the angle at which interference maximum occur a be evident from the figure below however when plot the residual obtain when we subtract the expect value from the real value a nonlinear trend be observe which point to systematic error occur in our experimental setup therefore for the red and aqua maximum we obtain the percentage error on these value be 0.28 and 0.22 for red and aqua respectively which implies high statistical accuracy derive from the large sample base and low overall random error the random error which do exist be likely due to not reading the middle of the emission line accurately statistical error could be even far reduce by systematically building an even large database of measurement nevertheless our experimental range do not coincide or include the expect theoretical value for rydberg 's constant 3 𝑅 ∞ 10,973,731.6 𝑚 −1 10.9737316 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 this be likely due to systematic error affect the experiment some source of systematic error likely include misalignment of the optical piece tiny difference in air pressure and temperature cause slight change in the behaviour of the space through which light pas thereby introduce small error in our reading improve the experiment would require more stringent condition for perform it firstly the room in which the experiment be perform be not dark and might have cause u to miss some of the maximum associate with high order number a these be less visible when parasitic light upset the experimental setup moreover repeat the experiment several time would help improve confidence in the result an improve setup and procedure would be instead of use a manual rotate mechanism use a mechanical rotator and measure the angle of the emission maximum use a digital instrument write a program which can recognize the colour and order number of the emission maximum and thus build a digital database with reliable and highly precise measurement look to quantify systematic error from optical piece misalignment and the aforementioned difference in air pressure and temperature by mean of a different experiment so a to get a proper margin of error use a grate spectrometer we be able to precisely measure rydberg 's constant while thanks to the number of sample and thorough experimental procedure the statistical random error on our result be very small a outline in the previous section comparison with the generally accepted value for rydberg 's constant reveals that we have not measure it to an adequate level of accuracy this be due to the error discus above nonetheless have the value for rydberg 's constant enables u to perform theoretical research a well a to apply our knowledge to practical application in research spectroscopy can be use to determine the composition of star and other light-emitting object in industrial application spectroscopy can be use to non-destructively determine the exact chemical composition of material use in industrial application these application thus enable u to check assumption make in scientific research and theory a well a to aid in practical industrial

5,GS_FTZ138_Redacted,the excitation and subsequent deexcitation of an electron in an atom result in the emission of one or several photon the rydberg formula relates the difference in the energy state of the electron to the wavelength of the emit photon 1 and contains the rydberg constant hence by determine the wavelength emit and the respective energy transition cause them complete here for hydrogen an accurate value for the rydberg constant can be found the final value determine be 1.07x10 7 ± 6.69x10 4 m -1 which have a difference of 2.42 to the current accepted value a standard grate spectrometer be use to measure the angle of diffraction of the emission line from a hydrogen lamp which allow the wavelength of each line to be calculate the inverse of the wavelength be plot against a function of it correspond excite principal quantum number and the gradient be use to calculate the rydberg constant he balmer series be discover in 1885 and be described by a purely empirical formula relate the inverse wavelength of the emission line see from a hydrogen discharge lamp to a series of integer this formula be then generalize by johannes robert rydberg in 1889 but it be only after development in the atomic model by niels bohr in 1913 that the formula could be explain by theory 1 the derivation for this formula be write in the appendix of this report the balmer series only applies to photon emit in the visible spectrum due to electron deexciting to principal quantum number n 2. however the generalisation can be use to describe other series such a the lyman series of ultraviolet line due to deexcitation to n 1 and can also easily be modify to suit any nucleus 2 where λ be the emit wavelength z be the atomic number of the atom be excite in the case for hydrogen z 1 r∞ be the rydberg constant and n1 and n2 be the principal quantum number of the initial and excite state of the electron respectively n2 n1 the rydberg constant be currently one of the most accurately-measured physical constant with a recommend relative uncertainty of 6.6x10 -12 3 it be an extremely important and relevant constant because it be inherently link to the fine structure constant among several other fundamental constant which can be test for consistency in various physical system hence verify the accuracy of the theory 4 the experimental method use here to determine it value be relatively simple a hydrogen discharge lamp be use to emit various wavelength of light correspond to different energy change due to electron deexciting from different energy level three different wavelength be emit and see through the telescope of a grate spectrometer a each wavelength have diffract by a different amount the grate equation where λ be the wavelength d be the distance between each slit in the grate θ be the angle to the central maximum that a maximum be see and m be the order of diffraction be then use to calculate the wavelength of each emit colour this be do by plot the sine of the angle to the central maximum that a maximum be observe against the order at which the angle be observe multiply the gradient of the resultant graph by d give the wavelength this be repeat for each colour until the three wavelength be found in order to carry out a second plot to determine the value of r∞ the value of n2 for each correspond wavelength have to be found because electron be deexciting to energy level 2 it be deduce that value of n2 have to be 3 4 and 5. the large the difference between n1 and n2 the more energy be emit a light and hence the low the wavelength a plot be make of the inverse wavelength against − and the gradient -which be equal to the value of r∞ -was found the grate spectrometer use be a standard student spectrometer comprise of a collimator telescope and rotatable mount focus knob be use to focus the eyepiece and collimator the eyepiece be focus so that an object a simple mark on an illuminate blank sheet of paper held up against a wall around 30cm away be see clearly and the telescope be focus on an illuminate marker approximately 9m away this be a good enough approximation for the object to be at an `` infinite `` distance so that no parallax be observe blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk t a sodium lamp a then place by the slit to focus the collimator and find the optimal slit width the reason for use this lamp be because a hydrogen lamp which be use for the rest of the experiment would be prone to overheat if left active for large period of time the lamp would have to be continuously run so the time take to focus the collimator be far great than that of take individual measurement a similar procedure be carry out regard the focus the instrument this time focus on an image of the emission spectrum of sodium the lamp initially glowed purple rather than the characteristic orange of sodium due to a small amount of radon present in the lamp before the sodium be completely vapourised the slit width be then low so that the line width observe be low this be do because the width of the line could be use a a measure of uncertainty the angle of the line to the central maximum would be measure at the centre of the line so if the line be wider the measurement be more likely to deviate from the centre of the line ensure that the telescope be precisely 180° to the collimator by line up the centre of the line with the centre of the eyepiece crosswire the vernier scale on the grate table be use to rotate the telescope through 90°00 ± 03 the small realistic value that could be read off the scalewhich read to the near arc-minute and clamped in position the collimator and telescope be then perpendicular to each other the reading on the vernier scale at this point be 15°54 a 300 line/mm grate be place in the rotatable mount at the centre of the grate table this grate a chosen over the 80 line/mm option because in order to calculate the wavelength the grate equation be use assume the error in angle be constant e.g due to resolution of the vernier scale maximise the angle will lead to the minimisation of percentage uncertainty associate with the angle this can be do by increase d in the grate equation in order for the grate to be exactly perpendicular to the collimate incident light the grate be rotate until the reflection of the emission line be see in the telescope this ensure that the grate be 45° to both the collimator and telescope so by add 45°00 to the angle above the grate be position precisely perpendicular to the incident light the telescope be then rotate back to the central maximum of the diffraction pattern the process be repeat for the hydrogen lamp this be do relatively quickly and the lamp do not overheat with the central maximum be at 211°45 and a width of 0°55 212°13 -211°18 table 1.1 to 1.3 below be present a such because each of the three colour violet cyan red be analyse separately to give a distinct wavelength only the mean measure angle be give and the central maximum be observe at angle 211°45 with a width of 0° 55 the width be use a an estimate of uncertainty in θ base on the idea that measurement to the centre of any line can only be make accurate to ± one quarter of the width of the line this be because it be estimate that the angle actually measure would only fall into half the width either side of the true centre of the line the sine of the width of the central maximum be use a the uncertainty in θ when plot sin θ against order however this value be not use in any calculation because it be only a very rough not even take into account the width of the other maximum suggestion a to how uncertainty could be measure fig 1.1 5 a basic pasco model student spectrometer that could be use to determine the wavelength of spectral emission from a hydrogen lamp fig 1.2. show a sodium lamp and spectrometer where the diffraction grate be 45° to both the collimator and telescope this be to ensure it will be precisely perpendicular to the incident light after be rotate precisely 45° clockwise in this case a can be see the angle measure at an order be roughly equal to the angle of the opposite order this agrees with what should be see a the interference pattern be symmetrical about the central maximum furthermore when determine the fit of the line a small value for intercept found for each fit for cyan and red this be of the order -10 -4 and for violet be 10 -3 although this be negligible compare to other source of uncertainty such a the width of the line it do suggest that a slight systematic error may be present one source could be due to the diffraction grate not be precisely perpendicular to the incident light hence result in the modify grate equation where θi be the angle of incidence to the grate this lead to an intercept of -sin θi because the intercept be small and a mixture of both positive and negative value this implies that the grate may have be rotate first in one direction for cyan and red and then in the opposite direction for violet possibly due to a component not be clamped firmly in place the value of the intercept be negligible but worth note here the scipy library also allows for the fit of a line to be calculate the output of which be displayed in the table below scipy be also able to output the covariance matrix which can be use to determine the uncertainty in the gradient and intercept let m represent the gradient of the line for the plot above firstly this allows the wavelength to be found by simply multiply the gradient by the constant d 10 -3 300 m and secondly since the uncertainty in m be give by the root of the first value in the covariance matrix the uncertainty in λ can be calculate by multiply the uncertainty in m by the partial derivative of the right-hand side of equation 3 with respect to m which be simply bohr use the idea that electron could only occupy allow energy level in an atom and can only move between them if give or release the same energy a a photon a the difference between the two level initial i and final f because bohr 's model propose that electron can only emit energy when transition between energy level an electron could move in a stable orbit around the nucleus without emit energy hence the magnitude of the electron 's angular momentum would have to be quantize such that where me be the rest mass of the electron h be planck 's constant n be an integer represent the principal quantum number and rn and vn be the radius and speed of the electron at orbit n. bohr 's simplify model of the electron orbit in a circular orbit around a far large proton meant he could equate the coulomb force to the centripetal force act on the electron at orbit n where e be the magnitude of the charge of the electron and c d be the permittivity of free space solve equation 2 and 3 simultaneously give the follow expression for the radius and speed of an electron at principal quantum number n and 5 the total energy of the electron be the sum of it kinetic and potential energy and by again assume that the electron maintains a stable orbit around a proton be give by it be easily see that this reduces to a change in n from ni to nf will correspond to a change in energy of ei to ef use 1 and 7,superficial,exp
6,GS_BYH124_Redacted,this report present a method which make use of the grate spectrometer for study the spectmm of light of a hydrogen lamp and use this spectmm to determine the rydberg constant the

be use to produce pru•allel beam of light the prism table be use to suppo1t the grate between the collimator and telescope there the grate disperse the light into it different component colour there be also a vemier-calliperlike compass below the prism table on the rotate base which allows u to measure angle see the theory sect.ion for more detail if we look through the eyepiece we can see these different component a well a the original light the screw at b c d and e be use to lock a setup use for the experiment in place 3 a hydrogen lamp be a slim tube consist of two electrode one at each end the lamp contains hydrogen gas at low pressure if we apply a high voltage across the electrode a bright pink glow be enutted by the tube only certain colour can be see with naked eye through the eyepiece when the light be pas through a grate because the other colour be either in the infra-red or ultra-violet region of the light spectmm 4 figure 2 show on the right the light emit by the hydrogen lamp when no grate be present and on the left the three colour which can be see with the spectrometer when the pink light pas through a grate 5 a principal maximum be a region where the intensity of a diffract light passing through a grate be the high l l page whereas a minimum be where the intensity of the diffract light be low principal maximum occur when the phase difference between adjacent ray of a light of wavelength λ be an integer multiple m of 2π where m be the order number 6 the formula for the phase difference be give by the path difference be d sin θ and therefore we obtain the phase angle of the first minimum with n slit illuminate be give by transition wavelength in hydrogen be give via where r∞ be the rydberg constant and n and p be integer represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the atom respectively 6 equation 4 give the balmer series in hydrogen with p 2 and n 3 4 5 ... depend on the colour of the spectrum the band theory suggests that in the atom of a gas the electron orbit the nucleus in a set of energy level 8 by supply sufficient energy to the electron the electron can translate from a low energy level to a high one depend of the distance between the low n 2 and high level n 3 4 5 ... and so depend on the amount of energy supply to the electron we say that electron on high energy level be in the excite state however these excite electron can not remain 'excited for ever and so they eventually fall back to their original energy level in do so the electron emit a packet of energy know a a photon of a certain wavelength transition wavelength 9 for the balmer series the transition wavelength in hydrogen be in the visible part of the spectrum before start the experiment with the hydrogen lamp the spectrometer need to be calibrate prior the eye piece be make to focus on the cross-hair by adjust the screw on the telescope the set should cause a little strain on the eye a possible the camera lens be then focus on a distant object say a building 's window which should be 5 to 10 metre away so a there be no parallax between the image and the cross-hair after this adjustment the telescope be align with the axis of the collimator a sodium lamp be use for the last part of the spectrometer calibration instead of the hydrogen lamp itself because unlike the hydrogen lamp the line spectrum of the light from the monochromatic sodium lamp do not fade away a the lamp get hotter therefore there be no need to rush when calibrate the spectrometer and so we can calibrate the figure 3 show the path difference between two neighbour light ray when a light pas through a grate slit with space d 7 figure 4 represent the balmer transition in a hydrogen atom for different initial state n 3 4 5 6 and final state p 2 depend on the initial state level assort colour be see 10 figure 5 show the setup of the grate spectrometer light from the source pas through the collimator and come out of it a parallel beam the light then pas through the grate where it be diffract into it component use the telescope which can be rotate a magnify image of the different order can be see 11 1 2 with the sodium lamp light on the slit at the collimator be open slightly and the focus of the collimator be adjust until we obtain a sharp image of one of the order at the cross-hair look at the scale of angle on the rotate base the telescope be rotate precisely 90 degree and be fix in that position this scale consists of a main scale 0° -360° which be in degree and a vemier scale o -30 which be in minute just like with a standard vemier calliper the vemier zero be the reference division when reading on the main scale then the vernier scale division which coincides with one of the main scale division be use to calculate the final angle 1 minute on the vemier scale equal to 60° on the main scale 12 let u say for instance we deliberately coincide the vemier zero scale with the 160° main scale division to tum the telescope by 90° the 50° division on the main scale should coincide with the vemier zero division which should remain in a fix position that be only the main scale should be rotate retuming to the spectrometer calibration a suitable grate be place on the table between the collimator and the telescope the grate use in this experiment have approximately 78.8 line per mm 6 the table be rotate until a reflect image of the entrance slit can be see in the eyepiece this usually occurs when the plane of the grate be at 45° a from the collimator axis the telescope be then move around until we get a diffract image of the slit at an enough large angle of diffraction ohl h• ... `` `` `` to left on plane of paper 13 we consider order to the right anticlockwise of the zero order to be positive while order on the right clockwise to b e negative to minimise en-ors when take measurement of angle it be well to measure the angle of the order on both side of the zero order the data for the order number and their con-esponding position from the zero order of the sodium lamp s light be tabulate use these data a graph of d sin 0 against order m eq.2 be plot use a computer with the program language python by write some function both the gradient of the graph and the uncertainty in the gradient can be obtain on the computer the gradient of the graph give u a .. if the calculate wavelength of the light be between 589.0 run and 589.6 run 6 then the spectrometer have be accurately calibrate and so we can begin the ma.in experiment with the hydrogen lamp after have obtain the wavelength of the different colour from the hydrogen lamp with the same method mention in the previous paragraph a graph of 1/ a. against 1/n 2 -1/p 2 eq.4 be plot and the gradient uncertainty can b e obtain use python the gradient of this graph give u the negative of the rydberg 's constant the wavelength of sodium obtain in this experiment be 878 ± 180 run the latter do not fall in the range between 589.0 run and 589 .6 run even if we consider the uncertainty associate with it this prof that the calibration be not properly do or/and there be lot of systematic e1rnrs the graph figure 7 below show the straight-line relationship of d sin 0 against order m. for the second graph figure 8 which depicts the plot of the three visible component of hydrogen the w avelength obtain for the red component be 67 1 ± 82 run that of the blue component be 480 ± 140 nm and finally the wavelength of the violet component be 625 ± 120 nm the wavelength of the red and blue l • determine the wavelength of hydrogen emission spectrum component fall in the officially accepted range which be between 622 nm -780 run and betv.•een 455 nm -492 nm respectively 14 if we consider the uncertainty associate with them how ever the calculate value for the violet co~ponent do not fall in the range 390 run -455 nm 14 which mean there be lot of source of eitor during it measurement the intersection of the line give an indication how accurately the grate spectrometer w a calibrate the closer the intersection be to the zero-order m the well the calibration of the grate spectrometer be ultimately the gradient of the final graph figure 9 which be a plot of 1/ a against l/n 2 -l/p 2 give u the negative of the rydberg constant for the red colour n 3 for the blue colour n 5 and for the violet one n 6 10 thus the positive value of the latter obtain computationally be then the main aim of the experiment be to detennine the rydberg constant roo use a hydrogen lamp and the grate spectroscopy method a sodium lamp be use durin the calibration of the grate spectrometer during the experiment there be a lot of problem and systematic eitors w e encounter and this can be show that our result obtain for the rydberg constant 3.45 ± 1.03 x 10 6 m-1 be very far from the officially accepted value 1 0 973 731.6 m-1 5 the first problem be that after sometimes it become ve1y difficult to position accurately the cross-hair on the violet ~olow spectrum of the hydrogen light due to the ve1y low light m tens1ty we could not even see the cross-hair through the eyepiece secondly we knew during the experiment that a the hydrogen lamp get more and more hot the colour component of the latter fade away and so we decide to tum the lamp off for the lamp to cool down however when we try to tum it on again the lamp never light on • again and so we have to change our hydrogen lamp therefore i think that take measurement of the violet colour from another hydrogen lamp induced significant uncertainty in our result the third problem be that it be quite difficult to read the scale on the spectrometer rotate base even use a loop equip with a light bulb while try to read the scale of angle it cause some eye-strained to address the first and second problem a deuterium lamp can be use to detemune the rydberg constant instead of a hydrogen lamp because the deuterium lamp give great intensity and have a longer life even though it cost more 15 the third problem can be solve by use a grate spectrometer which have a digital scale of angle so that the measurement of the position of the order be more accurate and easy to read even though we do not get the result we hop for this experiment taught u how to calibrate a grate spectrometer how to use it to determine the rydberg constant and how difficult it be to determine the latter to high accuracy,superficial,the
7,GS_TGO908_Redacted,10 900 000 ± 232 000 m-1 chemical element emit discrete frequency of electromagnetic radiation when atom go from a high energy state to a low energy state the transition of electron from a high energy level eu to a low energy level el cause the emission of photon with energy a diffraction grate can separate frequency of this electromagnetic radiation when a beam of light be incident upon it give unique emission spectrum for each element this be possible because distinct wavelength of light deviate from the central maximum by different amount the formula relates the wavelength 𝜆 of light from a maximum in the emission spectrum to the principal quantum number 𝑛 𝑈 and 𝑛 𝐿 where 𝑛 𝑈 be the high energy level and 𝑛 𝐿 be the low energy level r represent the rydberg constant whose value we to derive use a spectrum of hydrogen in this experiment the frack-hertz experiment 1 portrayed the existence of energy level by investigate the motion of electron in mercury vapour electron orbit the nucleus at fix radius and spectral line be of discrete wavelength imply that the magnitude of an electron angular momentum be quantise 2 mathematically represent a this be far corroborate when instead of a particle approach we take a wave approach to the atomic model where electron be stand wave with wavelength 𝜆 𝑛 a distance 𝑟 𝑛 away from the nucleus for a stand wave to be feasible the wavelength in a circular orbit should be a whole number n 1 2 3 … use 4 and de broglie 's relationship for wavelength and momentum 3 can be derive in hydrogen the force require to cause centripetal acceleration of the electron around the proton be provide by the electrical attraction between the two negatively charge particle combine coulomb 's law and newton 's second law give u the equation simultaneously equate 3 and 5 give value for 𝑟 𝑛 and 𝑣 𝑛 that can be use to obtain the total energy for the n th orbit in the bohr model en which can conventionally be write a where r be the rydberg constant the rydberg formula 2 can very simply give the wavelength of the radiation emit when electron transition energy level in this experiment the high energy level 𝑛 𝑈 from which the electron de-excites be 3 4 and 5 with the photon colour be red blue and violet respectively in the laboratory we determine the rydberg constant by shin a hydrogen lamp through a spectrometer to obtain an emission spectrum the spectrometer use consist of a collimator and telescope between which the diffraction grate be place a light from the source pas through the slit into the collimator a beam of parallel light ray be produce 3 incident on the diffraction grate in accordance with huygens principle 4 the beam of light disperses into a spectrum accord to huygens each point the grate spectrometer -rydberg constant despite the same person reading the scale in addition to the ± 3ʹ error from reading the value there would be a far ± 3ʹ error due to any fault in set up the spectrometer for the red and blue line the slit width be extremely narrow result in a negligible error due to a wide slit for the violet spectral line we measure the difference in angle between one end of the band to the other to be 1ʹ when graph these error be very inconspicuous after obtain value for 𝜃 for different order number n plot graph for 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against n give straight line for each wavelength due to the proportional relationship between them with a gradient use the covariance matrix in python the graphical uncertainty show in table ii can be calculate along with value for the rydberg constant in table i the error from measure and incorrect calibration be much high than these value meaning they be more significant than the statistical error from table i the average rydberg constant can be calculate a 10 863 637 m -1 the uncertainty from table ii table iii and the standard error from the mean calculation add in quadrature give the uncertainty correspond with the average rydberg constant which be 231 705 m -1 therefore the result of the experiment be 10 900 000 ± 232 000 𝑚 −1 there be a possibility if the set up of the spectrometer have go significantly wrong that there be a substantial systematic error in the value calculate a way to recognise the systematic error would be to repeat the experiment with different equipment and set up the spectrometer again another way to analyse the result obtain be to realise that the beam at order number n 1 and n -1 be symmetrical about the zero-order beam path therefore the value 𝜃 for both these order be the same this give u two value for each order from which an average angular deviation can be found however these can not be use to calculate the standard error for each order wavelength additionally this method of analysis do not require graphical representation of the result at all an example of this method be use with the red spectral line be show in table iv from here an average wavelength for the specific colour can be compute and then this can be substitute into the rydberg formula in this method of analysis there be statistical uncertainty due to work out the mean instead of the graphical uncertainty from the initial method the standard error of the wavelength be manipulate to become the error in the rydberg constant calculate use each of the three wavelength far manipulation of the uncertainty and the value for the rydberg constant the result determine by this analysis method be 10 900 000 ± 244 000 𝑚 −1 this value be relatively similar to the one calculate from the previous analysis the difference be that the uncertainty in this method be slightly great this could be due to the addition of the standard error in calculation the standard error in inversely proportional to the square root of the number of data sample a way to improve the uncertainty in this method be to increase the number of data sample in this experiment the value obtain for the rydberg constant be in the same magnitude a the measure value also it be consistent to 2 significance level however there be many improvement which can be make so that the error associate with this value be decrease firstly obtain more data would mean the value for the deviation angle be more reliable also it would allow an average to be calculate this reduces the chance of anomaly in calculation which could be due to misjudgement of the vernier scale even though an average can be calculate by use the second analysis in the result section the number of total data point remain the same so the anomaly can not be recognise and omit a well a possible also calculate the standard error with a sample of 2 will give a large error contribution secondly increase the width of the slit for the violet spectral line cause a high contribution of uncertainty to the final value a way to improve would be to remove any other source of light present in the space around u this would increase the contrast between the black background and violet spectral line the rydberg constant be useful because it be part of an elegant formula that allows the transition wavelength to be calculate easily,superficial,bal

one of the few where we can observe at our macroscopic scale phenomenon have a quantum origin indeed we observe that atom light emission be quantify to specific wavelength this observation lead u to discus the dual nature of light this experiment u the effect of light diffraction see ii.a to look at what happens inside the atom the rydberg constant be one of the fundamental physical constant and be today know to 14 decimal place 1 use a grate spectrometer see fig 2 to look at the emission ray of hydrogen atom come from a hydrogen lamp see fig 2 we aim to calculate the rydberg constant this very precise instrument use in a dark room allow u to limit noisy light to a minimum level a. about the grate spectrometer consider light a wave we know that white light be a superposition of all the visible colour 3 indeed it be compose of wave of wavelength from 400 nm to 700nm we can decompose any light into it different wavelength use either a prism or a grate in our case we use a grate which be a transparent piece of glass which contain a very large number of equally space narrow line when light shine through a grate it be diffract by the line and light change it path by an angle θ give by 2𝜋 𝜆 d sin 𝜃 2𝜋m 2 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the light d be the space between two line of the grate and m be the number of the ray from the central ray when light go through an obstacle of a width of the same magnitude a it wavelength it get diffract 4 because of this phenomenon of diffraction the ray be displace from the straight path and appear a thin ray repeat themselves a we turn the telescope the light 's maximum intensity which be the ray we see be locate at 2𝜋m m be the number of the ray 2 rearrange 1 we have 2 we can therefore see that a beam of light contain different wavelength get separate into ray of a specific wavelength shift from the straight path by an angle θ depend on their wavelength accord to bohr 's model 5 atom be compose of a central nucleus compose of both proton and neutron and of a set of layer contain a define number of electron depend on the energy they carry the electron can pa from one `` layer `` call level of energy to another this change of level of energy be call a `` quantum leap `` if the electron jump from a low level of energy to a high one it absorbs energy in the form of a photon particle of light of a particular wavelength reversely an energise electron will quickly 5 return to a low level of energy by emit it excess of energy in the form of a photon of the wavelength correspond to the one of the photon it initially absorbed in the quantum theory everything be quantify that be why we be in presence of specific wavelength and energy level the hydrogen lamp function accord to this quantum theory indeed the lamp contains hydrogen atom see fig 2 that be excite by the heating of the lamp and emit light of specific wavelength when the atom be deexciting come back to low energy level 5 the hydrogen atom emits ray both visible ultraviolet and infrared the visible ray be give by the balmer series 2 and correspond to transition from the high energy level 6 th to 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level the visible ray be show in fig 1. visible wavelength emit by a hydrogen atom from left to right the ray correspond to transition from the 6 th to the 2 nd energy level from the 5 th to the 2 nd from the 4 th to the 2 nd and from the 3 rd to the 2 nd 2 c. about the rydberg constant measure the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw the rydberg constant r ∞ relates the transition between level of energy to the wavelength of the emit or absorbed photon for a transition between level n to level p n p we have where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the emit photon accord to the theory we should be able to distinguish 3 different ray of light with different wavelength each correspond to a specific transition in the hydrogen atom we be also suppose to see these ray repeat themselves a few time a we rotate the spectrometer r ∞ be also give by where 𝑚 e be the rest mass of the electron 𝜀 0 be the permittivity of free space 𝑒 be the electron 's charge 𝑐 be the speed of light in vacuum and ℎ be plank 's constant the accepted value for this fundamental constant be 1.097 373 156 8508 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 1 note in the case of the hydrogen atom the value of the rydberg constant be slightly different a it have to take into account the effect of the central proton 6 in the case of the hydrogen atom the rydberg constant r h be give by r h e h hc 6 5 where e h be the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom h be the planck 's constant and c the speed of light in vacuum however the difference be too small to be apprehend at our level of precision and we will therefore calculate r ∞ first of all we have to set up our spectrometer a show in fig 2. after understand what the principal piece be we start to look at the light emit by a sodium lamp we do not use the hydrogen lamp to set up the apparatus a it heat up quickly and tends to shut down after 15 to 20 minute of use to determine what be the straight path of light we place the 78.8 lines/mm grate at 45° of the incoming light we turn the rotate arm of the spectrometer until the light reflect by the grate be visible see ii.a we take note of the position of the arm know from the law of reflection that the reflection angle be the same a the incident angle we deduct that our straight path be at 45° to this measurement we deduce that our spectrometer be align when the rotate arm be at 349.42° when observe the spectrum of emission of the hydrogen lamp we observe 3 different colour red light blue and purple the purple be harder to see than the other colour rotate our telescope we saw that the ray repeat themselves multiple time a predict by the theory see ii.a regard the allocate time and the fact that we could not have the hydrogen lamp light for a very long time we chose to take 3 time the same set of measurement let the lamp cool down between measurement for each colour we chose to measure the angle of diffraction of the 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd ray go to the left correspond respectively to 𝑚 1 2 3 and of the correspond ray go to the right 𝑚 −1 −2 −3 a well a of the central ray 𝑚 0 we therefore aim to have 21 measurement per colour if we have have more time we would have measure the 4 th ray for each colour to the left and to the right three time for each colour rather than take a fourth time 7 measurement for each colour we be indeed interested in the overall trend of the ratio 𝑚/ sin 𝜃 and not in the particular angle 𝜃 at which be locate each ray because of noisy light in the room the purple ray be really faint and hence hard to see sometimes we be not sure if the ray we be observe be the second or the third purple ray another probable source of error be also that we do n't see the difference between two violet wavelength indeed we saw very faint purple line and we estimate that they be all of the same wavelength but accord to theory we should have have two violet ray we therefore chose to make measurement for the purple ray keep in mind that they have a high degree of uncertainty and that we could and probably should not use them when calculate the value of the rydberg constant we try to get the purple ray a bright a possible by measure them last when the hydrogen lamp be hotter and the ray brighter a more atom would deexcite in the same time however it be not good enough we manage to take only one measurement of the ray -2 and 2 and only 2 measurement of the ray -3 and 3. we estimate that we have an error of ±15 arc minute on measurement -2 and 2 we indeed ca n't determine statistically the error despite poor light condition the grate spectrometer be overall very precise for this kind of experiment indeed because of the slit situate on the light 's path and because of the process of interference the ray of light be situate in a small region of space this help in the precision so do the cross-wire see fig 2 two thin black line cross each other in the centre of the lens that help centre the measurement exactly in the centre of the ray another feature of the spectrometer that improves greatly precision be the vernier scale this apparatus be precise to 1 which corresponds to a precision of 0.02° put together the different measurement and use the statistical method to determine the error we obtain the result show in table i where 𝜃 blue be the angle of the blue ray subtract the value of each ray 's position to the value of the central ray we find the relative angle of displacement of each ray take the sine of the angle of the relative angle of displacement and plot it against the ray number we obtain the graph give in fig 3 a b and c use 2 on the measurement summarise in table i the value of d calculate in 5 and obtain error use the statistical method we calculate the value of the wavelength of each colour a be 𝜆 red 6.67 ± 0.19 × 10 −7 𝑚 𝜆 blue 4.95 ± 0.05 × 10 −7 𝑚 and 𝜆 purple 4.95 ± 0.31 × 10 −7 𝑚. a we can see our measurement for the purple wavelength seem wrong a they have a high uncertainty and be not coherent a we calculate the same wavelength for the blue and purple set of ray this comfort the hypothesis make in section iii b that the measurement of purple ray be unprecise and should not be use in far calculation a we have see in part section ii.b the blue ray correspond to a transition from level 4 to level 2. rearrange 3 we have take 𝜆 𝜆 blue n=2 and p=4 we can calculate an experimental value of 𝑅 ∞ 𝑅 ∞ blue 1.08 ± 0.01 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 similarly the red ray correspond to a transition from the 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level use 𝜆 red n=2 and p=3 and 6 we find 𝑅 ∞ red 1.08 ± 0.03 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 take the mean of these two value and the mean error we find our experimental value for the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ exp 1.08 ± 0.02 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 we estimate that the error come from different source firstly a part of our error come from a move of the grate that result in a misalignment of the spectrometer indeed we see that our central ray the one not be deflect be n't always at the same position use statistical mean to calculate error we find that this central ray be locate at 168.85 ± 0.05° we can therefore estimate our error a be 0.05° furthermore if the vernier scale allow u a great precision it be also sometimes a bit hard to read we consider that we have a random error of ±3 ′ on the measurement use the vernier scale of each angle because of the parallax effect and the bad visibility in the dark room we also estimate that we have an error of ±2.5 on the determination of the ray position indeed we measure that the width of our ray be 10 we consider that we know whether we be closer to one of the border or to the centre of the ray but we ca n't really determine if we be at ¼ of the ray or at ½ of it therefore our error here be the quarter of the ray width 10/4 2.5 we also have source of error in the fact that the spectrometer might have move horizontally and would not be exactly in front of the slit anymore this a well a the background light present in the room during the experiment reduce the relative brightness of the observe ray and cause u to cast out our measurement of the purple ray finally environmental condition such a the ambient humidity temperature and air pressure probably influence the behaviour of the hydrogen atom however they be difficult to estimate and we consider that they be negligible ideally we could determine their magnitude by do the experiment in different meteorological condition however it seem really difficult to do it practise because of the multiple vary factor humidity temperature noisy light ... that prevent u from repeat the experiment in the exact same condition add all the estimate error we find an error of 0.14° which corresponds to an error in the wavelength of 0.18 × 10 −7 𝑚 which be small than our error on the red wavelength but still of the same order of magnitude we therefore chose our measure value for the error a they be big than the estimate one the accepted value of the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 1 lie within our margin of error our estimate for the rydberg constant be 𝑅 ∞ exp 1.08 ± 0.02 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 and be coherent with the theory we observe that the hydrogen atom emits only at certain wavelength which be coherent with the quantum picture and the description of light a a particle in the experiment we also experienced diffraction of light through the grate a phenomenon more easily explain by a wave-like picture of light this experiment be one of the few that relates quantum mechanic to optic allow u to encounter the wave-particle duality because we use a very precise apparatus we have less than a 2 error in our value for the constant this error come at 35 from a displacement from alignment at 35 from a unprecise reading of the vernier scale and at 30 from a difficult determination of the ray position the condition of experience brightness temperature humidity air pressure… played a role a they prevent u from make use of the purple ray a well a be source of systematic error however they ca n't be estimate use this sole experiment we could determine their magnitude by repeat the experiment in different meteorological condition the strength of this experiment be it precision the comprehensive view of the atom it give and the link it make between quantum mechanic and optic thanks to the precise apparatus we use this experiment be successful however it can be strongly improve by make it in a proper dark room with a more powerful hydrogen lamp that would allow u to measure the two purple set of ray a well a the blue and red one more precisely calculate the constant use 4 wavelength would indeed be more precise we could also measure a 4 th and even a 5 th ray from the central ray to improve our precision even far,superficial,the
9,GS_VLS445_Redacted,a of recent time the rydberg be one of the most accurately measure fundamental physical constant this report review how the rydberg constant be calculate use a grate spectrometer this be the primary aim of the experiment another aim be to become familiar with a spectrometer and how it can be use in different way to study spectrum a spectrometer be use to analyse a spectrum of light from a know source by take measurement of the angle between spectrum line and use knowledge of balmer transition the formula for the rydberg constant be solve a value of 2.088e+07𝒎 −𝟏 +/-1.087e+07𝒎 −𝟏 be obtain he rydberg constant be a fundamental constant which be very important in atomic physic it be name after the swedish physicist johannes rydberg who developed the formula use in this lab report to obtain a value for this constant the constant describes the wavelength of the photon of light emit a spectral line in transition in the balmer series the easy atom to study be the hydrogen due to their simple structure this be why a hydrogen lamp be use in this experiment in the lamp be hot electrically excite hydrogen gas this cause it to emit a spectrum that 's concentrate only at a few specific wavelength the space between these bright line provide data which can be use to draw many conclusion include the conclusion of this experiment spectroscopy be a highly successful and powerful technique due to the fact that it be non-invasive the other piece of equipment use be the grate spectrometer this be an instrument use to study the spectrum of light emit by the hydrogen lamp it u a lens to produce a collimate beam of light a diffraction grate disperses this beam due to it series of very fine groove cut in it surface the disperse beam be then focus by the camera onto the eyepiece of the spectrometer the spectrometer be make up of three component a collimator a diffraction grate and a telescope this be show in the schematic diagram below the light from the hydrogen lamp enters through an adjustable slit which be use to focus the camera this will be explain in the method the slit be strategically position at the focal point of the collimator to ensure that all the light passing through the diffraction grate be one parallel collimate beam of light all beam have the same angle of incidence the diffraction grate be simplify to a large number of equally space very narrow slit this cause the beam to disperse and the pattern be picked up at the telescope the diffraction angle depends on the wavelength of the light this be illustrate by the follow equation where d be the slit separation sin 𝜃 be the sin of the angle between adjacent emission line m be an integer and 𝜆 be the specific wavelength of that colour of light this equation implies a straight line when sin 𝜃 be plot against m. this allows for the wavelength and their uncertainty to be determine from the gradient and error bar which be calculate use python the diagram below show the diffraction patter for 4 slit the balmer series be the series of visible line which a discharge lamp emits the formula to describe these line be found by johaan balmer and be give by where n and p be integer represent the initial and final state of the atom the value of p for hydrogen be always 2 for balmer transition therefore this equation can be use to plot to give a straight line the rydberg constant and it uncertainty be calculate from there this phenomenon of why hydrogen only emit four line also know a the balmer line of hydrogen be explain by niels bohr in his model for the atom the electron which orbit the proton can only exist in certain orbital state a quantum number the diagram below show a visual representation of these transition the experiment be carry out in a dark room in the laboratory to allow clearer image to see through the spectrometer and reduce human error the method that be carry out in order to obtain all the data need be a follow  the first and most important part of the experiment be set up the spectrometer so that it be in focus  the camera lens be focus on a distant object so that the cross wire be on top of it  then the hydrogen lamp be place near the slit and the collimator focus be adjust until a sharp image be show  in order to ensure that the collimator be align at 0 degree with the camera the telescope be move through 90 degree and clamped  then the grate table be turn until a reflect image be see use a mirror in place of the diffraction grate  at this point the collimator and camera be at 45 degree from each other the telescope be rotate back through 45 degree and this give normal incidence to give the zeroth order measurement  for each colour the telescope be rotate in both direction to look for the 1 st 2 nd etc order emission line  the angle of each line be record  measurement for the error be also take the width of the line be measure for each line i.e the difference in the angle between the two side of the strip  this be the great source of uncertainty in this experiment and therefore it be the data use to plot the errorbars on the graph in the result  at first it be thought that the great source of error would be from partner record different angle however when this be compare with the other source of error it be found that the subjective reading be much less significant than the error due to not know where to position the cross hair on every line a note regard the procedure that be follow be that after take the measurement for the first colour the hydrogen lamp stop work so it be replace with another one it be attempt to place it in exactly the same position so that it would not cause the reading for different colour to be inconsistent below be graph of sin 𝜃 against m for each colour these be use to calculate the wavelength it can be see that they all follow straight line trend use python 's poly1fit function the equation for each line of best fit be obtain the uncertainty be include from here the graph to calculate the rydberg constant be plot the equation for this line be 2.088e+07 x 7.83e+0 the magnitude of the gradient of this graph 2.088e+07𝑚 −1 from earlier error calculation the uncertainty in this gradient be 1.087e+07𝑚 −1 from the above graph it be clear that one point be an anomaly and so it be not include in the calculation the reason it be so far off from the trendline be that the blue light measurement be take use one lamp whereas the other two be both do use the same lamp although use only 2 point reduces the validity of the experiment conclusion can still be make furthermore the wavelength obtain be of the same order of magnitude but they be low than their actual value this be due to a systematic error which in this experiment be human error in reading the angle from the spectrometer the official accepted value for the rydberg constant be 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 the value of 2.088e+07𝑚 −1 +/-1.087e+07𝑚 −1 be of the same order of magnitude a this furthermore the accepted value lie within the error range of the experimental value,superficial,none
10,GS_CYF541_Redacted,the principle purpose of the conduct experiment be to calculate rydberg constant `` r `` the value be found to be r 11123886.85 ± 1317838m -1 this be calculate by mean of a spectrometer where hydrogen light be normally incident on a diffraction grate thus separate the different color of hydrogen a telescope be then use to measure the diffraction angle correspond to several order and the wavelength of the associate color for the balmer series of hydrogen the balmer series governs the descent of electron from high energy level to the second energy level then the rydberg constant be calculate use the three wavelength of the hydrogen light red violet and blue finally the mean value of the three obtain rydberg constant be obtain and use a the value of the rydberg constant the calculate value of the rydberg constant along with it associate error be within the range of the actual value the difference between the two value can be mainly attribute to different random and instrumental error which be discus thoroughly in this report the main aim behind the conduct experiment be to determine `` rydberg `` constant use the spectrum of hydrogen rydberg constant be a fundamental atomic constant which appear in several relationship famously associate with the hydrogen atom and have unit of m -1 1 this be determine by study the diffraction pattern of hydrogen light use a spectrometer a spectrometer be an instrument use to study different phenomenon of light 2 see section iii historically isaac newton in 1666 be the first scientist who demonstrate that sunlight be constitute of several different color and coin the word `` spectrum `` after that several other scientist include melville and angstrom study the different spectral line of different type of light until rydberg in 1890 mathematically derive a formula which include this constant finally bohr show that it can be express in more fundamental term 3 see section ii in this experiment the rydberg constant be determine use the relation of associate with the balmer series the balmer series describes the transition of electron in the hydrogen atom from high energy state to state of n=2 where n be the quantum number the spectral line consider in this experiment be the line correspond to n=3 red wavelength n=4 blue wavelength and n=5 violet wavelength which be in the visible spectrum 4 it be important to note that the balmer series contains several spectral line which be in the ultraviolet region furthermore determine the different wavelength of the three spectral line be base on the phenomenon of diffraction whereby incident light from the source bend when it encounter a diffraction grate 5 the main phenomenon behind this experiment be diffraction of light diffraction of light a mention in the introduction section be the phenomenon where a beam of light be spread out when encounter an obstacle grate in this case by geometrically analyze the pattern obtain the follow relationship can be derive where d be the slit separation in meter θ be the angle between two beam of light in radian m be the order number and λ be the wavelength of the incident light in meter a mention in the introduction section the balmer series be use to obtain the rydberg constant it be express a follow where r ∞ be rydberg constant in m -1 and n and p be integer which represent energy level of initial and final state respectively the rydberg constant can be express in more fundamental constant a where ɑ be a constant me be the electron mass kg c be the speed of light in vacuum m/s and h be planck 's constant joule second furthermore the constant ɑ can be determine use the follow formula determination of the rydberg constant use the spectrum of hydrogen where ϵ 0 be the permittivity in free space farad per meter therefore use equation 1 the wavelength of the three spectral line red blue and violet be calculate by plot three fit of sin θ v the order m where the slope of these plot represent λ/d hence from equation 2 and note that the value of p in the balmer series be 2 rydberg constant be determine the first step in the experiment be to adequately align the spectrometer first the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire by view the image of a distant object the window of the building face the lab a sodium lamp be then use for the purpose of position the telescope so that it be align with the axis of the collimator after that the telescope be move 90 degree the vernier scale be use to measure the angle and a grate be place in the holder the table be turn until a reflect image be see which indicates that it be at an angle of 45 degree finally the grate be place so that the beam be at normal incidence and then the telescope be position back to face the grate the sodium lamp be replace by the hydrogen lamp to start obtain data in order to determine rydberg constant the diffraction pattern of the hydrogen light be observe the telescope be use to observe the different spectral line at different order negative and positive order the start position be the zeroth order which have all three spectral line red blue and violet overlap then for the red and blue spectral line the angle of the order from m=-4 to m=4 be measure by reading the vernier scale however for the violet spectral line we be only able to observe the order from m=-2 to m=2 it be also important to note that the error in the vernier scale be take to be ±0.5 arcminute after obtain the data a plot be create use python for three fit for the three different spectral line of sin θ v the order m from which the wavelength of the light be obtain from these three different wavelength three different value of the rydberg constant be obtain and the mean and error of the value be calculate use python a well 6 the experimental data obtain in this experiment be diffraction angle for the three different spectral line of hydrogen at different negative and positive order hence a graph of sin θ v the order m be obtain graph 1 the plot of the three spectral line of hydrogen red blue and violet of equation y 0.05164x -0.002256 y 0.03728x 0.007478 and y 0.03377x -0.00164 respectively the three plot show a linear straight line a expect from the relation represent in equation 1 from the slope of the three fit the wavelength of the spectral line be calculate a follow similarly λviolet 473 nm and λviolet 428 nm hence use the three value of the wavelength three value of the rydberg constant be obtain from equation 2 it be important to note that the value for n for the red blue and violet wavelength be 3 4 and 5 respectively 7 the value of the rydberg constant be rred 10986831.91m -1 rblue 11273247.5m -1 and rviolet 11111581.14m -1 thus the mean value of the rydberg constant be calculate to be r 11123886.85m -1 associate uncertainty calculate in the follow section use python the error in the slope of the three fit be estimate and hence the error in the wavelength be calculate then δλred 8.1 nm similarly δλblue 54.8 nm and δλviolet 4.29 nm where the symbol δ mean the error of correspondingly the error in the three rydberg constant be δrred 135867 1306076 and δrviolet 111375. thus the error in the mean rydberg constant be δr 111375 this be calculate use the formula of the standard deviation and the number n of the dataset therefore the value of the rydberg constant obtain be r 11123886.85 ± 1317838. the calculate value of the rydberg constant along with it error lie within the range of the accepted value which be r 10973731.6 m -1 this indicates that the value be relatively accurate but do not rule out the possibility of the existence of systematic error equation 1 indicates that y-intercept of such fit should be zero which do not agree with the result although the y-intercept be small this be also the result of the existence of several source of error there be several source of error in the conduct experiment which explain the difference between the calculate value and the actual one first of all error in measure the diffraction angle due to the instrumental error of the vernier scale which be estimate to be 1 arc minute furthermore parallax error be take into consideration due to the difficulty in reading such small value at different angle to reduce parallax error my lab partner and i try to separately do the reading from the same angle for all measurement several outer source of error be present include light from neighbor experiment this be mainly evident when observe the violet spectral line be upon turn off the light from neighbor experiment two more order become clearly observe concern systematic error some possible source of error include the calibration of the spectrometer in other word the position of the telescope or grate might not have be exactly a require which therefore would have affected all the obtain measurement additionally the eyepiece of the spectrometer be open in order to see large beam of light this in turn make it more difficult to see where exactly the spectral line be align with the cross wire moreover influence from external source light from outside might also have result in affect all the measurement finally possibly the major factor which explains the difference between the two value would be the number of data point obtain especially in the violet spectral line we be only able to obtain angle for 4 order from m=-2 to m=2 which would decrease the accuracy of the result it should be note that all the above uncertainty be take into consideration and express a error bar in graph 1 above the main aim of the conduct experiment be to calculate the value of rydberg constant the major result be therefore the r 11123886.85 ± 1317838 m -1 the calculate value of the along with it error lie within the range of the actual value of the rydberg constant the key success in the experiment be mainly be able to measure the diffraction angle the wavelength of the spectral line and thus the rydberg constant the main shortcoming be the rather large random error associate with the value of the rydberg constant this can be attribute to instrumental and random error related o the measurement take and possibly also to systematic error mainly due the calibration of the spectrometer there be several way to improve the result the main method to follow would be to obtain more data point this could be do by eliminate almost all possible source of light which would enable u to observe high order of diffraction both on the negative and positive side furthermore use a more advanced spectrometer which would show a clearer diffraction pattern would also result in show more order a more advanced spectrometer would also ensure that the spectral line would almost be exactly align on the cross wire which would increase the accuracy of the measure angle this experiment prove that by use the spectrometer to observe the diffraction of hydrogen light we be able to calculate to a relatively high degree of accuracy a fundamental constant in atomic physic,superficial,bal

use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant r∞ this experiment result in a value for the rydberg constant a 10860000 ± 31690 m -1 a oppose to the literature value of 10973731.568508 m -1 because it be expressible a a product of many of the fundamental constant of physic a a result many experiment have be devise and carry out to make it one of the most precisely know physical constant a this

wavelength of light get diffract be measure for a many order a they remain visible fro m this data the wavelength of the light present in the spectrum can be calculate which in turn can be use to obtain a value for the rydberg constant r∞ if a gas be electrically excite it emits radiation at a few specific well-defined wavelength the wavelength that be present depend on the energy level within the atom of the substance produce the spectrum this be because a an electron transition from a high energy level to a low one it loses energy by emit a photon the energy of the photon be equal to the difference in energy between the two level if only one atom be present then only one emission lin e would be visible at any one time however a there be a copious amount of hydrogen all the emission

rotate through 90° -so that it be then point pe1pendicular to the colli.i mtor a min-or be then place on the diffraction grate m mnt and rotate until the iimge of the slit be centre on the cross hair tue diffraction grate m mnt be then rotate through 45° so that the light from the colfumtor be now at nonml incidence to it tue miiror be replace on the stand by a diffraction grate the orientation of

however v.iith the blue light the thii-d order be miss upon the analysis it becarre clear that this be because the angle that it should have be diffract by be ve1y close to the angle obtain for the second order of the red lightv.iithin approxirmtely 0.1 ° therefore we could deduce that it have be 'drowned out by the red a the red light be by far the brighter of the two from eq 5 it becorres apparent that there be a linear relationship between the order and the sine of the diffraction angle llllhiplied by the slit separation of the diffraction grate therefore plot a graph of d sin 0

493 ± 3.61nm and 438 ± 1.97 nm respectively these value be all great than their literature value by a similar amount -5nm 7nm and 4nm this show that there be an error of a systematic nature that be affect our result there be many possible source of error in this experiment with two of the most influential be a misalignment of the spectrometer and the human error involve in reading the vernier scale other small source of error include the grate period and the fact that the refractive index of air be n't 1. calculate a value for the rydberg constant with the value of each wavelength in turn

-preliminary data `` red `` fit `` red `` data fig 7. graph result from first data run red emission line this be the preliminary data record use the newly developed in/out method a before there be clearly a strong correlation between the two variable the uncertainty for m 0 be due to the fact that two central emission line be visible a cyan and a red at the centre they merge but it be difficult to determine whether these emission line should be treat a one or a two slightly separate emission line for this point they be treat a one thus increase the emission line width and therefore the uncertainty in the measurement of θ. these data give a wavelength of 654.7 ± 0.2 nm and hence n 3. a value for the rydberg constant r∞ be calculate a 1.0997 ± 0.0004 × 10 7 m −1 the accepted value of r∞ do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty this new method have successfully reduce the uncertainty in the measurement however the value calculate for r∞ do not agree with the

give a wavelength of 484.6 ± 0.1 nm and hence n 4. a value for the rydberg constant r∞ be calculate a 1.1006 ± 0.0002 × 10 7 m −1 the accepted value of r∞ do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty line since hydrogen do not have an orange colour emission line this line be measure and a wavelength of 587.5 ± 0.3 nm be record the data for this line be outline in figure 10. the origin of this orange emission line be unknown perhaps it originate from some out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp due to the high temperature inside although this do seem very unlikely an experiment study the emission spectrum of nacl solution flame test have be carry out with the equipment before this data run have be carry out although this do not seem to have affected the equipment in any way two final value for the rydberg constant be calculate one for each run of the experiment but take the mean of both the calculate value and their uncertainty for the first run of the experiment a final value of 1.111 ± 0.006 × 10 7 m −1 be calculate and can be see plot in figure 11 a `` average run 1 `` for the second run of the experiment a final value of 1.1004±0.0004 ×10 7 m −1 be calculate and can also be see plot in figure 11 a `` average run 2 `` a can be see in figure 11 the accepted value for r ∞ do not fall within any of the range define by the calculate value and their respective uncertainty however the data collect from each run be clearly quite different run 2 -orange -definitive data `` orange `` fit `` orange `` data fig 10. graph result from first data run orange emission line this be the definitive data record use the newly developed in/out method interestingly an orange emission line be observe in the hydrogen emission spectrum there do not exist an orange emission line hence this be measure in order to record a wavelength such that this emission line could later be look up this emission line be the brightest and clearest of the three observe during the definitive data run these data give a wavelength of 587.5 ± 0.3 nm from a previous experiment in which the emission line of sodium be measure a 587.7 ± 0.4 nm use a sodium vapour lamp and 587.6 ± 0.4 nm use a nacl flame test -both of these measurement use the in/out method this emission line be clearly identify a sodium j. sansonetti give this emission line of sodium a 588.9950954 ± 0.0000015 nm 5 data from the first run be less precise and also less accurate than data from the second run furthermore the uncertainty for the measurement take in the first run be clearly large in magnitude than the uncertainty for the measurement take in the second run the reason for this be unknown however it be hypothesise that the stark difference in each data set 's accuracy be due to the alignment of the spectrometer before the data be collect during the alignment process for the first run of the experiment explain in section iii when the grate be turn by precisely 45 • such that it be meant to be at 90 • to the centre line it be clearly not this perplexed u and the alignment process be attempt again upon repeat the alignment process the grate be still not perfectly align however we attempt to continue with the experiment for the second run the same issue occur again however this time the effect be much less pronounce although the grate do not seem to be at exactly 90 • to the centre line of the collimator the hypothesis be the data from the first run be less accurate more spread out because the spectrometer be more misalign whereas the data from the second run be more accurate less spread out because the spectrometer be less misalign in this experiment the rydberg constant for hydrogen be calculate a 1.1004 ± 0.0004 × 10 7 m −1 use angle measurement take with a grate spectrometer a hydrogen vapour lamp be use a the light source in order to observe fig 11. all of the calculate value for the rydberg constant value from run 1 have a large spread than those from run 2. also the value from run 1 have much wider uncertainty than from run 2 run 2 use the in/out method whereas run 1 do not average mean be take of the calculate value for run 1 run 2 and for all of the value these value be also plot alongside the individual emission line calculation for reference the accepted value for r∞ have be plot 1.09737316 × 10 7 m −1 1 the accepted value for r∞ do not lie within any of the range define by the calculate value uncertainty the emission spectrum of hydrogen use the equipment the experiment be run twice since a novel method for determine the centre of the emission line observe be developed after the first run of the experiment be complete the data from the first run be much less accurate and precise than those of the second run and this be clearly visible in figure 11. hence a the mean of the second data run be much more precise and accurate than that of the first this be select a the final value for the rydberg constant a calculate in this experiment unusually during data collection for the second repeat of the experiment an orange emission line be observe in the emission spectrum of hydrogen there do not exist an orange colour emission line the wavelength of this emission line be measure a 587.5 ± 0.3 nm confirm it a originate from sodium in a previous experiment use the same equipment the wavelength of the emission line from a sodium vapour lamp be record a 587.7 ± 0.4 nm and the wavelength of the emission line from a flame test of a nacl solution be record a 587.6 ± 0.4 nm the origin of this emission line be unknown a possible explanation could be out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp although this do seem to be an unlikely scenario for this experiment a visual grate spectrometer be use to make the measurement other spectrometer design exist such a a computer-aided grate spectrometer in which the eyepiece be replace with a detector array usually a ccd or cmos sensor the benefit of use a computer-aided spectrometer over a visual grate spectrometer have already be investigate 6 in this investigation it be found that there be no significant improvement or reduction in the uncertainty of the measurement when use a computer-aided spectrometer thus this experiment would not be improve through this suggestion however if the experiment be to be repeat again much more care should be take in align the spectrometer when carry out this experiment the spectrometer do not appear perfectly align before the first data set be record before the second data set be record the spectrometer be align much more carefully however the alignment be still not perfect it be hypothesise that the misalignment of the spectrometer explains the difference in accuracy between the two separate run of the experiment in order to far reduce the error in measure the angle of the maximum in the spectrum a diffraction grate with a high number of lines/mm could have be use such that the angle separate the order of the spectrum would be large thus the uncertainty in determine the small change in the angle on the vernier scale would have be far reduce combine with the `` in/out `` method of measurement developed the uncertainty could be reduce to an even well range more repetition of the experiment could improve the final mean value take for r ∞ a long a the spectrometer be correctly align when carry out the experiment it be important to make detailed note on the alignment procedure so that during data analysis it be possible to notice any issue that may have arisen,superficial,none
13,GS_LZH215_Redacted,abstract-the main aim of this experiment be to determine the value of the rydberg constant this be do by find the wavelength of the spectral line associate with the balmer series in a hydrogen atom this be found by use the principle of diffraction the spectral line be diffract through a diffraction grate in a grate spectrometer then by know the energy level transition associate with these spectral line and by use the rydberg formula for hydrogen atom the rydberg constant be calculate our measure value for the rydberg constant be 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value give a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 1 due to the small percentage error but an uncertainty which do n't include the accepted value with slight improvement this method can produce accurate and precise measurement for the rydberg constant however in it current state the procedure give result which do n't agree with the accepted value the main reason for this inaccuracy be that it be difficult to read the scale on the grate spectrometer a it be too small this be not help by the fact that we have to constantly squint our eye to try to read the value from the scale with only a very bright desk lamp over the scale if a digital grate spectrometer be use then the measurement would be much more accurate he bohr model of the atom describes negatively charge electron in orbit of a positively charge central nucleus at particular radius at these radius the electron only have discrete value of energy call energy level the electron can remain indefinitely in the energy level without emit radiation and lose energy if the electron be give the correct amount of energy they can jump to a high energy level if this occurs the electron be say to be excite energy can be transfer to the electron be several way include absorb a photon of electromagnetic radiation which have energy exactly equal to the difference between the two energy level if enough energy be give to the electron it will escape the electrostatic force of attraction of the positively charge nucleus and the atom will be ionise the rydberg constant be the wavenumber inverse wavelength of the photon of the low energy which will cause the ionisation of a hydrogen atom it be first use by swedish physicist johannes rydberg in 1890. it be one of the most accurately measure fundamental physical constant with accepted measure value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 ± 5.9x10 -10 1 however it can be express a a combination of other physical constant where me be the mass of an electron e be the charge of an electron h be plank constant c be the speed of light and ε0 be the permittivity of free space due to the number of fundamental physical constant which define the rydberg constant it be very important and powerful constant in particular it can be use to find the energy level within any atom of a know element this experiment will find a value for the rydberg constant by find the wavelength of spectral line use the principle of diffraction in the hydrogen vapour lamp be use a large potential difference be put across the hydrogen vapour this cause electron from the cathode at one end of the vapour tube to travel across it to the anode at the other end of the tube these electron collide with the electron in the hydrogen atom transfer energy to them this cause the electron in the hydrogen atom to gain more energy and thus move into a high energy level become excite the excite electron will eventually jump back to the ground state the low energy level this be call deexcitation the electron can jump to a low energy level by release a photon of electromagnetic radiation with energy equivalent to the difference between the energy level same energy of photon that would be require to excite the electron between the two energy level an excite electron can deexcite directly to the ground state or indirectly by descend to low energy level first this mean that lesser energy photon can be release by the de-excitation the energy of a photon e be dependent on it frequency f and be give by the relationship 𝐸 ℎ𝑓 2 where h be plank constant and have a value of 6.626070040 × 10 −34 j thus a electron de-excite many different wavelength of photon be produce which correspond to the different energy level transition measure the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer t for a hydrogen atom which have only one electron it have be observe that for all the transition to the second energy level the correspond photon for each transition have a wavelength in the visible light spectrum it can thus be observe these photon be call the balmer series this can be observe in the energy level diagram below in figure 1. if these photon in be refract through a prism an emission spectrum will be produce a show in figure 2 below each line of the spectrum be call a spectral line each line corresponds to different frequency of photon which be release in de-excitation and be in the visible light frequency range emission spectrum can also be produce with diffraction grate a diffraction grate be a plate with multiple parallel slit on it in grate spectrometer the photon release from the hydrogen lamp be direct into the spectrometer where they pa through the diffraction grate the photon passing through adjacent slit interact with each other cause constructive inference in some place and destructive interference in others produce a pattern see in figure 3 below the central beam be refer to a the zeroth order and be in the same direction a the incident ray the order increase with increase angle from the central beam the relationship between the order and the angle of it diffraction be sin 𝜃 𝑁𝜆𝑚 3 where θ be the angle of diffraction of the order angle of order relative to central beam n be the number of slit per metre on the diffraction grate λ be the wavelength of the photon and m be the order of the beam if a graph of sin θ against order m be plot the wavelength of the spectral line can be found by divide the gradient of the by the number of slit per metre in the diffraction grate n the graph produce should be a straight line with a positive gradient the rydberg constant 𝑅 can be calculate use the wavelength of the spectral line and the rydberg formula show below where λ be the wavelength of the photon emit n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level of the electron a we be measure balmer series spectral line the final energy level be always the second energy level so the formula can be manipulate to in this experiment we be use the red and blue spectral line a they be most prominent thus by look at figure 1 and figure 2 on the left we can see the red spectral line be due to the transition from 3 rd to the 2 nd energy level this be because the red spectral line have the high frequency low energy of all the visible spectral line produce thus we can also see the blue spectral line be due to the electron transition from the 4 th to the 2 nd energy level this be because the blue spectral line have the second high frequency second low energy of all the visible spectral line produce thus we set up the grate spectrometer a show in the lab manual except a sodium lamp be use to calibrate it and the main scale be in 0.5º in do so we ensure that the crosshair be rotate to the `` x `` positon the telescope be in focus with the image of the spectral line and the diffraction grate be perpendicular to the incident source this be show in figure 4 of the experimental setup we then place the hydrogen lamp in front of the slit on the grate spectrometer i look through the eye piece lens on the grate spectrometer and found the zeroth spectral line this be identify a the brightest spectral line which be about 180º with the lamp and have all the different wavelength spectral line overlap we record the angle of the zeroth order spectral line by turn the eyepiece lens such that the cross hair be in the middle of the spectral line this measurement be use a a reference measurement ø0 i then measure the angle ø of the red spectral line from order -4 to 4. be the positive order be those anticlockwise of the zeroth order and the negative order be clockwise of the zeroth order a show in the figure 5. this be then repeat by my lab partner and an average angle for each order be calculate we then calculate the relative angle of the spectral line to the zeroth order θ by subtract the angle of the zeroth order spectral line from the average angle of each order we then plot a graph of sin θ against the order for the red spectral line and measure the gradient of the best line of fit we then divide the gradient by the grate space to obtain the wavelength of the spectral line this be then repeat for the blue spectral line the value for the wavelength of the red spectral line be inputted into equation 6 to find a value of the rydberg constant the value for the wavelength of the blue spectral line be inputted into equation 7 to find another value of the rydberg constant these value be average to produce an average value for the rydberg constant from this method this be compare to the accepted value the graph produce from the red spectral line be show below in figure 6. this graph show a positive correlation between sin θ and the order of the beam the graph have a gradient of 0.0532 ± 0.0013. when this be multiply by the grate space 78.8 line per mm it be found the wavelength of the red spectral line be 6.756x10 -7 ± 1.68x10 -8 m. when this be inputted into equation 6 below it be found that the rydberg constant be 10657641.3 ± 265669.6 m -1 the graph produce from the blue spectral line be show this graph show a positive correlation between sin θ and the order of the beam the graph have a gradient of 0.0385 ± 0.0002. when this be multiply by the grate space 78.8 line per mm it be found the wavelength of the blue spectral line be 4.890x10 -7 ± 3.0x10 -9 m. when this be inputted into equation 7 below it be found that the rydberg constant be 10906793.3 ± 67911.9 m -1 when these value where average our measure value for the rydberg constant be 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value give a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 a we can see from both these graph the uncertainty in sin θ be small a the uncertainty in the measurement of θ be 2 3 ° this meant the uncertainty in sin θ be give by the expression the small uncertainty in sin θ lead to a small uncertainty in the wavelength of the spectral line λ give by the expression thus the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for each wavelength be give by the expression where n be the initial energy level thus the uncertainty in the average value of the rydberg constant be even though the uncertainty seem large it be relativity small when compare to the magnitude of the rydberg constant moreover our measure value have a small percentage error of 1.745 however our uncertainty do include the accepted value thus our measure value disagrees with the accepted value the aim of this experiment be to determine the rydberg constant this be do by find the wavelength of the spectral line associate with the balmer series we found this by the principle of diffraction a different wavelength of photon will diffract through a diffraction grate by different angle from this we measure the rydberg constant a 10782217.13 ± 137106.1 m -1 this value give a percentage error of 1.745 from the accepted value of 10973731.56850865 m -1 due to the small percentage error but an uncertainty which do n't include the accepted value with slight improvement this method can produce accurate and precise measurement for the rydberg constant however in it current state the procedure give result which do n't agree with the accepted value the main reason for this inaccuracy be that it be difficult to read the scale on the grate spectrometer a it be too small this be not help by the fact that we have to constantly squint our eye to try to read the value of the scale with only a very bright desk lamp over the scale if a digital grate spectrometer be use then the measurement would be much more accurate furthermore it be difficult to place the crosshair in the centre of the spectral line when it be rotate to the `` x `` position i feel it might have be easy to place the crosshair in the centre if it be rotate to the `` `` position this adjustment would try and use the vertical line of the `` `` to bisect the spectral line by move the telescope when the spectral line be bisect the crosshair would be in the middle of the spectral line moreover this inaccuracy could be due to the fact the hydrogen vapour lamp continued to overheat which cause the spectral line to slowly fade a the intensity of the spectral line decrease it become more difficult to see through the telescope and thus more difficult to take accurate reading this problem could be eliminate by use hydrogen vapour lamp with well cool we also consider the width of the spectral line a possible uncertainty however when we attempt to measure the width it be too small to measure with the scale on the grate spectrometer due to the fact the grate spectrometer be a very precise measure device the width of the spectral line be consider a negligible if a wider slit be use the spectral line would have be wider and thus the width may not have be negligible however this would have cause the sharpness and contrast of the line to be lose meaning it would have be more difficult to take accurate reading 1 http //ws680 nist.gov/publication/get pdf.cfm pub id=9206 87 2 http

14,GS_SZB587_Redacted,"we have use diffraction grate spectrometry to measure the wavelength of the spectral line of hydrogen and determine the rydberg constant we have found the spectral line to correspond to the balmer series with wavelength of 660±10 nm for the red light and 490± 6 nm for the green light we calculate the rydberg constant heavy nucleus in air which we found to be 1090 ± 10 × 10 4 m −1 our measurement be 0.637 off the currently accepted value of 10973731.56859 10 ±9 × 10 −10 m −1 for the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 off the calculate value of 10960797 ± 10 m −1 for the rydberg constant in air both accepted value be within our range of uncertainty t he rydberg constant relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of an atom during electron transition to the the number denote the energy level between which the electron transition rydberg measure this constant to be 107,921.6 cm -1 1 the rydberg be first measure experimentally by janne rydberg a a constant common to each spectral series for the hydrogen atom 1 however this constant also arises a a consequence of a fundamental quantum mechanical effect namely the quantisation of energy level of the atom by apply the quantum mechanical atomic model to the hydrogen atom and quantise it electron energy level niels bohr be able to derive the rydberg constant theoretically 2 therefore the calculation of the rydberg constant be not only of importance to spectrometry but to the verification of the quantum mechanical model of the atom propose by bohr contrary to rydberg 's initial assumption the actual value of the rydberg constant varies between element depend on the mass of their nucleus 1 however for element whose nucleus be much heavier than an electron the rydberg factor r ∞ be approximately constant the rydberg constant for heavy atom have be measure experimentally to a high accuracy to be r ∞ 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 -10 m -1 3 in this experiment we aim to measure the rydberg constant use diffraction grate spectrometry we will examine the spectral emission line of hydrogen through a grate spectrometer and consequently determine the wavelength of the emission line this will allow u to calculate a value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each wavelength we will then calculate a mean measurement of r h and use it to calculate r ∞ we compare our measure value to curently accepted value of the rydberg constant a well a discus the condition affect the constant such a the permittivity of free space the main apparatus use in this experiment be a grate spectrometer a hydrogen lamp be use to excite hydrogen atom in order to radiate light the grate spectrometer collimates light come from the source through the collimator and directs it through a diffraction grate each wavelength of light diffracts at a different angle thus we achieve a separation of the spectral line of hydrogen emission the angle at which the light ray be diffract be a periodic function of the wavelength a show in fig 2. the difference between the path of the light ray diffract at two adjacent slit distance d apart to the same point on a plane l away from the grate be then from fig 1 equal to r 1 − r 2 thus if the angle between the line connect the midpoint between the slit and the point on the plane of incidence be θ then if the slit separation d be small enough compare to separation of the plane l then r 2 r 1 be approximately true now a r 1 r 2 the path difference be therefore dsin θ assume d l and slit width d then θ θ which be the angular displacement between the consecutive order if the two light ray be to interfere constructively the path difference between them must be an integer multiple of the wavelength therefore where m be the order of maximum intensity and λ be the wavelength plot sine of the angular displace for each order against the order number we obtain a straight line whose gradient be λ/d and a we know the separation d we can calculate the value of λ for each spectral line the rydberg constant be an empirical constant calculate upon analyse the spectral line series of an element such a the balmer series for hydrogen emission spectrum 5 these series take the form where λ be the wavelength of radiation r ∞ be the rydberg constant for heavy element and n f and n i be integer characterise the spectral line and the series respectively 6 however the rydberg constant also arises when bohr 's quantum mechanical theory of the atom 1 be apply to the hydrogen atom 2 bohr 's derivation be base upon planck 's theory of the quantisation of radiation from an atom which state that atom only radiate energy which be integer multiple of a fundamental quantity this may be mathematically write a follow where e be the radiation energy ν be it 's frequency h be planck 's constant and n be an integer multiple 8 9 bohr 's model proposes that electron can exist in stable quantise circular 2 orbit around the atom without radiate energy where the centripetal force be provide by the coulomb attraction force therefore if an electron transition from a high energy n th i orbit to a low energy n th f orbit then by consider the energy of each orbit a the sum of the potential and kinetic energy of the electron the difference in energy between the orbit ∆e be then give by 3 where m e be the electron mass e be the electron charge 0 be the permittivity of free space and h be planck 's constant 10 a the difference in energy be equal to the frequency of radiation multiply by planck 's constant 8 where c be the speed of light in a vacuum and λ be the wavelength of radiation finally we get where with r ∞ be the rydberg constant for large nucleus a the ratio of the mass of the electron to the proton be too large compare to the accuracy of the measurement of the rydberg constant the ratio be approximately m p /m e 1836 11 the mass of the proton must be take into account when find the rydberg constant for hydrogen this be in order to account for the motion of the nucleus however all that be need to account for the difference be to replace the term m e with µ where µ be the reduce mass for the protonelectron system 12 where with m n be the mass of the proton or the nucleus thus our calculate value of rydberg constant becomes r h denotes the rydberg 's constant for the hydrogen atom which be in fact the value of rydberg constant we will measure from the gradient of the graph of our experiment to obtain the value of r ∞ we use the follow equation this experiment be perform use a spectrometer and hydrogen lamp light from the hydrogen lamp be pas through a light collimator which directs the light ray through the diffraction grate and into a telescope the spectrometer 's telescope be focus use an object 5 meter away to ensure sharpness of image a sodium lamp be use to align the collimator and telescope with the slit use the telescope 's cross-hair the width of the slit be chosen a a compromise between light intensity and sharpness of image the diffraction grate be then adjust to be perpendicular to the path of light between the collimator and telescope this be do by turn the telescope by exactly 90 degree from original alignment position with a mirror instead of the diffraction grate in place the mirror be then adjust until it be at exactly 45 degree to the telescope with the image from the mirror exactly at the centre of the cross-hair the mirror be then turn by 45 degree opposite to ensure it 's perpendicular to original align line of sight the mirror be then replace with the grate and telescope be turn back to original position the orientation of the grate in the vertical plane be also adjust by adjust the height and orientation of the grate stage so that the light ray pas exactly through the centre of the grate and appear in the centre of the telescope lens this be test by check that the image do not tilt or move up or down a the telescope be rotate the adjustment be do in order to prevent the diffract light ray from deviate vertically away from the plane of the telescope lens a well a tilt of the image which would increase uncertainty in it position another reason for ensure alignment be to prevent the light ray from hit the telescope at an angle to the horizontal plane which would reduce the accuracy of our approximate model in equation 2 a number of diffraction grate with different number of slit per millimetre be try to find the optimal grate to use for our experiment for each grate the angle between the first two maximum be measure a displayed in table 1. we settle on the 300 slit per millimetre grate a a compromise between have a suitable number of maximum per degree turn while each degree turn be itself large enough in order to reduce the uncertainty a well a have large enough resolve power for each spectral line the telescope be turn in both direction to measure the angle between the initial position and the maximum of each order a show in fig 2. for each maximum the angular width of the image appear in the telescope be measure twice by my lab partner and myself and the average width calculate to determine the uncertainty in our angular measurement for each wavelength we only take 5 measurement a beyond that the light be too dim to take any more accurate measurement of the angular displacement iv result 1 wavelength of spectral line a we plot sine of the angular displacement against the order the gradient of the graph be the wavelength λ divide by the slit width d. from fig 3 the gradient of the green line 0.148 ± 0.002 dimensionless the gradient of the red line 0.197 ± 0.003 dimensionless for each line the relationship between the gradient g and the wavelength follow the equation the width of each slit in the grate be 1/300 mm 3.33×10 −3 ± 1×10 −5 mm consequently the wavelength of the red light similarly the green light 's wavelength λ green be the uncertainty in each value of sin θ in term of θ where θ be the angular displacement be give by σ where with σ θ be the angular width of each maximum in our measurement for each colour σ θ be approximately constant for the red light σ θ 4 arc minute a measure by my lab partner and myself while for the green light σ θ 7 and 5 arc minute with a mean value of 6 arc minute this be all take into account when compute the error on the gradient 2 arc minute be also add in order to account for uncertainty in angle measurement on both edge of the image assume the error in the slit width and the error on the angular width of each maximum be linearly independent then the error on the wavelength σ λ be therefore give in term of the uncertainty in the gradient and in slit width σ g and σ d respectively through 2 rydberg constant calculation the wavelength of the light ray observe correspond more closely to the balmer series than to any other series 5 therefore n f to equal 2 while n i be 3 for red and 4 for green in equation 3 for the rydberg constant for red light n i 3 and n f 2. the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h be give by 4 use equation 3 the weight mean for r h be thus a discus in the theoretical section to find the rydberg constant for heavy nucleus r ∞ we use equation 11 with m e be the electron mass and m p be the proton mass the ratio m p /m e be experimentally measure to be 1836.152470 76 11 thus our calculate value of r ∞ be with a range of therefore our value of the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom and the rydberg constant for heavy element be indistinguishable due to the high uncertainty associate with each value the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 −10 m −1 which fall within our uncertainty range this mean our measure value have a mean percentage error of 0.638 4 all uncertainty calculation be include in the appendix our measure range of value for the rydberg constant agrees experimentally with the currently accepted value a it fall within our range however a number of random and systematic error that our uncertainty on the value be discus below the rydberg constant be a function of the permittivity of free space a discus in the theory section the permittivity of free space itself varies with pressure and humidity 13 therefore the permittivity of free space in our laboratory be different to the permittivity of free space in a vacuum upon which the accepted value of the rydberg constant be base the ratio of absolute permittivity of air to permittivity of a vacuum also know a relative permittivity be currently measure to be 1.00058986 ± 0.00000050 14 this mean that r ∞ in air at standard pressure and temperature be 5 this value be still within our range of expect value of r ∞ however the mean percentage error be reduce from 0.638 to 0.547 another major source of systematic uncertainty be background light presence of background light would cause the width of the observe image to be small a the eye becomes less sensitive to light this would force u to use a large slit width in order to increase brightness of image which would produce a less sharp image with large uncertainty in position it also meant that we could obtain few data point a the image become much dimmer for maximum of order high than 3 and less than -2. this assymetry in the data in itself suggests that background light from one direction be conceal the maximum at the order of -3. it also meant that we could not make any accurate measurement of the blue spectral line with n f =5 one blue spectral be observe at an angle of about -8 degree however the line be too dim to make any accurate measurement regard it position or to find any other blue spectral line theoretically the telescope have to be focus at infinity however we could only use a 5-metre-away object for focus due to the dimension and capacity of the laboratory room this meant that the telescope may have not be perfectly focus and a defocus aberration along the optical axis of the telescope might have occur this would mean that the image be stretch out with a large uncertainty in position while all care have be take to ensure the alignment of the spectrometer a discus in the method section small deviation from alignment would lead to light fall at a vertical angle to the telescopic lens from fig 1 the path of light would be shift vertically i.e out of the paper in the figure this mean light would travel a distance r 2 or r 1 plus some vertical distance k. the path difference δ thus becomes if k=0 this simply reduces to dsin θ for k not equal to zero the path difference approximation a dsin θ becomes less accurate if k or the vertical misalignment be comparable to the separation of the slit and the telescope the uncertainty due to this add approximate becomes significantly large our experiment be aim at measure the rydberg constant by analyse the balmer series for hydrogen use a diffraction grate spectrometer we measure the wavelength of two of the spectral colour of the series the wavelength of the red colour be measure to be 660 ± 10 nm while the wavelength of the green colour be measure to be 490 ± 6nm these value be use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom which we found to be 1090 ± 10 × 10 4 m −1 we then use bohr 's atomic model formula for rydberg 's constant and found that the difference between the rydberg constant for hydrogen and that for heavy element be small than we could detect due to the size of our uncertainty in measurement in angular displacement the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ± 9×10 −10 m −1 in a vacuum and 10960797 ± 11 m −1 in air thus imply a mean percentage error of 0.638 on our measurement compare to the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 compare to the rydberg constant in air we have also calculate the rydberg constant in air at standard temperature and pressure use value for rydberg constant and relative permittivity from literature 14 at 10960797 ±11m −1 both of these value fall within our range of uncertainty for the rydberg constant if the experiment be to be repeat the most significant improvement to be make be improve isolation from background light such a run the experiment in a dark room with no external light or cover the collimator cover the collimator with a dark cloth would prevent external light from appear with the image reduce background light would allow for the gathering of the blue spectral line data this data could then be use to determine another value for the rydberg constant and hence improve the accuracy of the mean value it would also allow for the gathering of more data point for high order which would lead to reduce uncertainty due to random error another improvement would be the use of a diffraction grate with a wider slit a it would create more maximum per angular displacement and more data point can be gather this would reduce the effect of random error however it would also reduce the resolve power of the grate and thus introduce another uncertainty in the position of the maximum a grate with 150 slit per mm could thus be a well compromise between resolve power and number of data point over the 300 slit per mm grate we use use the same type of diffraction grate spectrometry analyse the spectral line of various element could be use to verify the relationship between r ∞ and the mass of the nucleus in order to verify bohr 's atomic model 's accuracy a state in equation 8 the uncertainty on the wavelength be give by thus for red light the uncertainty be similarly the uncertainty in the green light 's wavelength be the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h a calculate use the red light 's wavelength be give by σ r where 2 the uncertainty on the weight mean for the rydberg constant for hydrogen σ r h be give by the sum of the inverse of the error square which bohr 's model assumes that electron rotate around the hydrogen nucleus in fix quantise orbit the electron do not radiate any energy less than the difference between the energy level they 're occupy and any other energy level a the electron be rotate in almost circular orbit the centripetal force f centripetal be supply by the coulomb attraction force and give by 12 where 0 be the permittivity of free space e be the charge of the electron or the proton and r be the radius of the orbit we then have where m e be the electron mass and v it 's velocity a the orbit be quantise the angular momentum l n of the n th orbit be therefore also quantise this mean that for each orbit the angular momentum be an integral multiple of the reduce planck constant h. therefore we have where r n be the radius of the orbit and v n be the velocity of the electron in the orbit 12 solve equation 35 and 36 for r n and v n we get and we can now use these expression to work out the total energye total the energy of the orbit be give in term of kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p by 12 which be this reduces to a n be an integral value characterise each orbit if the electron start at orbit with n n i and end on orbit with n= n f the difference in energy be then give by ∆e where the rydberg constant be give by 2 let r ∞ air be the rydberg constant in air while r ∞ be the rydberg constant in a vacuum while air be the permittivity of free space in air while 0 be the permittivity of free space in a vacuum from equation 44 the ratio of the permittivity of free space in air to that in a vacuum be know a the relative

separation d of the grate and the wavelength of the light a diffraction grate can split polychromatic light into it component colour this be very similar to the double slit experiment the main difference be the small slit separation of grate the major cause of the phenomenon of grate be diffraction the slight bending of light a it pas around the edge of an object the amount of bending depends on the wavelength λ of light and the slit separation d. if the separation be much large than wavelength the bending will be unnoticeable whereas if the wavelength be close in size or equal with the grate space there be considerable amount of bending which can be observe easily figure 1 a beam of white light be separate by the grate 2 the grate can be consider a many small slit with

photon emit when electron transition between those level the rydberg constant be a proportionality constant between these variable 2 it be important that an accurate value of this constant be measure so that physicist can calculate the wavelength of photon emit when electron transition within an atom know the number of energy level they move through in the experiment light from a hydrogen lamp be shone through a 300 line per mm diffraction grate and the spectrometer be use to find different emission line the angle of the emission line relative to the zero-order fringe be then measure allow the wavelength of the light to be calculate the rydberg constant can then be determine from the rydberg equation a diffraction grate consists of a series of equally space parallel narrow slit when white light be shone through the grate it diffracts through each slit and interferes with light diffract through other slit the result be a series of alternate bright and dark fringe with each bright fringe except for the central fringe form a spectrum of visible light a each frequency of light diffracts at different angle the angle of each bright fringe to the normal be define by where m be the order of

level electron transition from the third energy level or high down to the second energy level emit photon with energy equal to the energy change in the transition 2 this mean electron at different

iii method the equipment be set up a in figure 1. before the experiment be undertaken the spectrometer be set up so that clear focus image could be see to reduce eye strain the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire the camera lens be then focus on an determination of the rydberg constant i object position 5-10 m away until no parallax be see between the cross wire and the object the telescope be subsequently align with the collimator and the hydrogen lamp be turn on i position the hydrogen lamp ~1cm from the slit so that the image would be bright then look through the telescope i change the focus of the collimator until a sharp image of the slit be see centre at the crosswire finally the slit width be decrease to ensure a great diffraction of light so that a sharper emission line would

separation of 3.33×10 -6 m be place in the holder the grate with the small slit separation be chosen to produce large diffraction angle which would make the emission line easy to differentiate from

myself both measure the angle and set the average of our reading a the 0 point this be to reduce the error in the reading and to give u a valid method of calculate the error we then repeat this method of measurement for the emission line and use the difference between the angle of the emission line and the angle of the incident beam a the diffraction angle in total 3 colour be visible-red green and

by the slit separation λ be determine this can then be use in equation 2 to get a value of the rydberg constant 3 therefore 3 value of the rydberg constant be obtained-1 for each colour an average value be calculate from the 3 value to reduce the error on the result i identify 3 major source of systematic error in the experiment there would clearly be uncertainty due to the resolution of the vernier scale ᵒ due to the fact there be uncertainty in the 0 position and the final measure value there would also be some uncertainty due to the thickness of the emission line which we measure to be ᵒ however because this be small than the resolution error it will not factor into the analysis finally error would be create through the difficulty in see the emission lines-this effect be bad for the

calculate gradient of 0.19921648 and 0.1325 respectively however the software be unable to produce error for these gradient a i only manage to obtain 2 result each for these colour meaning a covariance matrix could not be form to calculate the error i plot the steepest and shallowest possible line of best fit passing through all the error bar on figure 3 and 4. i then determine the error a where g be the steepest possible line of best fit gradient and g be the shallowest possible line of best fit gradient use equation 6 i obtain an error of ±0.054 for red and ±0.045 for purple the error in the wavelength can then be calculate use where σλ be the error in the wavelength and σ gradient be the error in the gradient the error in the rydberg constant for each colour can then be

and green light respectively the final result i obtain be r ∞ 1.069±0.151 ×10 7 m -1 the theoretical value be 1.097×10 7 m -1 1 which be within the uncertainty range of the measure value suggest the measure value be accurate however the error on it be very large it be evident that this large error be cause by the large error in the gradient of the red and purple light which be cause by the method of error analysis i use for these colour this would also explain why the error for the red and purple light be so much large than the green light despite the error bar on figure 2,3 and 4 look relatively consistent-although a large error would be expect a there be few result for red and purple this lack of result be cause by the hydrogen lamp overheat and dim after we measure the green line meaning by the time we measure the red and purple emission line only the 1 st order fringe be visible this could have be prevent by measure all the 1 st order fringe together and all the 2 nd order fringe together ideally the experiment could have also go on for longer which would have allow time for the hydrogen lamp to cool and be reuse to measure the 2 nd order fringe for the red and purple emission line another problem with the experiment be the light generate by other group lamp which make the emission line harder to see the error generate by this will be account for in equation 3 this could be correct by repeat the experiment with no other group present the large source of error be likely to come from the difficulty in see the emission line and possible parallax in measure the vernier scale this be highlight by the fact the error calculate from equation 3 be mostly large than the resolution error for each data set the aim of the experiment be to calculate a value for the rydberg constant this be do by use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer to measure the diffraction angle of hydrogen balmer line this allow λ to be calculate and subsequently a value for the rydberg constant to be obtain the average value of the rydberg constant i produce be r ∞ 1.069±0.151 ×10 7 m -1 the theoretical value of 1.097×10 7 m -1 be within the uncertainty range of the average measure value this suggests the result be accurate which will be because of the high-resolution vernier scale use a well a the procedure take to ensure a focus sharp image be produce such a place the hydrogen lamp ~1cm from the slit which be narrow a much a possible however the value have a large associate error which will be primarily due to the fact the hydrogen lamp be dim and overheat when the purple and red line measurement be make this meant only the 1 st order fringe of each be visible meaning a different method of error analysis be need for the red and purple light which yield large error to improve the experiment it could be repeat in a completely dark room with no other group and with enough time to obtain more result for red and purple light",extended,bal

experiment be that a diffraction grate allows more light to pa through and the maximum occur when they be all constructively interfere meaning the maximum be much brighter a see in figure 2. the phase difference between neighbour ray be give by the fraction of the wavelength displace multiply by 2π where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the light ray since the phase difference be an integer multiple m of 2π we can write the above equation a from the inset in figure 1 the path difference can be write a 𝑑 sin 𝜃 where d be the distance between neighbour slit and 𝜃 be the angle move through from the axis of the collimator therefore the equation becomes mλ 𝑑 sin 𝜃. to find the wavelength a graph of sin 𝜃 against m can be plot and the value of the gradient will be λ the wavelength can be found by multiply the gradient by the slit separation how the wavelength relates to the rydberg constant will be outline in theory section ii transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by the formula where n represent the initial energy state of the atom p represent the final energy state of the atom and 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant for this experiment the balmer series will be use because it be in the visible part of the spectrum and can measure the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer t be observe use a spectrometer in this series p=2 which mean that the will drop down from the n th to the second energy level and the difference in energy will give off a photon of a specific wavelength the value of n can be determine by look at the measure value of the wavelength this be due to the planck-einstein relation which state that 𝐸 ℎ𝑓 or 𝐸 ℎ 𝑐 𝜆 where e be the difference in energy h be planck 's constant f be the frequency and c be the speed of light in a vacuum from this we can see that the difference in energy be inversely proportional to the wavelength and therefore the small difference in energy from n=3 to p=2 will correspond to the big wavelength use the measure value of the wavelength and the correspond value of n the rydberg constant can be calculate use the rydberg formula the first step be to set up the spectrometer so it be properly align and focus this be imperative for accurate and precise measurement the eyepiece be focus so that an object around 5 metre away be focus on the cross wire the telescope camera lens and eyepiece be align with the axis of the collimator and a sodium lamp be switch on and position close behind the slit a sodium lamp be use for the set up because it can be switch on for longer than hydrogen and allows for all set-up measurement to be make the focus of the collimator be adjust so that a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire the reading of the vernier scale be take so a `` 0° `` angle be note a see in table 1. the telescope be move through 90° and a mirror be insert in the diffraction grate holder the grate table be turn back until a reflect image of the slit in the mirror be see through the eyepiece which meant that the grate surface be at 45° to the incident beam from the collimator this angle be note the grate table be then move again through precisely 45° so it be accurately set at a new `` 0° `` normal incidence this angle will be use a the zero point for all measurement the mirror be replace with a diffraction grate and the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp finally the spectral line be observe through the telescope to ensure the spectrometer be set up correctly two different diffraction grate be use to observe the spectral line in the preliminary measurement one be approximately 78.8 line per mm and the other be 300 line per mm it be see that the different order line be much more disperse in the 300 line per mm a see in figure 4 and be of high intensity meaning that individual spectral line be much clearer and more distinct from other line when use the 300 line per mm grate this grate be kept in the holder and be use for the rest of the experiment another observation be that there be only three colour red aqua and blue that be clear enough to measure and that spectral line with order great than two be extremely difficult to measure therefore data be take for these three colour with order m=-2 to m=2 in addition the zero th order spectral line be in the same position for each colour so one measurement be sufficient for all colour intermittently an array of unusual colour be see through the eyepiece cause by desk lamp switch on and off around the room a a result the spectrometer be shield from external light use black card and the hydrogen lamp be move closer to the slit the centre of each spectral line for the three colour from m=-2 to m=2 be measure by each lab partner to reduce human error and to give a value for the statistical `` 0° `` angle 168° 44 `` 90° `` angle 78° 44 `` 45° `` angle 340° 58 new `` 0° `` angle 169° 04 e=hf e=hf uncertainty however a big source of be the width of the spectral line because 𝜃 could lie anywhere within that width accord to the bohr model spectral line should not have thickness because the value for energy be discrete however due to various effect broadening of spectral line occur effect such a natural broadening pressure broadening and opacity broadening can all increase the line thickness but the most considerable broadening in the visible spectrum be due to thermal doppler broadening 1 this be when hydrogen gas be hot so atom move with different velocity and therefore have different frequency due to the doppler shift this then result in a wider range of frequency and broadens the spectral line the only way to reduce this would be to cool hydrogen gas to very low temperature which be not possible for this experiment consequently the start and end of each spectral line be also measure and average to find the uncertainty of the angle a graph of sin 𝜃 against m be plot for the three colour red aqua and blue the width of the spectral line be measure to be 0.3° 1s.f so the uncertainty in the angle be ±0.2° 1s.f the uncertainty in the gradient be calculate by plot a graph of maximum gradient and minimum gradient for each colour and then calculate half of the difference between them this be carry through to the error in wavelength where the fractional error of the gradient and the slit separation would have be add in quadrature however error in the slit separation if any would be extremely small a the slit separation be approximately 3 × 10 −6 so this error be deem negligible therefore the fractional error of the gradient be simply multiply by the wavelength to obtain the uncertainty in the wavelength compare these value to the know value a see in figure 6 they be fairly accurate and within the range of the uncertainty this show that the correct error be account for this be far discus in the latter part of this section see a the wavelength for red be the large and the wavelength for blue be the small it can be infer from the planck-einstein relation that for red n=3 for aqua n=4 and for blue n=5 substitute this into the rydberg formula the follow result be achieve table 3. result for the rydberg constant for red aqua and blue spectral line and the calculate average rydberg constant the error in the rydberg constant for each colour be calculate use the derivative of the rydberg formula multiply by the error of the wavelength the follow formula be use where 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ be the error in the rydberg constant and 𝜎 𝜆 be the error in the wavelength the fractional error of the rydberg constant for the three colour be then add in quadrature to obtain the error for the average rydberg constant therefore the final value for the rydberg constant be 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f this differs from the know value of 10973731.6 m -1 which be approximately 100000 m -1 less than the value found in this experiment the know value be within the uncertainty meaning that the error be account for the difference be most likely due to the wrong angle of the spectral line be measure a only the midpoint of a range of angle be note down however the gradient wavelength red 0.196±0.002 653±7nm aqua 0.145±0.002 482±7nm blue 0.129±0.002 430±7nm difference could also be due to human error when reading the angle off the vernier scale the angle could be interpret differently by separate people because where the vernier scale aligns with the main scale can be difficult to see also the aqua blue colour at high order become very faint and be much harder to place at the crosswire which may have result in slightly erroneous measurement this result have a percentage error of 2.7 which be very high see the equipment use be extremely precise the value of this error come from the measure value of the width of the spectral line which be 0.3° this width could not be decrease a it be due to local condition around the element which be uncontrollable with the available resource therefore this be the best precision possible to improve more advanced technology could be use to decrease the spectral line broadness and find more precise value for wavelength and the rydberg constant the fact that all three value for the rydberg constant be high than the know value suggests a systematic error this could have be due to several effect some more likely than others least likely would be spectrometer misalignment and defocus because the setup and preliminary check be do carefully and rigorously however a calibration error may have be overlook there may have be an error in the diffraction grate such a too little or too many line however this be also unlikely a they be of professional quality the lamp position and background light do affect the experiment initially but solution to these problem be quickly found the solution may have be inadequate but the position of spectral line would not have be affected by this greatly most likely be temperature air pressure and humidity which may have shift frequency and make them large meaning the centre of the spectral line measure may have give a small wavelength and therefore a large rydberg constant overall the aim of the experiment be to calculate the value of the rydberg constant the method use involve measure the angle of hydrogen spectral line and calculate the wavelength by use path difference and phase difference formula and plot a graph from this the rydberg constant be calculate use the rydberg formula and the constant be found to be 11100000±300000 m -1 error to 1s.f this value be accurate but not very precise when compare to the know value of 10973731.6 m -1 the lack of precision be cause by the broadness of the spectral line which increase the uncertainty and may have cause systematic error to improve more consideration can be take to reduce the thickness of the spectral line and well evaluation of potential systematic error can be make overall the experiment calculate the rydberg constant accurately because the know value be within the range of the measure value and successfully demonstrate many aspect of spectroscopy,expert,bal

wavelength for this report 'blue will refer to transition 4 → 2 and 'dark blue/purple will refer to transition 5 → 2 a show in figure 1. light from a lamp be aim through a single slit before be collimate through a lens/collimator the light be then disperse through the grate before be refocus through the camera to the eyepiece the eyepiece could then be rotate to observe the position of different fringe the angle through which the light be bent and thus the position of each fringe depend on the width of the slit in the grate related in equation 2. for the repeatability of result and proper calibration the follow apparatus set-up procedure be follow the eyepiece and the crosshair be align and focus on an object around 5m away to eliminate parallax between the image and crosshair the telescope compose of the camera lens and eyepiece be angle so that it be parallel with the collimator the collimator focus be then alter to give an image of maximum clarity the telescope be then rotate through exactly 90° a measure on the angular scale the grate be place in it holder on the turntable of the spectrometer and adjust so that the collimate light pas through it the grate use be 78.8 line per mm the turntable be then rotate until a reflect image of the entrance slit be directly behind the crosshair give an angle of exactly 45° which be record before the turntable be rotate through exactly 45° thus set to 0° rotate in either direction from this zero reference allow angular position of fringe to be determine with rotation in opposite direction have opposite sign define one direction a positive meant reading could take both side of zero give more data with which to plot a graph thus reduce uncertainty in the gradient of each graph the fringe number and colour with it associate angular displacement be record in degree and arc minute for each fringe these value be then convert to radian before a graph of sin θ m against m be plot for each colour give gradient a λ d a d represent the distance between slit which be the inverse of line density of the grate the wavelength of the fringe could be calculate use equation 4 r h can then be found from equation 2 it be clear that a graph of sin θ m against fringe order m should show a linear relationship both red and blue plot show this after plot the blue result figure 4 it be notice that all point have a similar gradient but there be a step in value between the m=0 and m=1 fringe this imply incorrect label of fringe number by change point m=1,2 to point m=2,3 respectively the far more concordant graph be plot show in figure 5. the difference become even more apparent on plot the residual of the original and correct plot a in figure 6. the variance of the correct residual be 7 time small than that of the uncorrected plot 2.81×10 −5 v 1.97×10 −4 strongly improve quality of the line of best fit and the final result fig 6 residual for both blue plot calculate by subtract y coordinate of each point from the position of the line of best fit at that same point from the gradient of these figure the wavelength of red fringe be calculate a 661 ± 8 nm consistent with table i and the blue wavelength be calculate a 510 ± 20 nm meaning the accepted value be narrowly outside the range of experimental uncertainty the value of r h be determine a 1.09±0.01 ×10 7 m −1 use the calculate red wavelength and 1.05 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 use the calculate blue wavelength give a final value of 1.07 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 meaning the accepted value of 1.10×10 7 m −1 1 be within range of the experimental error of the calculate result a major shortcoming of this study be an insufficient number of result for dark blue/purple fringe allow only two value for r h to be found this difficulty be probably due to the closeness of first order fringe simply masking/blurring the position of individual fringe this mean that there be so much overlap between fringe it be hard to identify where one fringe end and another begin a way to reduce this effect in the future would be to use a grate with a great line density reduce slit separation d. from equation 2 it be see that would increase the value of sin θ m for each give fringe which for an angle 90°would also be an increase in θ m with each colour spread out by a different angle due to different wavelength this would mean less fringe overlap and well fringe identification a large assumption in the result be the allocation of error the manufacturer-stated uncertainty of the grate spectrometer be impressively small a little a three part in ten thousand 8 the uncertainty in the fringe position be in fact much great than this a the position of the centre of a give fringe be subject to the judgement of the equipment operator this be because the fringe be not a precisely locate extremely small line but a bright section of differ intensity thus error associate with fringe angle be far great than the minimum uncertainty of the spectrometer for the purpose of error bar on our result a modest estimate be use this be found by measure the width of a large fringe a the centre must be contain within the full width of the fringe a large fringe be chosen a use a small fringe could have be an underestimate for large fringe whereas use a large fringe give an overestimate for small fringe it be more responsible to use the overestimate this be quote a the error for every fringe ±0.6° give ±0.01 for uncertainty in sin θ m although this be n't an accurate way of assign uncertainty time constraint do not allow u to take a reading for every fringe thus more advanced error analysis be not available to u it be also large enough to encompass aforementioned error such a that associate with the spectrometer itself and the discrepancy between r h and r ∞ a more suitable way of assign error in the future would involve take two value for each fringe the small and great angle at which the fringe can be see the mean of which give the value to be record this give a more appropriate value for each fringe and particularly for small fringe should reduce uncertainty give a more accurate determination of r h it be worth mention that the value for r h a calculate use only the red fringe be both more accurate and precise than the final value average both the blue and red value with error combine in quadrature this show how remarkably less accurate the blue fringe be than the red this may due to an observational error in result confusion of colour a show in figure 1 the purple/dark blue and light blue fringe appear much more similar than either do with the red consequently it may be true that one or more of the 'blue point in figure 5 belong on a different graph in the future clearly identify colour at the start of the experiment could reduce uncertainty in the result by provide a whole extra set of purple/dark blue data and reduce variance from line of best fit in blue result this could be do by calculate the theoretical angle at which a fringe of each colour would be see use data in table i with equation 2. the telescope could then be adjust to this position and the colour at/nearest this point identify a that colour from table i for future reading all these improvement rely on more time for completion of the experiment a set-up of the equipment take up a large portion of the available time improve the efficiency of set up the equipment would allow more reading to be take increase accuracy in determine value of r h the aim of the experiment be to find an accurate value for the rydberg constant by analysis of the hydrogen emission spectrum use a grate spectrometer upon calculation of the wavelength of two different set of colour fringe and comparison to the balmer series two value for r h be found use the balmer equation vary degree of accuracy and approximately determine error limited reliability however the final result be both accurate and precise with the accepted value 1.10 × 10 7 m −1 within the range of uncertainty of the empirical value 1.07 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 in the case of this experiment be repeat a few simple improvement described in this report should be implement include a well

order take for each visible balmer line be five however some order be not visible such a m= -5 for red very few order be visible for balmer gamma which be see a a violet colour many of the violet fringe be dim and the position could not be determine accurately therefore the position of the fringe be take a approximation which result in a high uncertainty for the value of 𝜃. only two negative order fringe be visible for balmer gamma however the number of positive order slit which could be see be up to m 5. the size of the collimator slit be make to be quite large to increase the intensity of the fringe visible so they could be see clearly and to allow measurement of up to five positive and negative order to be take however this result in a large fringe width the fringe could no longer be approximate a slit due to the large fringe width and the position of the centre of the slit have to be approximate the light from the other experiment which be be conduct in the room might have

fringe width cause the high uncertainty in the calculation of the wavelength of the balmer line of hydrogen and 𝑅 ∞ therefore for future experiment the hydrogen lamp should be allow to cool for longer period of time between measurement so that the intensity of the visible fringe increase and the position of the fringe can be take more accurately a strong intensity hydrogen lamp should also be use so that the collimator slit size can be reduce and therefore the uncertainty due to the fringe width the experiment should also be conduct in a completely dark room to reduce the uncertainty due to the background light another suggestion for a more accurate measurement of 𝑅 ∞ would be to use a computer-aided diffraction grate spectrometer 1 the aim of the experiment be to measure the hydrogen balmer series and to calculate the value of the rydberg constant r∞ use a diffraction grate spectrometer three line of the balmer series balmer alpha beta and gamma be observe however the fourth line

multiple order be take on both side of the zero order and this be use to find a wavelength for each colour use equation 2 before take any measurement use the grate spectrometer it first have to be align and focus this be do use a sodium lamp when a lamp be require we first ensure that there be no parallax between the image and cross hair by focus the eyepiece and camera lens then the telescope

incidence and where the zero order should be finally the height of the image be adjust use the grate screw to ensure the image be at the right height for measurement and be not tilt which would affect the reading the setup can be see in figure 1 below figure 1 the figure above show the basic setup of the grate spectrometer where light come in from the source to the left the hydrogen lamp in this experiment the light pas through the collimator and then through the diffraction grate where it diffracts and the spectral line can be see through the telescope rotate the telescope clockwise show the negative order spectral line and the positive order line can be see by rotate the telescope anti-clockwise collimator telescope positive order after note down the zero order angle the hydrogen lamp be use to obtain the first set of reading we decide that reading on both side of the zero order would be take to reduce the uncertainty in the experiment one set of positive and negative order measurement for one colour would be take by me and then the lamp would be allow to cool the second set of reading for the same colour would be take by my partner after the lamp be consider cool enough for use this process be use to obtain measurement for all three colour this ensure that any systematic error or bias when reading the scale due to a single person reading the scale would not carry over in the analysis of the result and into the final conclusion if the hydrogen lamp be switch on for long period of time it produce very blurry line to prevent this from affect measurement the lamp be switch off periodically and allow to cool when take measurement of the different colour and their respective order the centre of these band be difficult to determine and can easily produce large uncertainty this meant that our method of determine the angle have to be change and so we chose to select the edge of the band closest to zero order and use this a our reference point for each colour and order the angle that be collect in the measurement for each order and colour be then subtract from the zero order angle for each respective measurement and this angle be θ for each different order which be then substitute into equation 2 where d be 1/78800 the diffraction grate have 78.8 line per mm so d be 1/lines per m this result in multiple wavelength for each colour red purple and blue so

commonly accepted value of 1.09678x10 7 m -1 and it could be due to multiple reason one reason could be that the measurement of the angle be not perfect and that there be inaccurate reading due to human error another possible cause could be the wrong alignment and focus of the grate spectrometer which could result in reading that be far from accurate a final cause for the discrepancy could be that due to the slightly blur line in the purple spectral line the edge be not a definitive a it be for the other colour and this could likely affect our reading and the error could propagate when

±82490m −1 thus the true value 10,973,731.6 m −1 fall just outside the estimate margin of error the experimental process involves set up a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp in order to determine the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission spectrum in this experiment wavelength value for the red and blue spectral line be calculate each of these value be then combine with the knowledge of the balmer series and use in rydberg 's equation to get two separate value for r∞ one for each colour these value be then average to give the final value for r∞ t he rydberg constant r ∞ be a constant that appear in rydberg 's equation which predicts the wavelength of spectral light a a result of electron move between energy level in an atom when an element 's gaseous state be heat atom will absorb energy result in electron be excite and move from low energy state to high one when these electron de-excite back down to low energy level they release photon of specific energy correspond to the atom 's energy level because of this each element have a distinct spectral fingerprint this discovery form the basis of the study of spectroscopy this lab report describes an experiment which u a diffraction grate spectrometer to measure r ∞ the experiment first involves carefully set up the collimator grate and eyepiece so that the slit image be focus precisely at the cross wire inside the telescope once this be do the eyepiece be turn through various angle to look for spectral line the angle at which the spectral line occur be measure use a vernier scale built into the spectrometer table the angle and the order associate with each of the colour line be then record and compile to produce a dataset which can be graph in python a sin θ vs. order m for each colour the gradient of each graph be equal to λ d where d be the slit separation of the grate thus the value of λ can be obtain by multiply the value of the gradient by d. this value for λ be then substitute into rydberg 's equation to calculate r ∞ for that colour these value of r ∞ can then be average to obtain a final value for r ∞ the rydberg constant a mention in section i appear in rydberg 's equation which relates the wavelength of spectral line λ to the integer energy level of the initial and final energy state of the atom n and p respectively r ∞ be calculate by work out the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission spectrum and substitute the value into rydberg 's equation to understand how the emission spectrum for hydrogen be produce we must consider an important piece of apparatus for the experimentthe hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be essentially a long tube with two electrode on each end fill with hydrogen gas when a large potential difference be apply between the two electrode electron from the circuit be accelerate through the gas from one electrode to the other a the electron flow through the tube some of them may collide with atomic electron in the hydrogen gas 1 to understand the physic of what happens at this stage we can use the bohr model of the atom in the bohr model electron travel in circular orbit around the nucleus the energy of these orbit be proportional to the electron 's distance from the nucleus -the far the electron the high the energy most importantly the model state that the only stable orbit allow for the electron be those in which the electron 's angular momentum be an integer multiple h. thus electron can only orbit at discrete distance from the nucleus -orbits be quantize these quantize orbit be more commonly know a energy level and they be specific to each element 2 fig 1. the bohr model of the hydrogen atom show the electron tranisions represent the lymer blamer and paschen series now when an accelerate circuit electron with enough energy collides with the atomic electron in the energy level the atomic electron will absorb energy equal to that of the energy difference between two energy level this will excite the electron to that high energy level the excite electron will then de-excite back down to a low energy level and in the process emit a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the two energy level here be the key point -as each element have specific energy level only certain wavelength of light can be produce for each element more specifically only light of wavelength hc e where e be the energy difference between the two energy level will be emit from the lamp these specific frequency of light make up the emission spectrum for the element in the case of the hydrogen lamp the light emit from the lamp be only compose of frequency correspond to hydrogen 's emission spectrum however one of the key part of the experiment involves actually work out what the wavelength of hydrogen 's emission spectrum be in order to do this we need to use another key bit of apparatus -a diffraction grate use this we need to find a formula which relates the wavelength of the line to other feature of the apparatus such a the angle through which the telescope be turn this equation can be derive in the follow manner a diffraction grate can be thought of a a large number n of equally space narrow slit with slit separation d. for light of wavelength λ a principal maximum occurs when the phase difference between the two ray be an integer multiple m of 2π from fig 1. we can see that the path difference between two light ray be d sin θ thus where m be know a the order number thus if we gain a set in 1885 swiss physicist johann balmer deduce by trial and error that the wavelength of light spectrum emit by hydrogen atom follow the relationship where r be a constant which be now know a the rydberg constant r ∞ 3 however balmer suggest that this relationship could be generalise and it take swedish physicist johannes rydberg in 1889 to find the general formula now know a rydberg 's formula where n p for the hydrogen atom p 2 corresponds to the balmer series other series have also be calculate such a the ultraviolet lyman series for p 1 and the infrared paschen series for p 3 however these be less important for this experiment a none of these series produce visible emission line for the balmer hydrogen series there be 4 main emission line the red line h α corresponds to n 3 the turquoise/green line h β corresponds to n 4 the blue line h γ corresponds to n 5 and the purple/indigo line h δ corresponds to n 6 4 fig 3. the line spectrum for hydrogen depend on which colour line be see the appropriate value of n and p 2 should be use in rydberg 's equation this can then be combine with correspond value of λ to calculate r ∞ the setup for this experiment be imperative to it overall success and accuracy so we a take a lot of time to make sure the apparatus be prepared correctly fig 4. show the set up use for this experiment first we need to focus the telescope eyepiece and camera lens the telescope be turn such that it point at a pencil case roughly 5-10 metre away with an unobstructed view without the diffraction grate in place on the table the focus be do in two stage first the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire which be a `` × `` locate inside the telescope by slide the eyepiece in and out until the cross wire be a dark and sharp a possible next the actual camera lens be focus this involve adjust the focus knob on the side of the telescope until the distant pencil case be in sharp focus however just do this will not achieve the correct focus because parallax have n't be consider the way we eliminate parallax be by make use of the cross wire we look through the telescope so we could see both the focus image of the cross wire and the other spectrometer by move our head left and right we saw that the cross wire and the spectrometer move back and forth in sync i.e one do n't move faster than the other this told u that the whole telescope be fully focus and that there be no parallax between the image and the cross wire now that the telescope be fully focus the focus knob on the telescope be not move for the remainder of the experiment after this we need to focus the collimator first the telescope be roughly align with the collimator at this point in a usual spectrometry experiment the light would be turn off an the focus would be test use a hydrogen lamp source however the manufacturer of the lamp recommend that the hydrogen lamp should be switch of every 30 second to prevent the lamp overheat see a the focus of the collimator take considerably longer than 30 second just for this part of the experiment a sodium lamp be use in it place the advantage of use a sodium lamp be that it could be kept switch on all the time the lamp be place close behind the collimator and without change the focus on the camera lens the focus knob on the collimator be adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire a with the previous part the next part of the setup involve align the diffraction grate with the collimator such that the grate be normal to the collimator first we use the previous setup in which the telescope and collimator be align and the telescope be focus on the sodium lamp we then lock the spectrometer table so the table ca n't move and take an angle reading use the verier angle scale due to the fact that the vernier scale on the spectrometer be very small we use a magnify glass to read all our measurement this particular magnify glass use have a bonus feature of double a a torch which make it possible to see the scale in the dark the measurement take be 221 • 38 next we subtract 90 • from this value and move the telescope to that exact value of 131 • 38 then we lock the telescope in place and unlocked the table so that the grate be free to rotate independently of the telescope and collimator afterwards the table be turn until the slit image be see through the telescope which indicate that the grate be roughly at 45 • to both the telescope and collimator to get the image exactly focus on the cross wire we make use of the slow motion drive a knob that move the table very slowly and precisely to make very small adjustment so that the image fell exactly on the cross wire once this be achieve we take a reading at this point of 80 • and add the 45 • back that that the grate be at an angle of 125 • now that grate be normal to the collimator the table be lock and not change for the remainder of the experiment the sodium lamp be then replace with the hydrogen lamp and the remainder of the experiment could begin we start by try to identify colour we saw in the emission spectrum have already study the emission spectrum for hydrogen we knew that there be 4 possible colour red turquoise blue and purple for this experiment the most visible and abundant colour be red and blue we in fact do n't see any turquoise or purple line at all to start with we focus the cross wire on the central maximum or 0th order line which be measure to be at 125 • then start with the red emission line we turn the telescope to the right until our cross wire focus on it 's first red line use the vernier scale we then record the angle measurement use the magnify glass for that line and name it the 1st order maximum m=1 the angle measurement data be then add to a table of order m and angle on the vernier scale θ next we continued to move the telescope to the right until we saw the next red line m 2 and again take the angle reading and add it to the table we continued this process by turn the telescope to the right until we could see no more we then turn the telescope back to the central maximum and repeat this process for by move the telescope to the left in this case we simply call the first line we saw m -1 and the second line m -2 and so on with negative integer this process be then repeat for the blue line and a set of data be obtain relate the scale reading on the vernier scale to the order of the maximum for both the red and blue spectrum line in order to work out lambda for both the red and blue line we need to make two graph of sinθ v m. however the θ in this case be should not be the reading on the vernier scale but should be the angle of the spectral line relative to the central line thus for each reading of θ on the scale we have to take away 125 • to obtain the correct set of value θ co then we could work out sinθ co and plot this against the order number m. one option would be to plot this data by hand however a the range of angle gain be small roughly 20 • for each colour and because we take the measurement to 4 decimal place we decide to plot the graph on python use the sp.polyfit function we have 3 main advantage over draw by hand the function ensures that we can draw a perfect least square line regression line it allows u to perfectly work out the gradient of this line again something we would add error into when find dy and dx and it also automatically work out error bar and gradient value this would prove extremely useful when do uncertainty calculation once the data have be compile and the graph be draw on python we could read off the gradient value for each of the two colour each of the gradient value be then multiply by the slit separation d. the number of line per unit length state on the diffraction grate be 80 slit per millimetre however the diffraction grate in fact u an old definition in imperial unit of 2001 line per inch this can therefore be approximate a 78.8 line per millimetre thus the slit separation d 1.269 × 10 −5 for each colour we then use the appropriate value of n and p from the balmer series the balmer series state that the red line come from transition of electron from the 3rd to the 2nd energy level -thus n 3 for red spectral line by the same reason n 5 for blue spectral line by definition the balmer series be for when p 2 thus p 2 for both colour finally the value of n p and λ be plug into the rydberg equation and a value of r ∞ be obtain for each colour both value be then average to get a final value for r ∞ the final result obtain forr ∞ from this experiment be 1.089 × 10 7 ± 82490m −1 therefore the standard accepted value of 10,973,731.6m −1 lie just outside the margin of error a table of the data represent the result for the red emission line angle be show in table i and the result for the blue emission line angle be show in table ii table iii show all final result that have be derive use the method discus in section iv θ co represent the correct angle explain in section iv graph of both these set of data be show in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the error calculate in table iii be easy to calculate and merely involve use the standard error combine rule however the procedure in calculate the initial error begin when align the diffraction grate when the telescope be first align with collimator with the cross wire focus on the central image an angle reading of 221 • 38 be take however there be an error of ±0.5 on this reading due to this be half of the small measurable interval on the scale thus when the telescope be then turn through 90 • the new angle which the telescope be at be 131 • 38 ±0.5 next the diffraction grate be focus exactly at 45 • to both the telescope and the collimator again by make use of the cross wire then an angle reading of 80 • be take use the vernier scale again once more this reading include an error of ±0.5 thus when the diffraction grate be turn back there be yet again the same error for the same reason therefore the diffraction grate be normal to the collimator with an error of ±1 this mean that the error for any singular reading be ±1.5 a it include the add error of the grate calibration but also the ±0.5 error of any reading take at an angle θ co to the central fringe the uncertainty in λ be directly calculate in python by use the function matplotlib and scipy we be able to directly read off the uncertainty for both wavelength σ λr 2.42nm for the red line and σ λb 6.66nm for the blue line for each colour an associate rydberg constant value could be obtained.the error be calculate in the form k λ 2 × σ λ where k be equal to λ be the wavelength of the colour and σ λ be the uncertainty in λ. finally the two value of r ∞ be average and the uncertainty be add in quadrature and halve to obtain the uncertainty in r ∞ give above in this report we present the result of an experiment to determine rydberg 's constant r ∞ by study the spectral line of hydrogen the data be finally compile to determine the value of r ∞ a 1.089 × 10 7 ± 82490m −1 unfortunately the true value of 10,973,731.6 m −1 be just outside the error of margin for this result suggest that the experiment could have be improve one aspect that could have improve the overall accuracy be carry out the same procedure for the aqua and purple spectral line however we be not able to clearly identify line from these colour this may have be due to the fact that the hydrogen lamp be kept on for too long if this experiment be to be carry out again we would make sure that the lamp be turn off every 30 second to allow the lamp to remain cool another possibility it that the error of ±1.5 for the angle reading be indeed too low due to the small size of the vernier scale and the of take reading use a large magnify glass in the dark it be possible that the error on the angle be more on the order of ±5",superficial,the
22,GS_TAP080_Redacted,in this experiment we use a grate spectrometer to obtain data on the visible emission spectrum of hydrogen to deduce the rydberg constant this require the balmer transition

between neighbour ray of light a can be see from figure 1 the path difference equal d sin θ. hence fig 1 this figure be a schematic representation of a spectrometer the collimate lens make the light from the source passing through the narrow slit parallel this light travel perpendicular to the grate which be diffract and focus onto the cross-hair by the camera a camera allows for a magnify image to be view through the eyepiece the inset show the path difference d sin θ. cite from 1 and therefore where m be the order number of the maximum a an example for n 4 slit the fringe pattern show in figure 2 occurs when n slit be illuminate the first minimum occurs at a phase angle the resolve power of the spectrometer be essential a we can identify the minimum difference in wavelength such that two spectral line can be distinguish clearly we can find this by consider the fact that minimum in a certain diffraction fig 2 the diffraction pattern see when n 4 show the principal minimum and maximum cite from 1 pattern occur at the same position a the maximum in a different pattern this can be see in figure 3 where light have a second wavelength λ 2 λ − ∆λ produce it m th principal maximum at a slightly different angle θ 2 where d sin θ 2 mλ 2 a minimum will occur at angle θ if by substitute for d sin θ use equation 5 and 6 the difference in wavelength ∆λ λ−λ 2 where ∆λ λ. consequently where λ ∆λ be the resolve power r. this mean that the small difference in wavelength ∆λ which can be distinguish at a wavelength λ can be found halfway between two equal spectral line the intensity be approximately 20 less than the peak equation 8 represent the separation at which this occurs and thus the two line be distinguishable from each other in this experiment we use a 300 line per mm grate which mean n be large and hence ∆λ be small which mean the spectrometer can resolve spectral line to a very small difference in wavelength the rydberg formula for the transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by where r ∞ be the rydberg constant and n and p be integer represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the hydrogen atom respectively the accurately measure value of the rydberg constant r ∞ be 10973731.6 m −1 r ∞ can be express in term of fundamental constant a where α be the fine structure constant m e the mass of the electron c the speed of light and h planck 's constant α can be express a where h be the reduce planck constant e be the charge of an electron and 0 the permittivity of free space note that α be dimensionless where 1/α ∼ 134.036. the balmer series be the series of spectral line emit by an excite hydrogen atom in the visible spectrum and be give by equation 9 with the value of p 2 and n 3 4 5 .. this be for the atom drop from the n th energy level to the second i.e p 2 energy level figure 4 show this for n 3 4 with p 2. this cause a photon of frequency in the visible spectrum to be give off by use a colour chart and equation 9 it be possible to calculate the expect value of λ and identify the colour of light expect to be observe in the spectrum reference 1 and 2 be use to explain the theory the spectrometer need careful adjustment and set up before it could be use a schematic representation of the spectrometer be show in figure 1. we adjust the eyepiece by observe the emission spectrum of sodium atom use a sodium lamp such that the image be at a convenient view distance we use a sodium lamp for adjustment instead of a hydrogen lamp because leave the hydrogen lamp for too long cause weak transition from molecular hydrogen to be observe but most importantly the hydrogen line grow weaker and dimmer in time and become difficult to observe the camera lens be focus by bring a distant object into focus -in our case we focus on a lamp-post on the street we do this so that there be no parallax between the cross hair and the image the telescope be then align with the axis of the collimator the sodium lamp be place close to the slit and the focus of the collimator be adjust to produce a sharp image of the slit at the cross hair we set the cross hair to an `` x `` rather than a `` `` a this make it easy to focus it centre on the centre of a maximum thereby achieve a more accurate measurement of the angular displacement it be very important to understand what each clamp screw and slow motion drive do a turn the wrong one could disrupt the whole setup the rotate telescope scale read from 0 − 360 • the scale be read relative to a zero fiducial reading on the vernier scale which be fix to the rotate table base the vernier scale read in arcminute or sixtieth of a degree the telescope be then move through precisely 90 • and clamped into position a mirror be put into the grate holder and the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit be see in the eyepiece do this ensures that the incident beam from the collimator be 45 • to the mirror surface this be confirm by now replace the mirror with the 300 line per mm grate many orange sodium spectral line be observe but line the median line with the crosshair ensures that the grate surface be 45 • to the beam the grate surface be fragile and hence great care be take not to touch it the screw under the grate table be use to set the height of the slit image the aperture be decrease to obtain a solid vertical spectral line the grate drive be use to set the grate such that the slit image be precisely at the cross hair note the reading on both the scale a an initial reading the grate be then rotate precisely through 45 • this ensures the grate be accurately set and the beam be normal to it surface the spectral line be observe through the telescope and be note to be above the plane define by the cross hair this occur because the grate ruling be not parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope to correct this a diffract image of the slit at a large angle of diffraction be observe the appropriate grate adjustment screw be use to rotate the grate in the plane of it surface to low the image it be essential to only rotate the grate in the plane of it surface to ensure that the incident beam be still normal to it surface we could now proceed with the experiment to use the spectrometer to make accurate repeatable measurement the sodium lamp be now replace with the hydrogen lamp the main scale reading combine with the vernier scale reading give the total angle the vernier scale reading be obtain by observe which vernier ruling line up with a ruling on the fix scale the angular displacement

line to be observe the value for λ obtain from each gradient yield a minimal uncertainty a be see in table i -the large percentage uncertainty be 0.72 for red light d have negligible uncertainty which implies that the uncertainty in the value of λ be only dependent on the uncertainty in the gradient of the line of best fit from equation 12 the uncertainty in the gradient be dependent on the consistency and accuracy of our measurement for θ. a the spectrometer be a very accurate instrument capable of a precision of under three part in ten thousand 1 the error do not originate from the limitation of the setup but be systematic far n and p be constant and hence the systematic error in r ∞ originates from that in λ. our value for r ∞ a give in equation 14 differ by 0.97 from the true value far an error of 0.31 on the mean be very small and do not include the true value this suggests the presence of a small systematic error there be several potential source of systematic error parallax be the major source of systematic error a we have to use a magnify glass to identify the position where the vernier ruling coincide with the fix scale ruling from various view angle the ruling be very close to each other the process even more difficult we estimate the error in θ due to this difficulty a 2 arcminute and parallax a 1 arcminute to the vernier reading -a total error of 3 arcminute these error be include in the previous calculation but i believe parallax would have add an error of 0.2 • to our central maximum fiducial reading if this be account for the modify python code produce the revise value of r ∞ r ∞ 10 960 000 ± 40 000 m −1 15 a can be see in equation 15 the revise r ∞ and it error include the true value it now differs from the true value by 0.1 the zero error on the scale be non existent however a the experiment be perform on two separate day this meant that we have to use the instrument a be set-up by the group precede u there may have be a change in the spectrometer use thus ever so slightly affect measurement even though we re-configured the entire instrument additionally we have to re-configure the spectrometer a the wrong clamp screw be turn which meant that the scale be not fix and our setup be disrupt when the telescope be move this may have cause the telescope to be slightly mis-aligned with the collimator while measure θ the table that the spectrometer sits on would move slightly which would be re-adjusted this would slightly affect lamp position even though we have marked the fix position of the lamp relative to the table this could potentially add some error far not focus the cross-hair on the exact centre of the spectral line may have also cause a very slight error in θ in the order of less than 1 arcminute -negligible background light from the computer and lamp be use by the other group perform the experiment would sometimes be see through the telescope which make focus the cross-hair difficultperhaps add an error in the order of less than 1 arcminute a well although negligible if all these source of systematic error be account for by re-visiting the experiment and quantify the error a with parallax the value for r ∞ achieve would be even closer to the true value reduce the percentage difference to small than even 0.1 while reduce the error on it v. conclusion in this report we aim to calculate the rydberg constant by use a spectrometer we measure the angular displacement of each order maximum the grate equation be use to calculate the wavelength of the spectral line observe eventually the balmer series for hydrogen be use to obtain a value for the rydberg constant our initial value r ∞ 11080000 ± 30000 m −1 differ by 0.97 from the true value after accounting for the source of systematic error in the experiment with the major source be parallax the revise value r ∞ 10960000 ± 40000 m −1 differ only by 0.1 and include the true value within the error far source of error which would decrease the percentage difference even more be also suggest this indicates that the experiment be a success in obtain an accurate value for r ∞ to improve the experiment far we would complete the entire experiment in one day instead -thus eliminate the effect of a change of set-up furthermore take additional repeat would only reduce the error on the value this experiment highlight the need for error analysis and how to account for systematic error the experience gain in python error propagation will be useful for future experiment,prediction,bal
23,GS_WFX625_Redacted,this paper discus the method use to outline an experiment to determine a value for rydberg 's constant use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer to determine the wavelength of the various spectral line we take data for the two most visible spectral line red and blue and calculate a value for rydberg 's constant from both we obtain a final value of 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 despite the experimental method we use have low systematic and random error due to the high resolution of the grate spectrometer use we believe the final result 's error be mainly due to the fact that only the red and blue spectral line be use this be because they be the only two spectral line we could take accurate and precise data for he rydberg constant be an important constant link the wavelength of several element spectrum with their atomic structure and be originally introduce by johannes robert rydberg 1854-1919 when he publish his find in 1890 on the emission spectrum of certain element 1 originally of empirical nature the rydberg constant be use in an equation that attempt to find some sort of order in the line of emission spectrum of the element when precise measurement of the wavelength of the emission spectrum of the element be carry out it soon become clear that some of the line fell into pattern the line would start out initially space out and start to crowd together these pattern be call 'spectral series and a the different line in the series can be label n n+1 n+2 and so forth the correspond wavelength label a 𝜆n physicist begin to explore and try and find the mathematical relationship between 𝜆n and n. rydberg analytically found a solution the problem with the equation 𝑛 𝑁 0 where n be the wavenumber 1/𝜆 where 𝜆 be the wavelength n0 be rydberg 's constant first calculate to be 109721.6cm -1 and m and p be integer that be specific to the member of the series 1 rydberg found that his equation fit the balmer series the spectral series for the emission spectrum of hydrogen use p 2 and m ≥ 3. this equation provide an accurate representation for many spectral series of different element but be conceive purely through observation and calculation the scientific theory to support it come more than 20 year later when bohr use the idea that the frequency of the photon emit by an atom be directly proportional to the difference in energy state which give m and p meaning the initial and final energy state 2 the rydberg constant could now be express a where r be the rydberg constant with an accepted measure value of 10973731.6m -1 me the mass of the electron c the speed of light h plank 's constant and 𝛼 the fine structure constant which can be far express by the follow equation where e be the charge of an electron 𝜖0 be the permittivity of free space and h be the reduce planck constant in our experiment we observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen with a grate spectrometer in order to find a value for rydberg 's constant a grate spectrometer be necessary so we could take multiple reading and measure the wavelength of different member of the balmer series although due to experimental condition only the first two red and blue be clearly visible enough to take consistent record the diffraction grate be simply a large number n of narrow slit all an equal d away from each other 3 the path difference between neighbour ray from a diffraction grate be 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 and so where m be the order number of the diffraction pattern this show that a d and 𝜆 be constant 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 and the order number should be directly proportional we use this fact by measure the angle at successive order number and graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against the order number to yield a straight line with gradient equal to 𝜆/d in this experiment we use a diffraction grate with 78.8 line per millimeter which mean d be 0.127mm use the grate spectrometer a show in fig 1 require setup and calibration of the three section of the equipment firstly we have to adjust the camera so it would be in focus with collimate light we do this by point determine rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp t the camera at an object on the other side of the laboratory room about 30m away a the object be sufficiently far enough away that the light ray come from it will be collimate themselves now that the camera be calibrate for collimate light we adjust the collimator by rotate the camera back in line with the collimator and use a sodium lamp we use sodium lamp a a substitute for hydrogen lamp a they do not heat up a easily and we would have to turn off the hydrogen lamp every few minute which would disrupt the calibration we adjust the focus ring on the collimator until the slit through which the light be come through be in focus with the diffraction grate now in place we now align the camera with the grate in order to align them we use the vernier scale which could measure the angle at a resolution of 1 arcminute all angle measurement have a very small uncertainty of ±1 arcminute a we have a magnify glass and take careful measurement each time finally we adjust the orientation of the grate by adjust the screw on the platform that held it this be key a it ensures that the distance between adjacent slit be d a if it have be rotate the distance would actually be dcosθ where θ be the angle between the horizontal plane and the bottom of the grate we ensure that the angle be minimize by use the camera and diffraction grate themselves by rotate and slowly sweep the camera through the various order we observe the spectral line gradually get high due to the grate 's orientation we adjust the orientation to minimize this effect and stop when the effect be not noticeable the grate spectrometer be now ready to be use we swap the sodium lamp for a hydrogen lamp and adjust the slit width on the collimator to find a balance between allow enough light through to be able to see the spectral line of high order but not too much that the line would be out of focus we begin measure the angle of the camera whenever the crosshair align with a spectral line for successive order number we decide to adjust the orientation of the crosshair so that the line be at a 45° angle this make it considerably easy to estimate the position of a spectral line we believe this be due to the four line act a a reference to compare the position of the spectral line to whereas if the crosshair be rotate vertically so the orientation have that of a '+ sign the horizontal line do not help u at all in closing down on a spectral line we measure and record once again with a resolution of 1 arcminute the angle for ±3 order include the zeroth order of the diffraction pattern of the blue and red spectral line in order to determine their wavelength although there be other colour present they be too faint to get consistent reliable result with a large enough range the result for the angle of the various order of the red and blue spectral line be show in table 1 the result show a clear trend of a roughly 3° interval between red order and a roughly 2° interval between blue order this be consistent with what we expect a red light have a large wavelength than blue light from equation 4 we can see that sinθ be proportional to the wavelength of the light and with a range roughly twenty to thirty degree we know that θ will be roughly proportional with sinθ θ will increase with sinθ we plot a scatterplot of our result of sinθ against the order and calculate the line of best fit by use the scipy polyfit function weight the point all equally a we saw no anomaly and plot the line use the scipy poly1d function the line of best fit be show in fig 2 the different gradient clearly show the different wavelength for red and blue light note that sinθ do not equal 0 at the zeroth order a we decide to keep the start angle consistent with our result and not make everything relative to a zeroth order of 0° fig 3 show our result relative to 0° at the zeroth order to show the result from the grate spectrometer where 'red angle and 'blue angle be the angle for the red spectral line and blue spectral line respectively we originally record the result start at order 0 and work our way into the positive order first we checked the zeroth order again to have the same reference point for the negative order but do not record a mean average a they be the same for both the red and blue spectral line the result show a clear trend of a roughly 3 interval between red order and a roughly 2 interval between blue order a grate spectrometer fig 1 a diagram to show the grate spectrometer that we use in the experiment divide into three main part the collimator the prism table that house the grate and the telescope or camera that contain the eyepiece for u to observe the spectral line through 4 the most noticeable difference would be that the line of best fit now have a positive gradient and they both cross exactly at the zeroth order which be not the case before there be a 7 arcminute difference between the two a our final result for calculate rydberg 's constant be dependent on the gradient of the straight line the fact that they perfectly cross be not important and it be merely a translation of the two line however change the start point so that the angle be 0° at the zeroth order be important a the different value of sinθ will be different at this range most notably there be value of sinθ which be positive but a the sin curve do not have a constant gradient different start point will yield different gradient for our line of best fit this be key a it will affect our final value when calculate rydberg 's constant and so we decide to stay true to our result use equation 4 a the equation of our line of best fit we use 𝜆/d be the gradient of the two straight line we calculate the wavelength of the two spectral line to be 6.16 × 10 −7 𝑚 ± 0.10 × 10 −7 𝑚 ±1.62 for red light and 4.41 × 10 −7 𝑚 ± 0.09 × 10 −7 𝑚 ±2.04 for blue light we calculate the error in the gradient of the straight line use the covariant matrix generate from the sp.polyfit function we then calculate the rydberg constant use equation 1 and use p a 2 and m a 3 and 4 for red and blue light respectively we calculate the rydberg constant to be 10733268.1292m -1 use the red wavelength and 11106867.2335m -1 use the blue wavelength we found that the mean average for the rydberg constant be 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 despite measure the angle for the diffract spectral line to a high degree of accuracy and precision use the vernier scale with a resolution of 1 arcminute we believe that the fact that we only manage to use two spectral line red and blue meant that ultimately our final result have a high standard deviation and therefore error have we be able to see other spectral line and record data for them we would have be able to greatly reduce our standard deviation in our final result overall throughout the experiment we believe we kept the experimental error low due to our careful experimental technique however we be not able to take multiple repeat due to time constraint which could have help to reduce random error and increase the accuracy of our final result but not by much a we encounter no anomaly and all of the data point be within the straight best fit line we have calculate the error bar use the bad case scenario of ±0.5° on all of our angle a the exact position of the spectral line of high order be harder to discern have only seven data point be not ideal either a this increase the uncertainty and error of the gradient of the straight line although increase the number of data point would prove difficult due to the fact that any order above three become increasingly difficult to make out and this would then increase the overall uncertainty for each value of the angle the aim of this experiment be to determine the value for rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer with a 78.8 line/mm grate and a hydrogen lamp use a hydrogen lamp allow u to calculate rydberg 's constant use the balmer series by measure the angle for the various order of red and blue spectral line we obtain a final experimental value for the rydberg constant of 10920067.6814m -1 ± 186799.5522m -1 ±1.71 and decide the large source of error be due to the fact that we only use two different spectral line which give a high standard deviation for our final result we believe this error could be reduce by change the light condition such that the other spectral line can be see and attempt to take data for high order of the diffract line graph of result fig 2 a scatterplot and straight line of best fit for both the red and blue spectral line although there be no anomaly the 0 order for the red and blue spectral line do differ slightly but be within each other give the error bar graph of result with 0 at order zero fig 3 the same result yield a slightly different scatterplot and line of best fit note that this time both line cross exactly at the origin a they have be make to do so,superficial,bal

25,GS_CZD812_Redacted,a grate spectrometer have be set up in order to take accurate measurement of angular displacement from the central maximum of spectral emission line from a hydrogen discharge lamp then use the rydberg formula and the diffraction equation an average experimental value for the rydberg constant have be determine which have be found to be 10 921 266.74 ± 197 635.84 m -1 the percentage difference between the experimental value and the theoretical value calculate use some fundamental constant in atomic physic have be compute to be 0.54 the grate spectrometer be an apparatus that make use of a combination of lens and a diffraction grate in order to separate light into it component colour use the wave property of interference and diffraction one application of this instrument be the technique of spectroscopy which be an important technique that physicist use when study a wide range of object include hot solid hot gas and cold gas this technique be use in order to find the element which an object be make of a each element have it own unique emission spectrum amongst those thing that can be study use spectroscopy there be hydrogen gas investigate the emission line spectrum of the light emit by a hydrogen discharge lamp by measure the angular displacement of it spectral line use a grate spectrometer can be use to determine the value of the rydberg constant this be a quantity name after the swedish physicist johannes rydberg who do work on the hydrogen spectrum 1 the rydberg constant be very significant in atomic physic owe to it connection to the fundamental physical constant m c e h and ε 0 these constant be define in section ii.ii a diffraction grate be a flat sheet of glass or metal rule with straight slit with equal distance between them the diffraction grate of the grate spectrometer have slit which be n -1 m apart where n be the number of slit per metre when two ray emerge from the slit interfere then there be a maximum i.e constructive interference when their phase difference be 2πn where n 1 2 3 … where be the wavelength of the light through the diffraction grate the path difference be s n θ hence where n be the order number of the maximum in the interference pattern n 1 be for the two maximum on either side closest to the principal maximum n 2 be for the two second-closest maximum and so on θ be the angular displacement of the order maximum from the principal maximum and d n -1 of the diffraction grate therefore the final formula be by rearrange equation 1 the formula be equation 2 show that if d be know and θ and n be determine experimentally use the grate spectrometer then a graph of s n θ on the y-axis and n on the x-axis can be plot the gradient of this graph multiply by d would give the wavelength of the monochromatic light 2 ii.ii the rydberg equation and emission spectrum the rydberg equation `` be a theoretical prediction of the wavelength found in the emission line spectrum of hydrogen atom `` 1 these wavelength be give by the formula where be the wavelength of the photon emit from the electron transition or absorbed if the electron start out at the low energy level instead of the high onefor an absorption spectrum r be the rydberg constant and n and p be the principal quantum number of the initial and final energy level of the electron respectively for an emission line spectrum the principal quantum number be the number give to each orbit the small orbit have principal quantum number 1 the next orbit have number 2 and so on in ascend order of size see fig 1 3 figure 1 electron orbit with the principal quantum number and the balmer electron transition 4 the rydberg constant r ∞ can be express by the physical fundamental constant where m be the mass of the electron e be the charge of the electron ε 0 be the permittivity of free space h be planck 's constant a c be the speed of light in a vacuum 1 if p 2 and n be set to the integer from 3 to 7 in equation 3 then the subsequent wavelength calculate make up the balmer series of the spectral line for atomic hydrogen see fig 1 which represent all the electron transition down to orbit 2. the calculate wavelength be part of the visible spectrum and one spectral line wavelength be in the ultraviolet region 1 iii the experimental method in order to measure the angular displacement of spectral line from a hydrogen lamp at the first the grate spectrometer need to be set up and calibrate see fig 2 for final grate spectrometer setup for the setup instead of use a hydrogen lamp a sodium lamp be use because a hydrogen lamp get hot fairly quickly so it be n't suitable for setup because set up the spectrometer take about an hour and fifteen minute 2 at first the eyepiece be focus on the crosswire and then the camera lens be focus such that a distant object be focus on the cross wire for the second part the distant object be a tree the grate spectrometer be take to be point out of the window 2 afterwards the telescope be turn to be align with the axis of the collimator the collimator focus be adjust to get a sharp image of the crosswire 2 then the telescope be move through 90° and a diffraction grate d 1/ 3x10 5 m be place in the holder then the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the entrance slit be see this align with the cross hair such that the image through the eyepiece be a cross shape with a vertical orange line through the middle which be the spectral emission line of the sodium vapour this indicate that the grate surface be at 45° to the axis of the collimator then the telescope be turn through 90° again so that it be in line with the axis of the collimator and the diffraction grate be turn so that it surface be normal to the axis 2 figure 2 the final setup of the grate spectrometer the problem encounter here be that the spectral line have a thickness also some difficulty be encounter when adjust the telescope position so the cross hair intersection would be in the middle of it thus this be a source of error however my lab partner and i decide that the thickness of the line be n't thick enough for the error to not be negligible the spectral line have a thickness because energy level be n't infinitely sharp due to hyperfine splittingthe zeeman effect splitting of spectral line due to a b-field there be magnetic object around the apparatus in the room such a metal paperclip and other apparatus with magnetic metal component but their effect be very subtle a hyperfine splitting be n't observe in addition the negligible error be justified also because the temperature in the room be quite standard and do n't affect the hydrogen gas to the extent that we could n't ignore it so thermal doppler broadening do n't affect our subsequent measurement either 2 5 after the setup we interpret the spectral line in the eyepiece to be the central maximum of the diffraction pattern because the telescope be align with the axis of the collimator ideally the central maximum should have zero angular displacement from the axis of the collimator and the slit image in the eyepiece be the closest to the central maximum with almost zero angular displacement from the central maximum 2 iii.ii determine the rydberg constant after set up the spectrometer to take accurate measurement of angular displacement of spectral emission line the sodium lamp be replace with the hydrogen lamp during the course of the experiment although we be told that the lamp should be turn off every 10 minute for about 15-20 minute it be kept on for the entirety of the experiment a it be advise that instead the lamp should be turn off when the spectral line start flicker which do n't happen when align with the principal axis of the collimator the scale on the spectrometer read 80.40 ± 0.05° and this angle be decide to be the reference angle for the n th order maximum 0.05° 3 minute of arc be decide to be the absolute uncertainty for each angle measurement for the follow reason  decide where the measurement mark line up be quite difficult because the scale be small and while try to read it  i be in an awkward position because the other component of the spectrometer get in my way  we decide that get the measurement wrong by more than 3 minute of arc be highly unlikely  the room be dark and a magnify glass with a light be require to be use to read the scale and even then the scale be difficult to read  parallax error be not likely because the scale be very close together and it be test that my position when reading the scale do n't affect it o it be test by me reading the 80.4° reading from different position and a far a i could tell the measurement do n't change when look through the eyepiece the observation be that there be 3 different colour and hence 3 different wavelength of light these be red pinkish light blue almost turquoise and violet almost purple the order from the central maximum be that red be first and then light blue and then violet on both side of the central maximum we be expect to see four line because accord to the balmer series and the rydberg equation see section ii.ii we therefore believe that the 4 th spectral line be too close to the ultraviolet region for u to see or just in that region equation 1 be for monochromatic light and there be 3 different wavelength show so the result for n and θ be collect separately for each colour and 3 different table and graph be plot for each colour in order to take measurement for each wavelength the telescope start out at the central maximum and then be turn until the cross hair intersection align with the middle of the nth order spectral line this be do on both side of the principal maximum and go up to n 3. it could n't go far because the intensity become too low especially for the violet wavelength where we could n't take measurement for n 3 on both side due to that reason in addition the spectrometer be set up next to a wall so the telescope be n't able to go far on one side of the principal maximum only because the wall be block it apart from the uncertainty in the angular displacement of the maximum there be n't any other uncertainty for any other quantity in equation 1. from the 3 graph the gradient multiply by d give 3 different wavelength the long for red and the shortest for violet these result be then use in equation 3 with n 3 for red n 4 for light blue and n 5 for violet for the red and light blue wavelength 6 reading of θ be take in total go up to n 3 for each side for the violet wavelength only 4 reading be take up to n 2. hence the uncertainty in r ∞ calculate from violet light be expect to be large than the other two graph 1 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for red light the graph for red light see graph 1 be compute by python to have the equation 5 the gradient of the graph be multiply by d to give the wavelength of the red light which turn out to be 659.33 ± 7.03 nm see equation 2 graph 2 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for light blue light in the same way for light blue light see graph 2 the equation of the graph be 6 hence by use the same method a for the red light see equation 2 the wavelength of the light blue spectral line be determine to be 491.33 ± 6.20 nm graph 3 the linear relationship between n and sin θ for violet light for violet light python compute the equation of the graph to be 7 the result wavelength be 433.66 ± 13.40 nm the absolute uncertainty for violet light be great than the uncertainty for red and light blue light a expect because it have two less reading in addition the error bar be show to be visibly large for violet light a show by compare graph 1 2 and 3. the error on the wavelength σ be calculate use the follow method where σ be the absolute uncertainty in the gradient compute by python use σ θ 3 minute of arc use these wavelength and equation 3 the rydberg constant determine from each wavelength be the follow  for red light r ∞ 10 920 176.54 ± 116 545.04 m -1 the uncertainty here be 1.07  for light blue light r ∞ 10 854 890.47 ± 136 975.80 m -1 the uncertainty here be 1.26  for violet light r ∞ 10 988 733.21 ± 339 386.68 m -1 the uncertainty here be 3.09 about 3 time the uncertainty for blue and red which be expect a mention before therefore the final value of the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10 921 266.74 ± 197 635.84 m -1 the result uncertainty be calculate to be 1.81 use equation 4 the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10 980 368.06 m -1 and this theoretical result be within the experimental result 's range the difference between the theoretical and the experimental value be determine to be 0.54 to summarise in this experiment i set up a grate spectrometer in order to take accurate measurement of the angular displacement of n th order maximum from the 0 th order maximum i do this for 3 different wavelength which be 3 spectral line correspond to 3 different electron transition to energy level 2 in hydrogen use my data i determine my experimental value of the rydberg constant and compare it to the value of r ∞ i calculate use equation 4 use know value see appendix 2 one improvement on my experimental method would be to repeat the measurement i make a i only record one measurement for each wavelength and for each order then i would 've be able to improve the precision of my result and hence the error bar on graph 1 2 and 3 would 've be small i would 've be able to achieve well overall accuracy in the experiment a possible source of error that

grate spectrometer setup fig 2 it can be see that clamp be use to hold the diffraction grate which could 've bent it and therefore affected the result other factor which i could 've take into account to improve my result be thing such a spectrometer misalignment because even after try to align the spectrometer the slit image in the eyepiece be n't completely vertical air pressure might also affect the hydrogen atom in the hydrogen discharge lamp in addition the rydberg formula itself which be a result of the bohr model of hydrogen be n't completely accurate and have it limitation the bohr model

to observe and measure the angle of maximum for balmer series photon emit from a hydrogen lamp graph be use to find the wavelength of the different light in the balmer series and these wavelength be plot use the rydberg equation to find the rydberg constant t his experiment be conduct to accurately determine the rydberg constant which be one of the most accurately measure physical constant 1 the rydberg constant first appear a an empirical constant in the rydberg formula 1 when johannes rydberg generalise the balmer equation found by johann balmer to transition between any two energy level in hydrogen niels bohr later demonstrate that the rydberg constant could be calculate use more fundamental constant by adopt the bohr model a see in equation 4 5 the rydberg constant be thus strongly related to the fine structure constant which be in turn related to the fundamental probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon 2 and so be of extreme theoretical importance previously the rydberg constant be experimentally determine via the spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen a proton and an electron a in this experiment however in a more recent experiment the lamb shift of muonic hydrogen a proton and negative muon be measure use pulse laser spectroscopy which suggest the accepted value of the rydberg constant should be change by almost 5 standard deviation 3 the current codata accepted value of the rydberg constant be r ∞ 10973731.568508 ± 0.000065 m −1 4 this mean that the rydberg constant be know with an extremely low percentage uncertainty of less than 6 × 10 −10 i n a gas-discharge hydrogen lamp the electric field cause some atom near the anode to positively ionise free electron the free electron then move to the anode the cation proton form by the ionisation be now attract to the cathode and so be accelerate eventually they collide with a neutral atom which transfer electron to the cation when the electron be transfer it fall from high energy level to low one in the hydrogen atom thus emit a photon to conserve energy a it potential energy decrease note these lamp be fundamentally different to incandescent lamp where a whole nearly continuous spectrum of light be emit the wavelength λ of the photon emit in the hydrogen gas-discharge lamp be give by the equation 1 originally posit by johannes rydberg where p be the initial principle quantum number and q be the final principle quantum number thus the rydberg constant may be found if λ p and q be know the rydberg constant can be interpret a the high wavenumber of a photon possible emit from an electron decrease it energy level in hydrogen by take p 1 and q ∞ the light from the lamp may be pas through a lens to collimate the light before be disperse by a diffraction grate if we assume the grate slit width be small compare with the wavelength we can assume the light will diffract uniformly this allows each slit to act a a secondary source the light from each secondary source will then interfere with light from other secondary source in this case an interference pattern will be produce in which the angle θ at which each order maximum appear be give by equation 2 where n be the order of the maximum and d be the slit space 5 use a diffraction grate reduces the intensity of the light between the maximum and so increase the resolve power of the apparatus the point where line of light appear in the pattern be point where the phase shift between light from each secondary source or slit be very close to 0. wavelength observable by the human eye lie in the range 390nm to 700nm the balmer series be the set of spectral line for hydrogen emission when an electron transfer from an energy level p 2 to q 2. the balmer series be show in figure 1. a subset of the balmer series h α h β h γ and h δ lie in the visible range and these be the wavelength that be measure during the experiment the balmer series be particularly useful in astronomy a hydrogen be the most common element in the universe the doppler shift of a star 's balmer series will indicate it radial velocity and the relative intensity of each member of the series will indicate the temperature the balmer series wavelength may be found use equation 1 set p 2 and let q 3 4 5 .... ∞ the balmer series tends to a wavelength of 346.6nm at q ∞ the resolve power ∆λ of the grate spectrometer be give by equation 3 where n be the number of slit ∆λ be a measure of whether two similar wavelength be distinguishable by use the bohr model which place electron orbit in progressively large circle centre on a small massive positive nucleus the rydberg constant may be derive in term of fundamental constant where m e be the electron rest mass e be the elementary charge 0 be the permittivity of free space h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light in a vacuum once the rydberg constant be found it can be use to determine the fine-structure constant α use equation 5 the fine structure constant can be interpret in vary different way the most basic be perhaps the ratio of the potential energy of two electron a distance d apart and the energy of a photon with wavelength 2πd the fine structure constant be use in perturbative quantum electrodynamics calculation f irst the grate spectrometer a show in figure 2 be calibrate use a sodium gas-discharge lamp the eyepiece be focus on the cross-wire and the camera focus on a distant object 20m the slit width be set to a small a possible for accurate calibration the telescope be then align with the collimator axis the grate be then set at 45 • and the telescope rotate 90 • allow the grate height to be properly set when the grate and telescope be then rotate back to their 0 • position the grate ruling be checked to lie along the axis of rotation of the telescope a the interference pattern be still in the plane of the telescope the cross-wire be rotate so that it form an x rather than a '+ shape allow for well precision and accuracy when the telescope be aim at a line the grate with the high number of slit be use a this increase the resolve power and therefore the accuracy and precision of measurement the grate use have 300 line per mm which give d 3.3 × 10 −6 m. once calibrate the sodium lamp be replace by a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp the telescope be rotate slowly and each colour line the colour and the angle change from the 0 • line be record use the vernier scale this be repeat for the `` negative `` order line in order to acquire more data and negate small effect of incorrect calibration this process be repeat 3 time and the mean take for each colour 's order line data be collect for order line between −3 and 3 inclusive the line for h δ be too dim to be observe in the experiment the data be take quickly a the hydrogen lamp quickly heat up too much and the probability of the require transition occur decrease cause the visible line in the interference pattern to dim a dark room be use in order to well see the interference line and therefore increase precision the high order line e.g n 3 be dimmer and therefore it be necessary to increase the width of the collimator slit to allow more light from the lamp to enter the apparatus and therefore increase the intensity of the line t he graph for each colour 's d sin θ against n be show in figure 3. this graph be plot base on equation 2 each data point be the mean of the three repeat take the uncertainty in the y-axis be found use the standard error formula give in the lab manual 8 base on equation 2 where σ y be the y-axis error and σ θ be the error in θ which by consider the vernier scale and the possibility of incorrect calibration be determine to be σ θ 0.05 • this value for uncertainty be chosen base on the resolution for the vernier scale be 1 60 • and consider the error for calibrate the spectrometer however it may be a slight overestimate give how exactly the line fit the point in the σ y calculation the uncertainty in the grate space d be assume to be negligible σ d 0 a diffraction grate be manufacture extremely well the x-axis error be also assume to be negligible σ x 0 a it be easy to check which order line the light appear at the gradient of this graph for each data set give the wavelength of the emit light a show in the table to reduce uncertainty for wavelength more repeat and a large range of order line could be use the high order line take be 3 a the line be become too dim to accurately measure the position of if a brighter hydrogen lamp be use then this problem would be negate use these wavelength value along with p 2 and q 3 4 5 figure 4 be plot where the gradient give the rydberg constant here we have assume that the visible wavelength will be emit by electron fall from the third fourth and fifth energy level to the second the gradient found from this graph be r ∞ 1.080 × 10 7 m −1 three point be generally consider insufficient for statistically analysis however these be the only three wavelength both in the visible spectrum and intense enough to be easily observe the error in wavelength be found use a covalence matrix of each set of data in figure 3 and then the error in inverse found again use the standard error equation 7. it be clear from the graph that the uncertainty in the purple point be relatively large indicate that θ for the dim purple line be occasionally measure and confuse with the brighter purple line this be also evident when the measure purple wavelength be compare with the accepted value for balmer series wavelength the uncertainty for r ∞ be calculate by take the root mean square error between each value predict by the fit line and the measure data point this value be found to be σ r∞ 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 this equates to a percentage uncertainty of 1.67 therefore the final value of the rydberg constant be r ∞ 1.080 ± 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 it would be possible to decrease uncertainty in the wavelength and therefore r ∞ by take more repeat to drive down statistical uncertainty another possibility be to use a vernier scale with even high resolution although the resolution be already very good o verall the experiment be very successful the initial goal of calculate the rydberg constant be achieve with extremely low uncertainty of 1.67 largely due to the use of the vernier scale and diffraction grate the value of the rydberg constant that we found be r ∞ 1.080 ± 0.018 × 10 7 m −1 which be very close to and within our uncertainty of the codata accepted value of r ∞ 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 if the experiment be to be repeat a darker room and brighter hydrogen lamp could be use in order to improve the visibility of the line and thereby increase precision if we be able to detect other wavelength of light far more wavelength could be plot on figure 4 and different other emission series use thereby reduce the uncertainty in the value of r ∞ and give a more accurate value,extended,bal

in order to measure these wavelength a gatig spectrometer be use the rydberg constant r ∞ m −1 be use in spectroscopy to determine the wavelength of light emit when electron move between the shell of an atom for example a hydrogen atom it be first determine by johannes rydberg in 1890 through investigation of the emission spectrum of alkali metal 1 it be beneficial to measure the value of this constant precisely a it can be express in term of several other more fundamental constant a where α be the fine structure constant dimensionless m e the electron mass kg c the speed of light m/s and h plank 's constant kg m 2 s −1 and due to this relation strict confines on the value of r ∞ can be use to restrict the value of these other harder-to-measure constant we chose to measure this constant to this end though it be unsure whether our result will have any significance due to the high level of precision already present in other measurement of this constant 4 a grate spectrometer deflects beam of light through diffraction a diffraction grate a piece of transparent material wit several thinly space parallel line drawn upon it act a a series of slit be at the heart of the spectrometer this grate deflects each beam a different angle θ dependent on it 's wavelength equation 3 and cause each beam to split into several which periodically repeat with different value of θ. these

can be show to be equal to where ∆l be the difference in length of the path each ray take hence and ∆l mλ a ∆l can also be define a where θ be the angle between the normal and the maximum be consider it can be show that in this case m be define a the order of the consider beam thus by measure the gradient of a plot of sin θ against m a value for λ could be found the grate spectrometer be set up so that the position of an undeflected beam of order 0 be measure a θ 0. this setup be perform use a sodium lamp a the spectrometer 's source a the hydrogen lamp could not be left on for extend period of time the hydrogen lamp be then put into place and the measurement make each measurement be make through the initial identification of a beam through scan with the eyepiece detailed adjustment of the position of the eyepiece be then make until the identify beam be center in the eyepiece 's crosshairs the position be then checked by another party before the position be lock then the hydrogen lamp be switch off and the scale of the spectrometer read twice and the result record the colour of the beam a observe through the eyepiece be also record a a rudimentary measure to identify repeat beam of the same wavelength then the lamp be switch back on and the process repeat this process a repeat until all observe beam be account for table 1 2 and 3 show the result obtain from the experiment figure 2 show a plot of these result the error in these result be due to myself and my partner lack of confidence in our 2. ability to precisely read the vernier scale of the spectrometer a well a the size of the division on this scale thus the error be the same for each result use these value we plot a graph of sin θ against m for each colour of beam figure 2 from this plot and equation 7 we be able to determine value for the wavelength of each colour beam and use those value to estimate r ∞ the result of these calculation be show in table 4. the value we chose for p and n be base on consideration of the know emission line of hydrogen and estimation of which line we be observe inform by data within source 2 these estimate be then average to produce our final value for r ∞ the true value of r ∞ be know to be r ∞ 1.097 373 156 850 8 × 10 8 ± 5.9 × 10 −12 3 our value be accurate to this one with a 0.21 difference with a percentage error of 0.27 our large source of error in our measurement be the value calculate from the purple beam which may be due to the fact that they be fainter than the other beam and so harder to accurately measure the position of in this experiment we aim to determine the rydberg constant with a high degree of accuracy the value we found be within 0.2 of the know value which consider the time and material constraint upon this experiment we believe to satisfy our aim this error could have be reduce by the provision of some kind of aid in find the position of spectral line perhaps a more luminous hydrogen lamp or by use a sensitive camera connect to a computer enable a quantitative judgment of the position of each line this would 've enable the fainter purple spectral line to be more precisely locate and perhaps allow the take of measurement of

green light we realize that green light should be the blue light and the orange light should be ignore during the measurement we found that it be very difficult to tell the reading on the vernier

the grate spectrometer can be use to determine a precise and accurate value of the rydberg constant which this report will detail the rydberg constant relates the discrete wavelength of light that can be emit from an excite atom to the correspond energy level the atom have transition between these wavelength be discrete because the energy level to which the atom can transition to be quantise i.e they take specific value this be outline in section ii we use a hydrogen lamp a a source of excite hydrogen atom and shone the light through the spectrometer to produce the hydrogen emission spectrum the angle each spectral line make with the central maximum be measure and thus the wavelength be determine for each colour of light the spectrometer be utilised because it be capable of precise measurement with a potential minimum uncertainty of three part in ten thousand this be because it u a vernier scale which be accurate to 1 arcminute this allows for precise alignment when set up the spectrometer far detailed in section iii and also precise measurement a a result we be able to reduce the uncertainty in our value to 0.22 which be small when white light pas through a diffraction grate an interference pattern be produce where a series of repeat rainbow continuous spectrum be observe 1 the angle that each order maximum make with the zeroth order maximum be dependent on the wavelength of the light hence the series of continuous spectrum i.e the 'breaking up of the light because the light emit by the hydrogen lamp be compose of discrete wavelength the spectrum observe will have line instead of a continuum we use the spectrometer to measure the aforementioned angle and then equation 1 be use to calculate the correspond wavelength 2 where m be the m th order maximum λ be the wavelength in metre d be adjacent slit space in the grate in metre and sin θ be the sine of the angle from the central maximum each order be observe when a hydrogen atom be excite it electron

atom be transition from n ≥ 3 to n 2. red light be observe when n 3 blue when n 4 and violet when n 5. there be several important component in the spectrometer namely the slit and collimator diffraction grate and the telescope a see in figure 1. the latter two be both move fig 1 a schematic diagram of the grate spectrometer show the main component the light source be a hydrogen lamp and the diffraction grate be 300 line mm −1 5 part whose movement can be finely adjust and measure relative to a rotate angular vernier scale it design allows for these part to be fully fix in position or to be move a require in the alignment process the spectrometer utilises a vernier scale precise to 1 arcminute or 1 60 th of a degree the light passing through the collimator must be at normal incidence to the diffraction grate therefore the alignment of the diffraction grate and telescope be vital to take precise measurement the telescope and eyepiece instrument have a crosshair which be use a a reference point to align the telescope with the centre of each spectral line the crosshair therefore have to be in focus when view an image to do this careful adjustment of the eyepiece be make furthermore the telescope must be focus such that a clear image of the spectrum be visible this be achieve by focus the telescope such that a distant object be clearly visible to precisely align the move part firstly the telescope be align such that an image of the central maximum be in line with the crosshair thus ensure the light be enter the telescope at 180 ± 1 20 ° by fix one part of the vernier scale the telescope be rotate through 90 ± 1 60 ° this angle be measure by note the initial reading on the vernier scale and move to a position 90 ± 1 60 °clockwise from this the diffraction grate holder be then rotate to a position such that a reflect image be at normal incidence to the telescope i.e 45 ± 1 20 ° to the light exit the collimator whilst the telescope be fix the grate be rotate back through 45± 1 60 ° so it be at normal incidence to the light exit the collimator this alignment be measure in the same way a the telescope finally the grate be fix in this position and the telescope be unfixed allow it to move to make the reading all error on these value will be justified in section iv after the spectrometer be correctly align the 300 line mm −1 diffraction grate be place into it holder a 300 line mm −1 be use a oppose to one with few line e.g the 80 line mm −1 also available because it produce a large angle of diffraction thus reduce the percentage error on each angle measurement a narrow slit be use to reduce the width of each spectral line and the collimator to straighten the beam meaning the whole beam be at normal incidence to the grate the telescope be then move into a position where the crosshair be align with the centre of the central maximum the width of the central maximum n 0 be measure to account for the uncertainty on this measurement this process be repeat for each observe colour measure the angle the n th order maximum occur for red and blue 3 ≥ n ≥ -3 and for violet 2 ≥ n ≥ -2 along with the width of each spectral line measure in arcminute because visual interpretation have an effect on view the spectral line two measurement be make for each order to reduce this uncertainty the experiment be perform in a darken room such that there be no effect on the measurement from background light which would otherwise reduce the clarity of the spectral pattern when take measurement we identify three main source of contribute error these be glare and parallax when take measurement on the metal vernier scale uncertainty when align the crosshair with the middle of each spectral line and uncertainty a a result of visual interpretation the precision of the vernier scale would usually be ± 1 120 ° because it small increment be 1 60 ° however because of the low-light condition a magnify glass and torch be use to read the scale the glare of this light on the metal make the scale difficult to read the size of the magnify glass meant that it be too big for the spectrometer meaning measurement use the vernier scale be take at a distance and at an angle to the scale to account for this we have use an increase uncertainty of ± 1 60 ° the width of the central maximum be measure to be 1 20 ° hence the large error bar for m 0 in figure 2 and the width of every other spectral line be 1 60 ° a mention in the method section we take two set of reading for every measurement to account for the error associate with visual interpretation these reading be average and the error be fig 2 a python graph show sin θ against m for each observe wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum iii therefore σ/ √ 2 where σ be the standard deviation therefore the aforementioned error regard the parallax width of the spectral line and standard deviation of the mean be add in quadrature for each measurement of θ. thereafter the error on sin θ be calculate and subsequently plot a error bar on figure 2. to reduce the effect background light would have on the clarity of the spectrum the room be fully black out with the exception of desk lamp this therefore reduce the uncertainty associate with visual interpretation by make the observe spectrum clearer however high order spectral line be still less distinct i.e when m ≥ ±2 this be down to an issue with our setup where despite our best effort not all of the light from the lamp be passing into the collimator this cause light to enter the telescope when it be at large angle from the normal of the grate subsequently reduce the clarity of the spectrum at these high order furthermore use the accepted value of the rydberg constant and set n 6 the resultant wavelength be within the visible range with a wavelength ∼ 410 nm however this be not observe in our spectrum this be most likely due to the issue i have just outline in conjunction with the inconvenience that some group have desk lamp turn on whilst we be take measurement the red and blue spectral line be the clearest and the violet line be only see when m ≤ ±2 this suggests that this error affected small wavelength hence the overall absence of the light correspond to n 6 and m ±3 for n 5. our value for the rydberg constant be 1.1025×10 7 ± 2.5×10 4 m −1 figure 3 show value of the wavelength calculate use data obtain from figure 2 and equation 1. the correspond value of the rydberg constant be calculate from equation 3 use these wavelength the uncertainty on the wavelength be the error on the gradient in figure 2 divide by d. the uncertainty on the rydberg constant be calculate from equation 3 use the aforementioned error the overall uncertainty on our value of r ∞ be the three error add in quadrature the percentage error for our value be 0.22 which be small thus demonstrate the overall precision of our experiment the accepted value of r ∞ be 10,973,731.6 m −1 this be just below the low bound for our value which be 11,000,000 m −1 although it be close to this low bound be ∼ 26,000 m −1 below it this therefore mean that our experiment do not produce an accurate value this be likely due to a systematic error the value of the wavelength correspond to n 3 4 5 calculate use the accepted value of r ∞ and equation 3 our value be all small this therefore explains why our value for r ∞ be big than the accepted value because equation 3 u λ −1 i believe the systematic error have most likely be cause by damage to the diffraction grate cause it to have a small slit space this would produce small value of λ from equation 1. the percentage difference between the value be 0.57 0.52 0.44 respectively the error on these percentage be negligible these value be similar which show that it be a systematic error rather than a random one the purpose of this experiment be to determine an accurate and precise value for the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer our value be 1.1025×10 7 ± 2.5×10 4 m −1 this mean we be successful in determine a precise value because the percentage error for our value be low at 0.22 however we be unsuccessful in determine an accurate one a more precise value could 've be obtain by use a spectrometer with a high degree of precision along with a clearer scale e.g a digital one to reduce glare furthermore by take more measurement in addition have the hydrogen lamp be design in a well way such to reduce it aperture and the experiment have be conduct in isolation the effect of background light would have be nil lastly the diffraction grate use should 've be checked for damage or a brand new one should 've be use to avoid any chance of damage nullify the systematic error this have on our experiment",deep,the
30,GS_YUK005_Redacted,in this experiment we use spectrometry technique to find the value of the rydberg constant we first set up our spectrometer and we measure the spectrum of hydrogen by passing the light of a hydrogen lamb through a diffraction grate we then measure the scatter angle of some visible light then we could deduce the wavelength of these light with the formula for interference with diffraction grate and use the equation for transition wavelength in hydrogen to obtain 𝑹 ∞ 𝟏𝟎𝟖𝟏𝟒𝟎𝟎𝟎 ± 𝟓𝟏𝟎𝟎𝟎𝒎 −𝟏 his report discus an experiment to obtain a value for the rydberg constant the rydberg constant relates energy level change of an electron in a hydrogen atom to the wavelength of the light emit a there be certain energy level in the hydrogen atom the hydrogen atom can only emit electromagnetic radiation of certain wavelength thus the rydberg constant can relate energy emit and energy level change in a hydrogen atom in this experiment we be only investigate electromagnetic radiation that be within the visible spectrum for a hydrogen atom the visible light emit will be in the balmer series which will simplify the whole experiment a show in the theory part in this experiment we determine wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emit from the hydrogen lamb by passing them through a diffraction grate thus idea about interference through a grate need to be consider at bright fringe of a wavelength of electromagnetic radiation the phase difference be always an integer multiple of 2𝜋 while at a dark fringe the phase difference be always odd integer multiple of 𝜋. assume the view distance of the observer be large enough the ray will be parallel and we can deduce that the path difference between 2 ray ∆𝑙 ∆𝑙 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 from diagram 1 below where d be the slit separation and 𝜃 be the angle of the 2 ray from the horizontal phase difference ∆𝜑 be related to path difference ∆𝑙 a suggest by the equation below where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation with the above equation we could deduce that the angle at which bright fringe appear be give by 𝑛𝜆 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 eq 2 where d be the slit separation we could use this equation to deduce the wavelength of visible light from the hydrogen lamb a hydrogen atom can only emit electromagnetic radiation of certain wavelength due to the fix energy level for electron in the atom wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation be determine by the transition of the electron between these energy level the transition wavelength be give by the formula below where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 𝜆 be the transition wavelength n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level in this experiment we be only observe the light within the visible spectrum and this reduces the difficulty to distinguish what electron jump correspond to which light a visible light be in the balmer series and this series correspond to wavelength cause by electron jump find the rydberg constant with spectroscopy t 2 from nth energy level to the second energy level p=2 we start off by set up the spectrometer a the diagram 2. we focus the camera lens onto a distant object without use grate and view it at the eyepiece to check there be no parallax between the image and the cross wire a parallax will cause huge error in our measurement we then use a sodium lamp instead of hydrogen a our light source because the hydrogen lamp may die if it open for a long period we then find the angle at where the central maximum be find this angle simplify the experiment a we can use the angle difference between the nth maximum and the central maximum to determine the wavelength use equation 2 we use the spectrometer set up a diagram 2 to measure angle where bright fringe appear for visible light 1 and 2. for both color we take the angle at center of the bright fringe a the measurement and this cause uncertainty a it be impossible to determine the exact location of the center for each fringe we use the 78.8 line per mm grate in this experiment a it produce pattern with reasonable separation between fringe and high number of fringe across the 180 degree view angle we measure from -3th order to 2th order for each color a more data will reduce the random error of the result to reduce the error far me and my lab partner measure these angle independently with the location of bright fringe of color 1 and 2 we can plot sin∆𝜃 against n where ∆𝜃 be the angle difference between the angle measure and the angle where central maximum be and n be the order a sin∆𝜃 and n follow a linear relationship the slope of the graph will be 𝜆 𝑑 we could obtain the value of 𝜆 by measure the slope of the graph we can use the value of 𝜆 in equation 3 a we already know p=2 for visible light and we assign value of n to color 1 and 2 by the method of trial and error we know we will find the correct value for n when the two value of 𝑅 ∞ calculate from the n value of color 1 and 2 be similar and close to the accepted value 10973731.6. with the correct value of n we could obtain the value of the rydberg constant by rearrange ∆𝜃 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒 n order ∆𝜃 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒 -3 6.17 -2 4.17 -1 2.17 0 0.17 1 -1.83 2 -3.83 the reference angle at the 0 th order bright fringe be 172°10′ ± 0.2° we could obtain the value of ∆𝜗 by the follow equation where 𝜃 be the measurement from the spectrometer and 𝜃 𝑅𝐸𝐹 be the reference angle at the 0 th order bright fringe we estimate the random error of the measurement by take measurement independently between lab partner and we find that there be around 0.2° difference for every measurement we make we think this error arise from the fact that it be impossible to locate the center of the bright fringe accurately a some of the fringe have low intensity and they be blur this uncertainty propagates to ∆𝜃 all ∆𝜃 measurement will have a 0.4° uncertainty with the table above we plot sin∆𝜃 against n a show below in this graph the slope will be − 𝜆 𝑑 a i assign positive 𝑠𝑖𝑛∆𝜃 value for negative n. we can rearrange and obtain value for 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 use some computational line fitting technique we can obtain the follow value for 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 where 𝜆 1 =663±1 nm and 𝜆 2 442 ± 1 nm we can then deduce the value for the rydberg constant use equation 3 a we have make observation on two visible light we can reduce the random error for the result of rydberg constant by take the average of value derive from the two wavelength 𝑅 ∞ 10810000±50000 𝑚 −1 a we know 𝑅 ∞ only depend on wavelength when n be fix from equation 3 we could work out that the follow relationship with this equation we could obtain ℴ 𝑅 ∞ =50000 the aim of this experiment be to find the rydberg constant in this experiment we use a spectrometer with a grate to determine the wavelength of light emit from a hydrogen lamb and we work out the rydberg constant use equation 3 i think we have obtain some reasonably good measurement in this experiment which lead to a very close result to the accepted value however we spend too much time refining our data and we lack the time to estimate systematic error of the experiment such a misalignment of the spectrometer and lamp position etc i think we could improve this experiment by make more estimation about systematic error after this experiment i become more experienced at use the spectrometer and gain more insight about how spectroscopy can be use in different field of physic,deep,bal
31,GS_BQD756_Redacted,can be consider accurate furthermore a the percentage uncertainty be very low 0.432 we can also say that there be a relatively high precision by this method the rydberg constant r∞ be hugely important in atomic physic and help to relate transition wavelength λt to the energy level which the electron have transition from with the equation where n and p be integer which represent the initial and final state of the atom when the rydberg constant be first establish it be do so empirically in order to make sense of the rydberg equation when apply to a hydrogen spectrum however it have since be show that it can be calculate from more fundamental constant far validate the value this feature be also why the rydberg be so useful it be one of the most precisely know constant so it be very useful when utilized in equation 1 for instance use the rydberg equation transition wavelength can be determine with a very low uncertainty to get such a precise value i have use a grate spectrometer a spectrometer essentially creates a collimate beam of light which be then disperse use a 78.8 mm -1 diffraction grate the spectrum can then be observe use an eyepiece and angle can be record through a vernier scale a long a the spectrometer be correctly calibrate i would hope to achieve very precise result to do this i will have to take measure to reduce the uncertainty of human judgement in part of the method this will be achieve by repeat reading from two or more people or by incorporate digital equipment into the method e.g camera to read vernier scale ii theory spectroscopy be the study and analysis of a spectrum of light the grate spectrometer i have use u the phenomenon of diffraction to separate the collimate light beam into it spectrum this occurs a the individual wavelength of light which sum together to form the beam diffract by different amount the angle of diffraction θ can be link to the wavelength λ by the equation where n be the order of the maximum and d be the space between each slit in the diffraction grate we use a slit space of 1.269x10 -5 m a this produce good spectral pattern for analysis maximum appear during diffraction due to the superposition of wave front at a maximum the path difference between the two wave must be an integer number of wavelength determine the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer blackett laboratory imperial college london sw7 2bw uk a previously mention and show by equation 1 the rydberg constant demonstrates the wavelength of the photon which be emitted/absorbed when there be a change in energy within the atom this due to the discrete energy level which exist within an atom and be explain use the bohr model of the atom figure 1 show some of the more common transition within the hydrogen atom the balmer series in hydrogen be the transition which result in visible photon wavelength contrastingly the lyman series exist in the ultraviolet range and the paschen series in the infrared range bohr also help to show the rydberg constant can not just be found empirically but can also be express use fundamental constant by where α be the fine structure constant me be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be planck 's constant 4 by substitute in the equation for the fine structure constant we have an even more fundamental equation with where e be the charge of an electron and εo be the permittivity of free space iii method to carry out precise measurement it be imperative that the grate spectrometer be correctly calibrate the spectrometer must be in focus and free of parallax so we focus the eyepiece onto the cross hair which be in the middle of the telescope and we could then focus the camera lens onto an image at approximately ten metre away so that the parallel light ray would be in focus when they pa through the camera lens at this point it be important that the lamp be ready to be use and must be place a closely to the slit a possible whilst be completely on view to the slit this be so that the only light come through the eyepiece be from the lamp with the maximum intensity available we ensure the camera collimator and eyepiece be parallel and we change the focus of the collimator so that the slit gap be in focus in the eyepiece from this point it be important that we do not change the focus on any part of the spectrometer a we would then have to repeat the entire process we then place the diffraction grate in to it holder make sure we do not touch the surface and that it be completely vertical we use 78.8mm -1 diffraction grate with this value be determine by the manufacturer from this point we rotate the telescope 90° secure in into position with a screw and proceed to rotate the grate until the entrance of the slit be reflect into the eyepiece approximately 45° we do not need to adjust the height of the image a it be in a good position however we could have do this by use the plate screw if require we record the angle on the vernier scale and continued to rotate the grate through exactly 45° so that the plate be at a 0° incidence we be now happy that the spectrometer be calibrate however we move the telescope around to observe some of the spectral line to confirm that they be be show and be vertical when calibrate correctly and with enough repeat the spectrometer will produce uncertainty of approximately ±0.2nm in order to reduce the effect of human judgement increase this uncertainty we place the camera from a smart phone in a set position to take picture of the vernier scale when an angle need to be measure this reduces uncertainty a it stop the error in reading from an arcminute scale the uncertainty from reading off the scale be reduce from ±1/12° to approximately ±1/120° a sodium lamp be use to collect some preliminary data during the prelimina1y investigation the optimal size of the slit space be dete1mined which would remain constant throughout the experiment and we also decide that the 78.smm-1 be the grate which produce the clearest pattern so that would also remain constant throughout the experiment we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp and begin to record data a see from the balmer series there be 4 main transition which result in visible photon and we will observe 3 transition and take angle measurement for each we be observe red blue and purple band for each colour band we observe the zero order and record the next two maximum on the positive and negative side we would record the order with it correspond angle from the vernier scale when take these reading there be an uncertainty in the width of the band that you be observe to minimize this unce1iainty we each take a reading from both edge of the band and take an average to get a well estimate of where the centre of the band be to finiher decrease the unce1iainty we then take take an average of our own individual measurement use equation 2 we could plot a graph of sin0 a a function of the order of the maximum in this case 0 be the angle from the zero-order maximum this give u a precise estimate of the wavelength of each transition we then use equation 1 to plot the transition wavelength against the transition energy level to detennine the rydberg constant when take measurement for 0 it be very imp01iant that there be no background source of light so the experiment be canied out in a blacked-out room with small desk lamp background light could interfere with the spectrum and reduce the intensity of the spectrum in the eyepiece this would increase the unce1iainty in our measurement other factor which must also remain constant be the humidity and air pressure in the environment ignore negligible fluctuation these be involunta1ily kept constant moreover during the experiment we encounter an issue with the hydrogen lamp they can only be use for time span of around fifteen minute before they overheat and stop work we have one hydrogen lamp break when we be near the end of the experiment despite be the same model from the same manufacturer we still expect to have different result from the new lamp this could be take a a major source of error to dete1mine the rydberg constant we first have to have accurate estimate of the transition wavelength of the emission band we be observe from figure 3 you can see that each band follow a linear relationship which pas through the origin the gradient at each point be equivalent to the transmission wavelength divide by the slit space use this data we compute the wavelength of each band the wavelength of the red band be 622.6 ± 0.7 nm the blue band be 493.3 ± 0.6 nm and the purple band have a wavelength of 444.0 ± 0.9 mn when compru ed to the balmer series these wavelength agree with the actual transition wavelength so they can be consider accurnte the main enors that arose in the wavelength be the enors from measure the diffraction angle of each band which manifest itself in the value of sin0 the calibration of the spectrnmeter be a cause of systematic error even tl1ough the spectrometer be calibrate carefully it be largely do by eye so we can expect a small yet non-negligible constant enor throughout the result i estimate this to be approximately ±0.3nm another major source of systematic euor be the change of the hydrogen lamp midway through our experiment a previously mention the model be the same however they can not be expect to perf01m in the same way i take this to be a systematic enor which be only prevalent in the data record after the change from when the lamp change the relationship still seem to follow a consistent b'end with no real sign of fluctuation fmthe1more a the lamp be the same model and be manufacture at a similar time i have take tl1e e1rnr to be negligible random enors have also be consider despite reading from a camera there be still random enor in reading from the vernier scale i approximate this to be ±0.18nm by observe the small change of angle which could be dete1mined and use equation 2 to check the change in wavelength additionally background source of light do become a sligl1t issue and we do find slight drop in intensity at point which create more unce1iainty when take reading when this occuned we ensmed that the background light be remove and we remeasured the value to get an eitor from a measurement of wavelength we add the eitors in quadrature to get a set eitor of ±0.35nm for every measurement this then have to be add in quadrature to the enor which occmted due to the width of the band of light this be the individual main somce of eitor and it account on average to 50 of each eitor on the wavelength on figme 3 there be no euor bar show a they be so small that they affected the clarity of the data point therefore i remove them we then analyse the wavelength of the emission band use equation 1 the gradient of the graph show in figme 3 be equal to the rydberg constant use the gradient and tl1e eitors which have be estimate practically the value of the rydberg constant be 1094599 ± 15872 m• 1 this show a percentage uncertainty of 0.145 and a percentage euor from the actual rydberg constant 10973739.6m-1 of 0.253 this mean that the actual value of the rydberg constant do not lie in the range of nnceitainty these enors be somced from the e1rnrs in the reciprocal of the wavelength a there be no eitors in the x direction on figme 3. the e1tors here be equivalent to the percentage enors from dete1mining the wavelength for confumation i analyse the graph in figure 3 statistically use a co-variance matrix function which can be found in the scipy module in python this result in a rydberg constant of 1094599 ± 47287 m• 1 from tlus there be now a 0.432 uncertainty so the actual value do now lie in the range of unce1iainty this show that the statistical variation be indeed great than the practical unceitainties that i estimate so i chose to use the statistical unce1tainty in my final value due to this we can say that the experiment be more accurate than initially thought a the expect value be in the coitect range from my experimental value contrnstingly the experiment be not a precise a initially calculate because the percentage uncertainty do in fact increase when statistical method be use this be cause by the random enor in estimate the centre of the enussion band because it be accountable for over 50 of the total enor when the wavelength be compute it be the large source of eitor so it have the most affect when add in quadratm•e v. conclusion the goal of the experiment be to determine a precise and accurate measurement of the rydberg constant we be observe the spectrum from a hydrogen lamp to identify and analyse the balmer series to compute the rydberg constant from it a grate spectrometer be use to diffract the collimate light beam and the angle of diffraction of the maximum be analyse my final value of the rydberg constant be 1094599 ± 47287 m -1 which result in a 0.253 error from the true value with our equipment and skill level i believe we make an accurate and very precise measurement of the rydberg constant this be due to the percentage uncertainty and our error be very small consider human judgement be require in the experiment you can usually rely on human error be in the 2-3 area 5 at least whereas our error be 10 time small than this expect value due to this our value can be consider accurate in order to improve this experiment i would consider a more modern approach to the grate spectrometer a spectrometer which can be programmed to optimise itself in term of grate type and slit size and can identify where maximum exactly lie this would virtually remove all random error from the method make the experimental value much more precise,expert,bal
32,GS_SRW902_Redacted,the wavelength of visible light emit from the balmer series of hydrogen can be use to determine the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and a transmission diffraction grate of

a much a possible a measurement of r ∞ to within less than 0.5 be comfortably achievable with this spectrometer in 1913 niels bohr postulate that an electron can move in stable approximately circular orbit without emit radiation or lose energy 4 the energy of a photon e photon a radiation light be emit be give by where e i and e f denote the initial and final energy of the photon a it emits radiation and fall to a low energy level the final energy level that the photon fall to determines what spectral series be observe during this experiment the wavelength of light due to electron transition in hydrogen atom be measure from a high energy level to the second level n 2 if each energy level be label n 1 n 2 n 3 and so on then the electron transition for a hydrogen atom be call the lyman series 5 n 1 the balmer series 6 n 2 the paschen series 6 n 3 and the brackett series 7 n 4 these transition be show in fig 1 transition to high energy level have also be observe though the spectral line become fainter a the likelihood of a transition to an energy level great than n 6 be quite uncommon electron transition in the balmer series that fall to n 2 emit radiation in the visible spectrum use a hydrogen lamp and the spectrometer the wavelength of light emit from the lamp be determine a equation 2 state the energy of a photon emit from an electron during it transition between two energy level be the difference in energy between those two level if we compare the relative mass of a proton 8 m proton 1.67 × 10 −27 kg to that of an electron 9 m e 9.11×10 −31 kg then it a reasonable assumption that m proton m e the mass of a proton be ≈ 1840 time that of an electron use this assumption and bohr 's postulate we can equate the electrical force f e and the centripetal force f c act on an electron where 0 be the permittivity of free space r n be the orbital radius around the n th shell and v n be the speed of the electron 's orbit all in si unit all other symbol carry the same meaning a define in equation 1 these two force can be equate since the electron and proton have opposite charge with the electron orbit the proton and the assumption that no other force act the radius of the electron 's orbit and it speed be give by and respectively bohr far postulate that 'the angular momentum of the electron round the nucleus in a stationary state of the system be equal to an entire multiple of a universal value independent of the charge on the nucleus 4 in fig 2 the electron can be see in yellow emit radiation a it transition from n 3 to n 2 this be a balmer series spectral line and occurs in the visible spectrum bohr go on to show that the angular momentum of an electron be a quantise integer multiple of h 2π 4 we can therefore write where n ∈ z now rewrite the expression for r n and v n a and equate to equation 4 and 5 respectively we find that and for a hydrogen atom in it ground state the most likely position of the electron occurs at n 1. this be know a the bohr radius r bohr 10 apply the principle of conservation of energy allows the sum of the kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p to be write a a constant e t conservation of

planck-einstein relation 11 that the energy of an emit photon of light be related to it frequency by where h be the planck constant equation 15 can be rearrange 12 to where r ∞ m e e 4 8 0 2 ch 3 m −1 19 to determine a value for the rydberg constant the wavelength of light along with it uncertainty be measure during the experiment electron transition of the balmer series be observe in particular transition from n 3 to n 2 and from n 4 to n 2 use equation 18 and the value of r ∞ quote in the laboratory manual 13 r ∞ 10 973 731.6m −1 wavelength of λ red 656nm and λ blue 486nm should correspond to these two transition respectively these wavelength value be calculate use the currently accepted value of r ∞ so that the two colour of light red and blue be know before start the experimental work when a wave of wavelength λ pas through a small slit the wave be diffract and spread out in a circular path if there be multiple slit of separation distance d such a on a diffraction grate then lot of circular wavefront be form a the wave diffracts through numerous slit these wavefront interfere result in constructive and destructive interference for constructive interference two wave must superpose at a maximum so they be in-phase the path difference between two adjacent slit be λ and so a righttriangle can be construct a in fig 3 such that due to the sinusoidal nature of wave successive minimum and maximum will occur a the wavefront progress maximum be observe for any integer number of λ though the intensity of successive maximum will decrease a the diffraction increase we find therefore that where m ∈ z and be call the order number a student pasco model sp-9268 spectrometer 2 be use to calculate the wavelength of red and blue light emit from a hydrogen lamp a excite electron transition from n 4 and n 3 to the second energy level n 2 equation 21 be use to measure the angle θ at which maximum be observe for order number m ±1 ±2 and ±3 far order number be not

calculate by where d the number of slit per unit length be know value of r ∞ with their associate error be then calculate from equation 18 ensure that the telescope be clearly focus so that well define line of interference could be observe the hydrogen lamp be place near the collimator slit the width of the slit be adjust until the red and blue line be clearly visible and focus the direction of travel of the light be show by black arrow in fig 4 a transmission diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre be use to cause diffraction of the light and for the wavelength to be measure 21 allows for the wavelength to then be calculate adapt from 11 a label set-up of the apparatus use in the experiment be show in fig 5 the telescope be firstly focus on a distant object at the other side of the laboratory minor adjustment to the lens be make to ensure that it be exactly in focus use the focus knob on the top of the telescope for the initial set-up of the apparatus a sodium lamp be use to align the lens this be to eliminate the risk of the hydrogen lamp overheat the sodium lamp be place very close to the collimator slit and the power supply be switch on the telescope be point at the slit and a sharp focus image of the light be observe the angle of rotation of the telescope be note from the vernier scale at this point it be then rotate through 90 • a mirror be place in the grate holder and the grate table be rotate through 45 • so that the slit be reflect and visible from the telescope 's eyepiece the telescope be then return to it original position and a diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre be insert into the grate holder at this point well define blue and red slit could be see through the eyepiece to improve the accuracy of measurement fig 5 a label image of the experimental set up most part of the spectrometer be visible on the image though a few can not be see the slit adjustment be locate to the left of the collimator focus knob and be use to narrow or widen the slit of light from the lamp at the end of the telescope not visible be the eyepiece with cross-hair alignment the cross-hairs can be rotate and be position in such a way to produce an x shape a oppose to a '+ on the underside of the telescope be an adjustment knob use to make small alteration to the focus of the telescope when reading numerical value from the vernier scale a hand held magnify glass be use to reduce the likelihood of misread the scale occasionally use the magnify glass be not very effective if for example the table rotation handle align exactly over the vernier scale in such situation a mobile phone camera be use to capture the scale at an appropriate zoom to reduce the possibility of random error one person take all the reading from the vernier scale whilst the other control the alignment of the telescope a parallax error also have to be consider when take reading from the vernier scale this error be minimise by position the magnify glass/mobile phone directly above the scale and take reading from this position the resolution of the vernier scale on this grate spectrometer be 1arcminute and so an error of ±1arcminute when reading the scale be reasonable it would not be justified to claim an error of ±0.5arcminutes due to the parallax error which can not entirely be ignore when rotate the telescope to the position of each spectral emission line the physical thickness of these line have to be consider since each diffract beam have a physical width over which the wavelength of light remains the same the beam be measure in two place the angle of rotation of the telescope for each spectral line be measure on the left side and the right side of the beam denote by θ lef t and θ right respectively the cross in fig 6 show where the telescope be align to take these reading the error associate with the width of each beam be add in quadrature to the error from reading the vernier scale the error for the width of the fig 6 a graphic of a diffract beam of blue light be observe through the telescope the telescope 's angle of rotation be record at the two x 's and the mean of the two value take reading of θ lef t and θ right have an uncertainty of ±1arcminute though the width of the beam be significantly large than this beam be give by and varied for each beam the variation be likely due to the increase faintness of high order beam and the uncontrollable background light due to other group in the laboratory in general the width of the beam appear to increase a the order number increase in magnitude this be likely due to the great diffraction and decrease in intensity of the light where more background light be present the beam become more difficult to accurately observe this be reflect in the individual error associate with each of the beam also notable be the large width error for the measurement of blue light compare to red for almost all the measurement the blue beam appear fainter and with more fade edge make the exact position of θ lef t and θ right harder to decipher fig 7 show the variation in beam width for red and blue light for order number −2 ≤ m ≤ 2. these value be all much great than the ±1arcminute error due to reading the vernier scale and so dominate when add in quadrature there be little correlation in the data though the error for blue light be consistently high than that for red light except for one reading when plot sin θ against m to determine the wavelength of the red and blue light the mean value be use this method be use to determine the position of each beam since align the cross-hairs with the centre of the slit be much more subjective and introduces a great random error place the cross-hair exactly on the boundary of the slit result in less random error and tell u the width of the beam when the angle at both side be measure fig 7 a graph of the width of the diffract red and blue beam use a diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre colour accordingly over five order number from equation 21 a plot of sin θ against order number m will yield a straight line of gradient λ d two diffraction grate be available during this experiment one with 80 line per millimetre the other with 300 line per millimetre preliminary experimental data show that use the grate with 300 line per millimetre be much more beneficial for this experiment the sharpness and clarity of the diffract beam increase a the number of slit per unit length increase this meant that it be easy to align the telescope with the left and right side of each beam since the side be more define the space between each beam be on average ≈ 9 • when use the 300line grate compare to ≈ 22 • apart for the 80-line grate a consequence of this space be the number of diffract beam that could be observe beam of order m 2 be not at all visible when the 80-line grate be use however when use the 300-line grate third order beam be visible for red light a θ widtherror of around 25arcminutes be measure for the beam when use the 80-line grate during the experiment only the 300-line grate be use to produce the diffract beam this kept the θ widtherror to a minimum and allow for the maximum number of diffract beam to be observe and their position measure 21 and contains error bar for the angle measure at each diffract beam there be no error along the horizontal axis since the order number be unambiguous and could clearly be count from start at the zeroth order beam the zeroth order beam be identify a be a different colour to all the other beam it position be such that the red and blue light appear in the same place and so a purple colour beam be see error along the vertical axis be dependent upon the vary error θ widtherror define by equation 23 a well a the constant error of ±1arcminute due to take reading from the vernier scale the red line of the graph represent the plot of red light and the blue line represent blue light a red diffract beam of order m −3 could be observe through the telescope though blue light of this order could not be the intensity of the red diffract beam appear great than that of the blue light and perhaps explains why red light of this order could be see but blue not though this be purely speculative fig 8 a graph of sin θ against order number m for red and blue light use a diffraction grate of 300 line per millimetre the red line represent the data collect from measurement of red light and the blue line represent the blue light data the dimensionless gradient of the red line be 0.195 ± 0.002 and the gradient of the blue line be 0.16 ± 0.02. from the gradient of the two line show in fig 8 the wavelength of red and blue light be calculate use equation 22 where d 1 3×10 5 m they be found to be λ red 650 ± 7nm and λ blue 530 ± 70nm the large error in λ blue be predominantly due to the uncertainty in the width of the diffract beam and be previously discus in detail use equation 18 two value of the rydberg constant can be calculate use the value and uncertainty of λ red and λ blue these be r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 use the measure wavelength of red light and r ∞ 1.0 ± 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 use the wavelength of blue light these value vary from the accepted value of r ∞ by 1.1 and 9.7 respectively a show in fig 8 the relative error due to the width of each beam be much large than the ±1arcminute error due to reading the vernier scale this be the main cause of uncertainty during the experiment spectrometer misalignment could have introduce a systematic error into the experiment though the risk of this be greatly reduce by practise the alignment multiple time before take measurement the spectrometer be set-up in a well-lit room on a sturdy grate table show in fig 5 the likelihood of misalignment be low so it be a reasonable assumption to treat this error a negligible in comparison to other source a significant source of error that be reflect in the error bar of fig 8 be the position of the hydrogen lamp the lamp be position a close to the collimator slit a possible to ensure that the great intensity of light could be observe through the telescope during preliminary test the lamp be place at a distance 20 ± 1 cm away from the collimator slit and the diffract beam observe the beam be noticeably fainter and their boundary not a well define this result in a much large θ widtherror and so the lamp be place a close to the collimator slit a possible during the experiment for measurement of the blue diffract beam the θ widtherror be generally large than the measurement for red light this may be due to the position of the lamp since it be move between reading of the red and blue diffract beam it be possible that the hydrogen lamp be place slightly off centre and so the boundary of the beam for the blue light be less well define this possible mispositioning could also explain why no third order blue beam could be see since the intensity of light able to pa through the collimator slit be less this systematic error affect the uncertainty in the telescope 's angle θ when measure each of the beam and so be account for in the vertical error bar of fig 8 consider the average difference in the error θ widtherror for the red and blue light the mispositioning of the lamp likely increase the error in the blue light data by ≈ 6arcminutes due to the mispositioning the distance of the hydrogen lamp from the collimator slit be great for the measurement of the blue light compare to red when the hydrogen lamp be place away from the collimator slit not only light from the lamp enters through the slit background light played a part in the uncertainty of the boundary of each of the beam and so this source of error be amplify by the mispositioning of the lamp when measure the blue wavelength during the experiment the laboratory light be switch off though desk light be turn on this result in some light pollution to minimise the effect of this background light the spectrometer and lamp be cover by a coat when reading be be take although this eliminate most of the background light not all of it be block since the result of the background light be an increase uncertainty in the exact boundary of the diffract beam this error be again reflect in the vertical error bar of fig 8 and account for an error of ≈ 4arcminutes for all the reading though inevitably varies for each reading defocus of the telescope could have introduce a small systematic error in the measurement a previously mention the spectrometer be set-up multiple time before data be collect and the telescope focus onto a small blue box at the other side of the laboratory since the image of the beam remain the same clarity throughout the experiment it be a reasonable assumption to treat this systematic error a negligible consider the relative uncertainty of the experimental value for the rydberg constant a weight average of the two can be establish the value of r ∞ calculate from λ red have an error ten time small that than of the value calculate from λ blue use this weight we find r ∞ 10 1.11×10 7 +1.0×10 7 11 ± 10 0.01×10 7 +0.1×10 7 which yield a final weight value of the constant r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 this result lie 0.24 from the accepted value and encompasses the accepted value within the error give measure the wavelength of red and blue light from their emission line in the balmer series from a hydrogen lamp allow for two value of the rydberg constant to be calculate these be r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 use the measure wavelength of red light and r ∞ 1.0 ± 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 use the wavelength of blue light the value lie either side of the accepted value and combine give a weight experimental average of the rydberg constant a r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 effective use of the student pasco model sp-9268 spectrometer to measure the wavelength of light enable a final value of the rydberg constant to be calculate to within 0.24 of the accepted value careful consideration of error and their propagation be crucial in ensure that an accurate result could be calculate the technique use to minimise error such a practise the set-up and alignment of the spectrometer cover the apparatus to block out background light and position the hydrogen lamp such that the intensity of the diffract beam be a large a possible be successful in keep the error relativity low poor experimental technique when measure the wavelength of blue light lead to a large random error the misalignment of the hydrogen lamp and collimator slit result in an increase in background light and consequently a decrease in intensity of the diffract beam both consequently increase the overall uncertainty in the width of each beam and so the error be large to improve on the experimental technique use in this experiment more data should be take across a range of diffraction grate with more data the apparent background noise may be able to be separate and potentially completely remove from the error in the reading diffraction grate with slit space 300 line per millimetre may allow for high order beam to be observe and hence the uncertainty of the gradient

focus the telescope to a distance object make sure the x see through the telescope be very clear set up the hydrogen lamp and adjust the collimator so the x be on focus to the center of the strip of

34,GS_MJV182_Redacted,this investigation involve the determination of rydberg 's constant by mean of use a grate spectrometer to measure the angular displacement of diffract spectral line from a hydrogen lamp first calculate the wavelength of these spectral line and then use the value of these wavelength to calculate value for the rydberg constant the determination by this method produce the accurate result of 1.10±0.04 ×10 7 m −1 1.09± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 thus it be conclude that the set of data from the red diffract spectral line produce the data with the least amount of experimental uncertainty when an electromagnetic emission be diffract whether it be from distant star or a sodium lamp the various wavelength of the emission be diffract at different angle this therefore produce a spectrum of all the wavelength present in the emission where the spectrum will be 'continuous for a solid emitter such a heat metal filament -containing a continuum of wavelength of vary intensity however in the case of electron in heat or electrically excite gas the excitement and follow relaxation of the electron between the discrete energy level of the gas atom cause the spectrum to contain only specific wavelength -those that relate to the size of the discrete energy gap that the electron transition over this be give by λ hc e where λ be the wavelength h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light and e be size of the discrete energy gap these be call 'emission line spectrum from the spectral pattern they produce when examine use a spectrometer a spectrometer produce this spectrum by collimate a thin sliver of light from the source use either a lens or mirror and then passing the re-sulting beam through either a grate to diffract it or a prism to refract it each wavelength in the beam will diffract or refract at a different angle thus produce a spectrum spectroscopy have be use for analysis in chemistry physic and astronomy all the way since the early 19th century when joseph von fraunhofer first use a diffraction grate to produce a spectrum of the sun 's visible light which appear a a continuous spectrum with thin dark gap in certain area these be later determine to be certain element in the sun 's corona absorb discrete wavelength of the sun 's radiation to excite their electron to high energy level thus reduce the intensity of the sun 's light at these wavelength -i.e the dark gap this investigation u a grate spectrometer the same concept a that originally developed by fraunhofer to measure the wavelength of spectral line in the balmer series emit by a hydrogen lamp these can then be use to deduce the rydberg constant a fundamental constant which relates the the spectral line of an emission spectrum to their wavelength niels bohr in his hypothesis for the model of an atom define the rydberg constant r ∞ in term of various fundamental physical constant where m e be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light h be planck 's constant and α be the fine structure constant -which be itself a combination of other fundamental constant maximum of an interference pattern occur when the phase difference between two ray be an integer multiple m of 2π the phase difference can also be express a the path difference of the two ray multiply by 2π λ where λ be the wavelength of the interfere ray 1 and since the path difference be just the slit separation d multiply by sinθ where θ be the angle of diffraction thus eliminate 2π here it can be see that sinθ be directly proportionate to m call the order number thus by measure the angle that the maximum appear at and know the slit separation of the diffraction grate the wavelength of the refract light can be determine the rydberg formula relates the transition wavelength λ of hydrogen to the integer n and p which represent the discrete energy level of the excite and relaxed state of the atom respectively the balmer series refers to the series of electron transition from an excite energy state of n 3 4 5 • • • ∞ to a relaxed state of p 2. the rydberg constant can then be calculate use the balmer transition wavelength value determine use the grate spectrometer the follow be a diagram of the path travel by the light in the spectrometer the emission from the source be pas through a narrow slit where a collimator convert the light into a parallel beam after then passing through the grate at normal incidence part of the diffract beam can be focus through a camera onto the center of a cross-hair x shape 1. the eyepiece lens be adjust to focus on the cross hair then the camera focus on a distant object -to imitate parallel light 2. the telescope be then set to be align with the axis of the collimator 0 • of angular displacement and the hydrogen lamp position in front of the slit so a to illuminate it 3. the focus of the collimator be adjust until the image of the slit on the cross hair be a sharp a possible and the telescope position so the slit be in alignment with the center of the cross hair 4. the grate be move through precisely 90 • and the grate place in the holder the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit be visible in the eyepiece -this indicates that the grate be at an angle of 45 • with the incident beam from the lamp and the telescope 5. the telescope be rotate through 45 • back to be in parallel with the incident beam on the grate 6. the angular displacement from this point to the diffract spectral line of red light be then record a a function of their order of magnitude the same be do for the set of diffract blue and violet spectral line from the linear regression analysis of the slope in figure 2 the standard error in the gradient of the slope be 0.000225 0.0012 0.00271 for the red blue and violet spectral line respectively these along with the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate can be use to calculate the overall error in the value obtain for the rydberg constant here be an example calculation for the 'red line set of data the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate be take a ±2 a state by the manufacturer thus d slope slope 0.000225 0.0522 0.00431 6 therefore the value determine for the rydberg constant via the 'red line data be 1.10 ± 0.02 × 10 7 m −1 the same process apply to the 'blue and 'violet data set give rydberg constant value of 1.10 ± 0.04 × 10 7 m −1 1.09 ± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 these result be notably accurate the calculate error in each obtain value account for the difference between the calculate value and the real know value of 1.097 × 10 7 for the 'red set of data the error in the diffraction grate turn out to be the most significant source of uncertainty whereas for the 'blue and 'violet spectral line data the error in the slope be found to be high than the diffraction grate uncertainty these two data set have a high standard error could be due to a different hydrogen lamp be use for them a the first lamp blew while we be take data the hydrogen lamp be also move slightly during the measure of the blue line data which could have very slightly affected the path of the beam through the slit into the camera this could have be improve by use clamp to secure the lamp and spectrometer tightly to the worktop only duplicate reading be take for the angular displacement reading the precision of the data point could have be improve by increase this to at least 4 repeat measurement of the data set the three obtain value for the rydberg constant via this diffraction grate experiment be 1.10 ± 0.02 × 10 7 1.10 ± 0.04 × 10 7 and 1.09 ± 0.09 × 10 7 m −1 this method have thus be an effective mean to determine the value of the rydberg constant a the widely accepted correct value of the constant 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 lie within the range each calculate value 's error margin in order to reduce the level of uncertainty in the future the experiment should be carry out with the hydrogen lamp and grate

35,GS_HDP206_Redacted,in this paper i will present the method and result for an experiment with a grate spectrometer the purpose be to calculate a value of the rydberg constant by shin a hydrogen lamp through a grate spectrometer by measure the diffraction angle with the spectrometer the transition wavelength for hydrogen can be calculate with the wavelength and the transition level it be possible to calculate the rydberg constant and it uncertainty to get sufficient amount of statistical data we measure several transition from the balmer series from the transition 3→2 and 4→2 we get an average value for the rydberg constant 𝑹 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 a difference of 3.6 from the accepted value he motive for this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ from the balmer series for hydrogen the experimental method in the laboratory be base on a grate spectrometer use a hydrogen lamp a light source hot or electrically excite gas emit photon in which the emission be concentrate at a few well define wavelengths-called `` emission line spectrum `` our light source u hydrogen gas which by an electrical current through the gas excites photon at specific wavelength four of these wavelength be in the visible spectrum and can be measure with the spectrometer this device u a lens to produce a collimate beam of light make of several distinct wavelength which be disperse with a grate and split into it component wavelength with each separate wavelength head in different direction determine by the relationship the disperse light beam be then focus and view with an eyepiece in this way the various wavelength can be determine by measure the angle at which the light beam be disperse the balmer series for hydrogen represent a series of energy level for orbital electron when an electron make a transition from an initial state of high energy to a state of low energy the atom emits a photon of energy if we know the energy level and the correspond wavelength the rydberg constant can be calculate a diagram of the grate spectrometer use in this experiment be show in figure 1. the grate behaves like a multi-slit aperture with many closely space slit with a separation between adjacent slit of d. the light beam be diffract by the grate at an angle θ thus for neighbour light beam the path difference be d sin θ a show in the inset in fig 1 the light beam will interfere constructively only if the path difference be an integer number of wavelength where m be call the order number the ray from all slit will interfere constructively at the angle where m be an integer produce a principal maximum in that direction transition wavelength for hydrogen be give by the rydberg formula where n and p be integer which represent the energy level of the initial and final state for transition in the atom respectively 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant which have the accepted value 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 these transition be illustrate in fig 2. to set up the spectrometer we use a sodium lamp since it provide a stable light source without go warm the spectrometer use in the experiment consist of a collimator grate camera lens and eyepiece mount on a rotatable foundation a show in fig 3. the angle of the telescope camera lens and eyepiece relative to the collimator can be read with a vernier scale an illustration sketch of the spectrometer source http //spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys273/manual/diffract.html first we focus the eyepiece on the cross wire and the camera lens such that an object 10 m away be focus on the cross wire furthermore we align the telescope with the axis of the collimator with the sodium lamp close to the slit the collimator be focus on the slit to get the grate accurately parallel to the collimate beam the follow procedure be follow the telescope be rotate 90 deg and clamped in position place a grate with 78.8 line per mm in the holder turn the grate table until a reflect image of the entrance slit be see in the eyepiece with the vernier scale the grate be rotate 45 deg so that it be parallel to the collimate beam with the setup we could see 3 distinct spectral line for hydrogen with the red a the brightest light blue aqua slightly dimmer and violet not a bright since red and light blue be easy to measure accurately we focus on measure them in our experiment the slit width be measure to 0.07 deg at the 0 order for the red line we start from order -7 and move to order 5 reading the vernier scale at every order for the light blue line we measure order -9 -8 -7 0 3 4 5 and 6 since the measurement at the high order give more accurate reading and it save time the uncertainty of reading the vernier scale be estimate to 0.03 deg the data for the red emission line be show in fig 4. use the line fit we can calculate the wavelength with equation 1 obtain the wavelength 𝜆 694 ± 3 10 −9 𝑚. from the accepted value of the balmer series the transition 3→2 give red light at a wavelength 656 10 −9 𝑚. since this be the low energy level in the visible spectrum we can conclude that this be the transition we measure to calculate the rydberg constant we use our measure wavelength in equation 2 where n 3 and p 2. the result be the value 𝑅 ∞ 1.037 ± 0.014 10 7 𝑚 −1 the same procedure can be apply to the measurement of light blue aqua see fig 5 for data which yield the wavelength 𝜆 492 ± 0.2 10 −9 𝑚. from the accepted value of the balmer series the transition 4→2 give aqua light at a wavelength 486 10 −9 𝑚. this be very close to our measure value relative to the neighbour transition thus we can conclude that this be the transition we measure in the same manner the rydberg constant can be calculate but with n 4 and p 2. give the value 𝑅 ∞ 1.084 ± 0.014 10 7 𝑚 −1 combine the value we get the mean rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 with a percentage uncertainty of 1.9 the large error be from the measure value for the red emission line a potential source for this could stem from a difference in the setup since the red emission line be do in the first lab session and the aqua line in the second it be therefore possible that there be a difference in the setup such a the grate not be perfectly align for the aqua light we be able to measure order -9 and 6 which give a more accurate measurement of the wavelength furthermore there be a systematic error related to the reading of the vernier scale which have an estimate error of 0.03 deg in addition the light pollution in the laboratory mainly from other desk lamp make the reading harder another source of systematic error be the hydrogen lamp which contains small quantity of other material this effect be neglect a small since we do not see any other bright emission line the uncertainty can also be a result random error which can be reduce by take more measurement this be not do due to the long setup and time set of to the other part of the experiment the result of 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 be relative close to the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ 1.09737316 10 7 𝑚 −1 this suggests that our experiment agrees with the theory and the accepted value of the rydberg constant however there be a difference in the value and an associate uncertainty a review of the method of the experiment be therefore important in this experiment the set up have a substantial impact on how easy and accurate the measurement be we felt that our setup give well result in the second session where we measure the aqua light since we be able to see high order and get more consistent data this uncertainty could have be avoid by use the same setup but this be not possible due to time shortage in the first session on the same manner with more time we would be able to get more measurement which would reduce our random error furthermore a potential solution to minimize the systematic error be to use a ccd camera to find the principal maximum emission line and a magnetic sensor to measure the angle that the spectrometer be rotate at the aim of the experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant from the balmer series for hydrogen the experimental method be base on a grate spectrometer use a hydrogen lamp a light source through this method we obtain the result of 𝑅 ∞ 1.061 ± 0.020 10 7 𝑚 −1 and a percentage uncertainty of 1.9 compare to the accepted value of 𝑅 ∞ 1.09737316 10 7 𝑚 −1 our result be relative good at a percentage difference of 3.6 however the uncertainty of 1.9 could have be reduce by minimize our systematic error and reduce the random error by take more measurement some of the important factor with the experiment be the setup of the spectrometer and take consistently accurate measurement with the eyepiece and the vernier scale a potential solution to minimize this systematic error be to digitalize the measurement of the emission line and diffraction angle the spectrometer enables u to highly accurate measure spectrum and line of light it be widely use in science astrophysics and engineering and it find have help u explain the element of faraway object the gaseous layer of space and even the composition of the universe,superficial,bal

deduce that the red line be hα 3 to 2 and the blue line be hβ 4 to 2 a the former be more probable than the other and the remain balmer line be not intense enough to be observe a their transition be very improbable 1 use this data the rydberg constant can be calculate for each balmer line observe a grate be a large number of slit equally space separate by a distance d. light passing through a grate hence undergoes diffraction for a light of wavelength 𝜆 a principal maximum occurs when phase difference between two ray be an integral multiple n of 2π 2 in the case of 2 neighbour beam from the figure one see that the path difference be dsinө hence the spectrometer be use to measure different value sinө correspond to their respective value of n. the value of d depends on the grate use hence use the data from the spectrometer and equation a the wavelength of light can be calculate the grate constant n implies that there be n number of slit per unit length hence the distance between each slit be the inverse of the grate constant the wavelength can then be substitute into the rydberg formula state in the 'theory section and the rydberg constant can be calculate one must deduce the value of n and p for the various balmer line observe base on their relative intensity the improbability of a transition be proportional to how large the transition be hence reduce the intensity of light observe a the transition get high upon my lab partner and i take two individual reading for every fringe the maximum difference between our reading be 3 minute 0.05 degree hence error in the angle measurement be 0.05 degree the value of angle in degree be know to 4 significant digit hence all value will be write upto 4 significant digit with the error in angle ө be know we can calculate the error associate with sinө use the error propagation hence wavelength λ slope/78800  λ 6.580 × 10 -7 ± 1.049 × 10 -13 substitute into rydberg 's formula with n=2 and p=3 explain in 'theory section

through a grate spectrometer upon which the wavelength of the balmer line observe be measure use which the rydberg constant could be estimate the experiment be a success in that the calculate value of rydberg constant be inaccurate only by 0.28 but the theoretical value do not lie in the error range of the calculate value this experiment be very useful and important because it taught u to use a spectrometer which be a very important instrument and have a wide number of u in various field it be also one of the most accurate instrument in the laboratory this experiment could be improve if the telescope have a high resolve power so the crosshair can be place more accurately by reduce ambient light the slit can be small in size thereby make measurement more accurate,extended,bal
37,GS_QMC249_Redacted,the rydberg constant symbol r∞ be measure use a grate spectrometer with a hydrogen lamp use a a source the wavelength of visible light emit by the hydrogen lamp be determine use simple diffraction grate theory which allow the value for r∞ to be determine use the rydberg formula for hydrogen specifically the formula pertain to the balmer series in hydrogen this result in a value of 11050000 ± 30000 m −1 which corresponds to a fractional uncertainty of about 3 part per thousand i n this experiment a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the emission spectrum of hydrogen be due to atom transition between atomic energy level and can be broken down into distinct spectral series one of which be the balmer series the balmer series pertains to transition to the 2nd energy level from high energy level and be of interest since it also involves emission of wavelength within the visible spectrum the wavelength in the balmer series be determine by examine the diffraction of the wavelength due to the grate then by use the rydberg formula which relates the wavelength of photon emit and the energy level involve in the transition a value for the rydberg constant can therefore be obtain for a diffraction grate where m be an integer call the order number λ be the wavelength of the light passing through the grate d be the slit separation and θ be the angle between the diffract ray and the grate 's normal vector in the bohr model of the atom electron orbit a positively charge nucleus where the electron can transition between stable circular orbit of different energy call energy level an atom can radiate energy in the form of a photon by an electron transition down from one energy level with energy to another with a low energy 1 p. 1318 for hydrogen-like atom which only have one electron the transition wavelength of the photon emit be give by the rydberg formula in the case of hydrogen and the balmer series z 2 and n 1 2 so equation 2 becomes the balmer formula where n 2 have be replace with n. the rydberg constant can be express a where α be the fine structure constant m e be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be planck 's constant use this result in a predict value for r ∞ of about 10973731.6 m −1 this value can be insert into equation 3 along with select value of n where n 2 and be an integer to predict what wavelength be emit in the balmer series and their colour table 1 above show these iii experimental method the grate spectrometer be set up a show in fig 1 and calibrate with a sodium lamp a the light source and a grate with a space of 2001 line per inch a sodium lamp be use for calibration instead of a hydrogen lamp since the calibration require that the light source be switch on continuously for a period of time which would cause the hydrogen lamp to overheat have it be use after calibration the sodium lamp be switch with a hydrogen lamp when first view the emission spectrum it be observe that the visible spectral line be red aqua and blue correspond to n 3 4 and 5 respectively in the balmer series violet line correspond to n 6 be visible but extremely faint therefore it be decide to collect data on only red aqua and blue line since it be thought that attempt to collect data on the violet line would be too time consume angle measurement be take one colour at a time begin with red then aqua and lastly blue since keep the hydrogen lamp for too long would cause it to overheat we take reading in time period 15 minute long and allow it to cool for 10 minute before take more reading the grate spectrometer be mount on a vernier scale which measure angle to the near arcminute or one-sixtieth of a degree the scale be very difficult to read so a magnify glass be use to assist in this the angle at the zeroth order/central maximum be measure for red line after which the telescope the camera and eyepiece would be turn until the next red line be encounter which then would be the angle at the first order maximum this would continue until no more red line would be visible at which point the telescope would be move back to the central maximum and the same process would be carry out in the other direction this time with the angle correspond a negative order this process would also be carry out for the aqua and blue line base on equation 1 it can be see that by plot sin θ against m for line of a certain colour where θ would be the difference between the angle at central maximum and the angle at a certain order m a linear graph would be obtain where it gradient would be equal to λ d this mean that the wavelength of the light can be determine by multiply the gradient by the slit separation d. figure 2 be a plot of sin θ against order m for red aqua and blue line the gradient with their associate error of these line be 0.05197 83 0.0385 27 and 0.03422 92 respectively multiply by slit separation d of about 1.27 × 10 −5 m −1 we obtain the wavelength λ red 660 ± 1 nm λ aqua 488 ± 3 nm λ blue 434 ± 1 nm compare these wavelength to the predict value in table 1 indicate that the red line in the balmer series very likely represent the transition of an electron from n 3 the aqua line from n 4 and the violet line from n 5. would result in a linear graph with a gradient of r ∞ the rydberg constant fig 3 λ and it gradient be equal to 11050000 ± 30000 m −1 therefore we have obtain the final value with uncertainty for the rydberg constant this represent a fractional uncertainty of 3 part per thousand in comparison with the 2014 codata recommend value of 10973731.568508 65 m −1 2 our obtain value be within 0.7 percent but the recommend value do not fall within the experimental error bound this likely indicates that some source of error have not be take into account it take a long time for the grate spectrometer to be calibrate which be hamper by the spectral line gradually move below or above the line of sight of the telescope a θ increase this implies that there be a slant in some part of the grate spectrometer a a result only six reading be able to be take for each colour if more reading be take the error obtain could have be less moreover some systematic error be likely to have be introduce a a result of this misalignment another potential source for error from within the apparatus be if the grate and collimator or the camera and eyepiece be not perfectly parallel to the other this would result in deviation of the angle measure thereby contribute to the error the absolute error use for θ in the error analysis be ±1 arcminute since the vernier scale have an absolute error of ±0.5 arcminute and θ represent the difference between two reading despite this when take a reading from the vernier scale it be often difficult to decide which point on the vernier scale aligns with the main scale so the absolute error be probably underestimated the air density may be important since air can cause light to refract although over a short distance a in the spectrometer any error it contributes should be negligible in this report we examine the balmer series for hydrogen and present an experimentally obtain value for the rydberg constant which be reasonably close to the accepted value despited that the fractional uncertainty of three part per thousand be ten time the theoretical precision of three part per ten thousand for a grate spectrometer which be partly due to misalignment of the spectrometer moreover the accepted value be n't within the error bound obtain far indication that there be source of error not take into account or otherwise underestimated this experiment could be improve if the alignment of the spectrometer be improve a well a by take more reading,deep,bal
38,GS_GOO868_Redacted,through method of spectroscopy we be able to calculate a value for the rydberg constant a constant that be use when calculate the wavelength of emit light from hydrogen atom and more specifically the wavelength from the balmer series the balmer series that we measure be the photon from electron that have de-excited from a high energy level to the second energy level of a hydrogen atom a a result our procedure be to use a hydrogen source and for the light to be diffract through a grate the light from the diffraction grate be then measure and for the wavelength to be calculate from their respective angle by calculate the wavelength of the light we be able to produce a value for the rydberg constant 1.69562 × 10 6 m -1 ± 3.13799 × 10 5 m -1 the true value of the rydberg constant however be 1.0973731568508 × 10 7 m -1 1 this constant be useful when investigate the bohr model 2 for atom and so provide a great initial investigation into the structure of atom at a more fundamental level n order to calculate a value for the rydberg constant we have to use a new technique to measure the wavelength of the emit light from the hydrogen source spectroscopy furthermore through this experiment we be able to look at the behaviour of light through a diffraction grate and how the component of the light emit be able to provide detail of the source and thus the structure of hydrogen atom to complete this experiment and to understand the implication of such an experiment the theoretical background must be understood since there be an equation relate the number of slit per unit length in the diffraction grate and the wavelength of the light through the grate the different wavelength be produce at vary angle additionally since there be an equation relate wavelength and the rydberg constant these measurement that we be able to take allow for this constant to be calculate we use a spectrometer for this experiment and by use a hydrogen lamp the correct measurement be take also due to the way in which the hydrogen lamp depletes so quickly the sodium lamp be use for the initial calibration this experiment involve use a vernier scale and so it be of vital importance to measure the value accurately especially when consider some of the value be of such a small value and difference the balmer series be of great importance to research and so understand this characteristic of light from a hydrogen source have implication on research be conduct at the moment the abundance of hydrogen within the universe also make this series vitally important when it come to the classification of star and other cosmological object 3 the nature of light allows for certain prediction to be make when light interacts with an obstacle and thus due to this predictability the characteristic of a light source can be measure the grate itself be compose of equally space slit of which there be a large number n and with each slit separate by a distance d. the light then pas through each slit for it then to interfere with light from other slit within the grate the way in which light interferes with other wave involves the phase difference 𝜙 of the light during it interaction with other wave this cause superposition between the wave and thus determines at which angle there be maximum and minimum this phase difference can then be show through these equation where 𝜆 be the wavelength of light emit from the source m be the order number and 𝜃 be the angle of the light from the normal to the diffraction grate consequently with vary wavelength be emit from the transition of electron to the second energy level the angle will vary and so the different wavelength can be detect to ensure however that each line could be detect consider a second wavelength λ. a a result a relationship between the two wavelength can be show through these two equation where δ𝜆 be the difference between the two wavelength 𝜆 and λ. the condition of this value for this equation be such that δ𝜆 ≪ 𝜆. therefore from this equation it reveals how the resolution of the image be dependent upon n the number of slit in the diffraction grate a a result of these equation we be able to show that through the method of spectroscopy it be possible to observe the different wavelength of light at vary angle from the normal to the diffraction grate these different wavelength be be emit from a hydrogen atom and can be related between the initial and final energy state of the atom this be due to the way in which the great the energy transition the shorter the wavelength this relationship be from these equation and definition where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 3 n be the initial state and p be the final state with both be integer α the fine structure constant 4 𝑚 𝑒 the mass of the electron h the planck 's constant e the charger of an electron and 𝜀 0 the permittivity of free space for the balmer series that we observe the final state be the hydrogen atom 's second energy state and so the value of p would be 2 in equation 2 be the x-axis from this the gradient can be calculate therefore to calculate a value for the rydberg constant it would be to calculate the gradient of the line produce from our data and thereby determine a value for the rydberg constant in order to complete this experiment the setup of the spectrometer must be complete so a to ensure that all the measurement take be accurate in addition due to the extreme sensitivity of the experiment and the small value that we dealt with the setup of this experiment be vital to the success of the experiment for this experiment it be important to get a many data point a possible so a to ensure that the value we end with be reliable and accurate also due to the way in which our setup be design the hydrogen lamp have a limited amount of usage to overcome this problem a sodium lamp be use to calibrate and setup the spectrometer due to the way in which the calibration only require the zeroth order from the diffraction grate which be the same regardless of the source use so a to focus the eyepiece that we use we focus the eyepiece on the cross wire this guaranteed that each measurement we take be from a precise point that could be see clearly by ourselves if it be to be a blur image of the cross wire it would be difficult to determine from which point we take the measurement and if we be n't able to take the measurement from the same point of the strip it would make each measurement unfairly measure when compare to the other measurement we take to then focus the lens of the eye piece we align the telescope of the spectrometer onto a distant object approximately 5 to 10 metre from the telescope this allows for a clear image to be see when measure the spectral line however such focus allows for a minimal parallax between the spectral line that we be measure and the cross wire within the telescope follow the previous process we have to ensure that the collimator within the spectrometer have be properly focus a a result by put the sodium lamp in front of slit and the telescope align with single spectral line produce since there 's no grate the collimator lens should be focus to make the image of the spectral line a clear and sharp image this allows for clear measurement of the spectral line to be take due to the ability of the cross wire to precisely line up with the centre of the spectral line to ensure that the spectrometer be setup correctly it be vital to ensure that certain screw of the spectrometer be left alone and thus make it easy for accurate measurement to be take and for the spectrometer to be secure in place 5 for the set up of the spectrometer we record the initial value of the telescope 's angle when with no grate a single spectral line be see and we then move the telescope through by 90 degree we then place the grate into the holder on the grate table and move the table round until we could see the reflection of the spectral line in the eyepiece of the telescope we then adjust the height of the table to allow for the whole spectral line to be see fully the value of the angle at this point be then record and we then move the grate table back through 45 degree for it to then be normal to the incident ray on the diffraction grate the spectrometer we use can be see in the image below 6 after use the sodium lamp for the calibration we use the hydrogen lamp so a to collect the appropriate data from the balmer series we also kept move the hydrogen lamp 's position in front of the slit to try and allow for a much light a possible thus make it easy for u to collect reading when collect the data we try to eliminate a much background light a possible to ensure that we be not see incorrect reading furthermore due to similar experiment with similar setup be conduct within close proximity of our own experiment we decide to ensure that we block each light with black card this be important because since the telescope would move round to detect the image 3.1 this be a photo of the spectrometer use in this experiment and a can be see at the centre of the image the grate table that held the grate table be place the screw underneath the grate table control the height of the table however a screw behind the telescope the right side 's eyepiece telescope allows for small movement to be take the slow motion drive the screw either side of each telescope focus the lens of their respective telescope and the screw underneath the telescope keep the scale in place spectral line it become important to block these other source of light that may have come into view for this experiment we measure the angle from the centre of the spectral line for each colour and we continued to move through the order until the intensity of the light be too dark to be able to determine it colour however it be important to try and measure a many different colour and consequently wavelength a possible from this the aim be to try and produce a more accurate gradient and then from this a well value for the rydberg constant furthermore after align the telescope but before we take our reading we have to turn off the hydrogen lamp to guarantee the lamp would n't deplete and thus allow for more reading to be take during our laboratory session the specific setup that we use to measure the order of the different wavelength can be see in the diagram below and use this setup a spectrometer can be use so a to collect accurate data for the experiment the data that we collect for each colour can be see in the figure below and with each of these data point have an associate error that be carry through in the final calculation we repeat measurement for the aqua because it appear at the time that we have carry out our measurement incorrectly the true value can be show below 7 from this data it show that the blue data we collect be inaccurate in term of it closeness to the actual value despite the error be extremely large this be due to the diagram 3.1 this be the diagram of the experimental setup that we use the first lens the ray interact with be from the collimator with the blue dot line act a the diffraction grate the second lens then act a the camera with the third eyepiece belonging to the eye piece from this setup we be able to measure the angle of the light from the diffraction grate error be small in term of each initial measurement however when carry through in term of the error of the end result a large error be produce this disparity may have be a a result of inaccurate measurement because when measure the angle we may have misalign the cross wire over the line and so incorrect measurement in addition since we complete these measurement in a separate session the calibration of the spectrometer may have be incorrect and thus cause the disparity between the value on the other hand the data we collect for the red and aqua spectral line be near real value and hence accurate measurement since the real value fell within the error of each data set the rydberg constant can therefore be calculate and be show in the graph below however when look at the graph it be clear to see that there be an anomaly the furthest left data point it be know that this be the anomalous data point because the line need to have a negative gradient this far emphasis the inaccuracy of the blue spectral line data and the need to have collect more data however more importantly to have the spectrometer correctly calibrate this be evident because if the anomalous data be remove the gradient would change and from this a value for the rydberg constant be found 𝑅 ∞ 9.891682 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 ± 3.69817 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 and this value be much closer to the real value and although it do not have the real value within the error bar it be significantly closer to the real value a a result have more data set for other wavelength would have produce a more accurate value of the rydberg constant the aim of this experiment be to gain a value for the rydberg constant which be achieve however unless you remove the anomaly from the data we collect an inaccurate value be produce additionally due to two data point have much well accuracy and precision it reveals how when conduct the second set of experiment for the blue spectral line the spectrometer be setup incorrectly this experiment also provide u with the ability to use and understand this new technique of spectroscopy this be important because it also provide the platform to conduct far experiment in the future when conduct far experiment in other area of physic the theory of this experiment give the background to this experiment and thus allow for certain measurement to be take to allow for characteristic of a hydrogen atom to be measure and understood this balmer series be still important to modern research and so to understand it origin be important the success of this experiment be limited however because due to the inaccuracy and disparity of some of the data point the rydberg constant 's value come out to be inaccurate in comparison to the desire value nonetheless if these data point be remove an accurate result would be found the failure of this experiment be in these inaccurate data point and so to improve certain step can be take to improve accuracy for example the error could have be calculate by measure either side of the spectral line and so the error be half the range of these two value and then the standard error be calculate from all the value we measure in addition we could have take more repeat thereby produce more reliable data and thus make it easy to find the correct value a darker environment could have be make and hence reduce disturbance from the background however the main improvement would be to have spent more time on the setup of the spectrometer this improvement guarantee that there be more accuracy for each data point a well a precision because it reduces the possibility of there be an original offset that then make all value measure incorrect this experiment allow u to achieve certain goal in term of data collection and accuracy however from this experiment we be able to see the way in which the rydberg constant relates to physical attribute in the hydrogen atom and a a result learn more about the bohr model of the atom and the implication this have within the structure of an atom,superficial,the
39,GS_DAR896_Redacted,the follow paper explores how an optical diffraction-grating spectrometer which investigate visible spectral line of the hydrogen balmer series be use to determine rydberg 's constant use the precise set-up equipment reliable measurement of spectral line for several order of diffraction be obtain both red and blue spectral line be independently measure and investigate to estimate a value of rydberg 's constant these value be then compare with the accepted theoretical value from quantum mechanic graphical and computational analysis be then use to determine the estimate value for rydberg 's constant the observe red and blue spectral line produce a value of 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 respectively when compare to the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 the respective percentage error produce for rydberg 's constant be 0.38 and 2.67 the importance of investigate the hydrogen balmer series and subsequently determine the rydberg constant to high precision be most relevant in astronomy this be partly because hydrogen be the most abundant element in the universe 1 thus when study celestial body such a star measurement can then be use to identify that specific hydrogen process such a that cause the hydrogen balmer series be take place the importance of this experiment therefore stem from be able to well understand sub-atomic process which we observe and use every day in physic the various spectrum which have be observe be what lead to the study of atomic physic and quantum mechanic 1 the experimental value obtain in this experiment can therefore be compare with the accepted theoretical value for rydberg 's constant hence this could check the validity of the accepted value and be use to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the experimental procedure hence this could lead to a method of find way to improve the accuracy and resolution obtain when take astronomical reading the various series create be due to emission and absorption process in atom which create sequence such a the balmer and lyman series in hydrogen these series result from electron in the hydrogen atom transition from high state of quantum number to stable quantum state n 2 and n 1 respectively 1 due to spontaneous emission these transition reduce the electron energy by discreate amount which cause monoenergetic photon to be emit with discreate wavelength the underlie physic process take place in this experiment be the emission of monoenergetic packet of light due to orbital electron transition which follow the hydrogen balmer series and diffraction here a hydrogen lamp act a the light source and a diffraction grate spectrometer be then use to diffract the light use these instrument the monochromatic wavelength of light emit in the hydrogen balmer series for different electron transition be found this allow u to estimate a value for the rydberg constant use the rydberg equation the hydrogen lamp emits light by heating the hydrogen gas 2 which cause hydrogen atom to become excite a an orbital electron transition to a high quantum state consequently the electron shortly spontaneously emits back to the original stable quantum state during this electronic transition a light photon of monochromatic wavelength be emit because of the transition between monoenergetic level use a spectrometer to determine rydberg 's constant by investigate the hydrogen balmer series these light wave of single wavelength then diffract through a diffraction grate to create an inte1ference pattern on a screen due to the superposition of diffract light wave the theo1y of these process be described far in section ii the rest of this repo1t will describe fuither the experimental and theoretical method use to detennine rydberg 's constant and then draw conclusion from those find the discreate energy of a photon spontaneously emit by a hydrogen atom in the balmer series be give by where his planck 's constant and f be the frequency of the photon emit in the balmer series this energy be lose by the hydrogen atom a an orbital electron in an excite quantum state spontaneously de-excites to quantum state n 2. thus the energy of the monoenergetic photon emit be equal to the energy difference between the two quantum state where e1 be the initial energy of the hydrogen atom and ei be the final energy the monochromatic wavelength of light emit by the hydrogen atom in the balmer series give by 3 where c be the speed of light in a vacuum can be found by equate i and 2 to obtain .. he/ ei-ei 4 balmer also developed a fo1mula in 1885 to measure the wavelength .. of the balmer series where n be integer 1 2 3 ... and c be the balmer constant rydberg generalize this in 1889 for the entire emission spectrnm of hydrogen a where r be the rydberg constant nf be the final quantum state and ni be the initial quantum state where nf= 2 for the hydrogen balmer series l when the monochromatic wavelength light wave reach the diffraction grate the interference pattern produce contain spectral line maximum position from where the wave constrnctively superpose and inte1fere the phase difference between

ingle wavelength emit in the hydrogen balmer series for red ni 3 and blue ni 4 light then equation 6 be use to dete1mine the estimate value for rydberg 's constant the experimental method use be able to significantly reduce many systematic and random enors effect on the experiment which be obse1ved this result in obtain a precise and accurate methodology which be a reproducible and reliable method for estimate rydberg 's constant accurate technique include computational analysis be then use to obtain the estimate value for rydberg 's constant and their associate e1rnrs the diffraction grate space be dete1mined use the provide number of line per unit length from the manufacturer 2 this info1mation give an approximate value of 12.7 x 10-0 m for the slit separation a similar slit separation be need for this experiment to obse1ve many order of diffraction since the range of wavelength for electro-magnetic wave in the visible light region be approximately 390 nm -700 nm a pasco student spectrometer such a in figure 1 be use to diffract the monoenergetic light emit by the hydrogen lamp and to obse1ve the spectral emission line produce eyepiece 3 to show how a spectrometer work when light be incident on it from the slit and how it can be use to find the wavelength of the light 2 a show in figure 2 the spectrometer which be use have a collimator and slit which cause the incoming light photon from the hydrogen lamp to become a parallel beam then the grate be use to diffract accord to 7 the n01mal incidence beam into an interference pattern of spectral line which be finally focus and obse1ved a an image in the telescope which be compose of the camera and eyepiece 2 the spectrometer be set-up follow the instruction provide in the 'first year laborato1y manual 2017 -2018 2 key point in the methodology be a follow • we focus the eyepiece on the crosswire so that an image roughly 30 cm away could be optimally obse1ved with limited eye strain this reduce random enor a the specti•al line obse1ved be more well define through the eyepiece • then the camera lens be focus on a distant object roughly 10 m away where incoming light could be assume to be parallel so that there be no parallax enor between the cross wire and image this reduce the random e1rnr due to human obse1vation associate significantly • then we align the collimator and telescope turn on and place the hydrogen lamp in an optimal position to the collimator slit then focus the collimator to see the slit image more sharply • after we move the telescope through 90 degree and inse1t ed the grate into the holder this meant the collimator and eyepiece be pe1pendicular then turn the grate table until there be an image of the slit in the eyepiece this meant that the grate table be at 45 degree to the incident beam from the collimator this be because the incident light be be reflect off the grate • at this point in the set-up there be a significant systematic enor with the specti•ometer which may have be due to the manufacturer it be notice that the vernier scale reading do n't match the theoretically expect value by roughly a 10-degree offset this could n't be resolve but didn t have a bearing on the result obtain • finally the grate be position pe1pendicular to the incident light from the collimator which be align with the telescope this be do by rotate the grate by 45 degree a centi•al zero order fringe be see through the telescope when it be align with the collimator which indicate the spectrometer be align properly the vernier scale be use to accurately measure the angle of diffraction which the telescope obse1ved at maximum position at least 5 order of diffraction left and 1ight of the centi•al zeroth order fringe be use beyond which the line specti•a become less visible and bluned to dete1mine the angle of diffraction the measure angle at each order of diffraction be subti•acted from the measure angle at the centi•al fringe 8 where 0m be the angle measure by the vernier scale at each respective order of diffraction and 0c be the angle measure by the vernier scale at the centi•al zeroth order fringe this provide the necessary measurement need to dete1mine the wavelength of light emit from the hydrogen balmer series which be investigate use equation 7 and consequently estimate the value ofrydberg 's constant use equation 6 the effect of background light on the clru•ity of the spectral line obse1ved in the telescope be a systematic enor which be reduce in the experiment .. this be achieve by make the environment a dark a possible with baniers use to stop any light reflect towards the specti•ometer a these measure result in well-defined specti•al line it be assume that any systematic e1rnr from this source be neglible also another identify systematic enor be the width of specti•al line which if significantly wide would need to be measure use the vernier scale at each edge an average value could then be use in equation 8 to find the angle of diffraction however when this be do for the high order of diffraction use the measure angle on the vernier scale show that the width be too small for resolution of the vernier scale hence this systematic e1rnr be also ignore during the expe1iment a be assume to be neglible the lamp be also position relatively close to the collimator slit so that the intensity of the spectral line obse1ved in the eyepiece be more well define also the lamp be align with the collimator and grate so that the maximum amount of light would enter the collimator slit finally to reduce background light the inside of the hydrogen lamp have a black cover to stop any other light enter the collimate slit another systematic error encounter during the experiment be a spectrometer misalignment this be notice when the grate be position at 45 degree to the incident beam when the collimator slit and telescope be perpendicular to each other it be expect that the vernier scale would show 45 degree difference between both the collimator and telescope a the incident light be reflect off the grate however while these relative position in the spectrometer be correct the vernier scale read a value which be 3.90 degree off the expect theoretical value this may have be a problem with the manufacturer a another spectrometer of the same type show a similar misalignment when be set-up however a this be a systematic error which do n't affect the angle of diffraction when the spectrometer be set-up this have no bearing on the calculation of rydberg 's constant thus the systematic error involve be ignore the misalignment of the spectrometer have no affect on the measure angle of diffraction because when use equation 8 the measure position θ m and θ c be relative to only each other the main source of random error which be introduce in the experiment be when take measurement of the angle diffract by line spectrum use the vernier scale while the vernier scale be highly precise the main random error associate with the measure equipment be the resolution of the vernier scale which be estimate to be 0.05 degree this random error be estimate by judging how many division on the vernier scale appear to be also correct and then halve this range which be the estimate random error use for this the actual resolution in angle which the vernier scale can measure of 0.017 degree be not use for this estimation because of human error limit the resolution of the method far than the equipment use when visually observe the vernier scale it be apparent that there be no clear and correct mark to use thus it be estimate that 6 mark on the vernier scale appear to be the possible correct mark the estimate error of 0.05 degree be then found by calculate the angle cover by half of those division the other main random error associate with this method of measure be human error due to incorrectly reading the vernier scale poor judgment to approximate this random error two observer independently measure the angle of diffraction the mean value be calculate a the average of the two reading the standard error be then calculate and use a the associate estimate of this random error finally to estimate the combine random error associate with each angle of diffraction the approximate random error be add to get the combine estimate error associate with each angle measure on the vernier scale then a the angle of diffraction be calculate use equation 8 the estimate random error of each respective angle measure θ m and θ c be add in quadrature a equation 7 be use to find the wavelength of light emit a part of the hydrogen balmer series the value and associate error of sin θ for each order of diffraction be found the value be found by inputting the angle of diffraction to find the associate error the follow formula be use where φ be the estimate error of each respective angle of diffraction this approximation for the error be use because φ be relatively small thus could assume that around θ the curve approach linearity this meant that the error above and below the value of sin θ be the same also since the value of θ be relatively small a small angle approximation also support this method of approximate the associate error use equation 7 to find the wavelength of light emit from the hydrogen balmer series meant a graph of sin θ against m the order of diffraction be use the slit separation d multiply by the gradient of the graph would hence provide the wavelength computational analysis be use to create and analyze these graph for blue and red light a show in figure 3 4 5 and 6. figure 5. the graph use to find the wavelength of red light use equation 7 it be clear that the method use be highly precise due to the clear linear relationship exhibit and the small deviation of point to the line of best fit also method of reduce systematic error appear to have be successful a there be a relatively small y-intercept this method provide wavelength of 473 ± 10.2 nm and 659 ± 0.761 nm for the blue and red light respectively however when this be compare to the actual value of 486 nm and 656 nm respectively 4 the estimate result for blue and red light do n't include the expect value in their estimate error this indicate that the associate random error may have be underestimated and some source of error may not have be identify and include in the experimental calculation use equation 6 and error calculation provide from source 2 the estimate value and associate error of rydberg 's constant for red light where the orbital electron spontaneously emits the red light from initial quantum state n i 3 and blue light where the orbital electron spontaneously emits the blue light from initial quantum state n i 4 be calculate the estimate value and associate error of rydberg 's constant be 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 for red light and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 for blue light compare to the accepted value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 the respective percentage error produce for rydberg 's constant be 0.38 and 2.67 however a the estimate value for the wavelength of blue and red light do n't include the expect value the estimate value for rydberg 's constant also do n't include the theoretical value the aim of this experiment be to determine the rydberg constant through investigate the hydrogen balmer series use a grate spectrometer this be achieve by use a pasco student spectrometer and hydrogen lamp the optical spectrometer be use to measure the angle of diffraction for multiple order for the red and blue light emit a part of the hydrogen balmer series graphical and computational analysis be then use to attain precise estimate value for rydberg 's constant the experiment provide estimate value for rydberg 's constant of 1.093 ± 0.001 × 10 7 m -1 for red light and 1.127 ± 0.024 × 10 7 m -1 for blue light this be compare to the accepted theoretical value of rydberg 's constant of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 with red and blue light produce respective percentage error for rydberg 's constant of 0.38 and 2.67 the experiment be able to successfully reduce the main source of systematic error a show by the observe spectral line which be well define the misalignment of the spectrometer by 3.90 degree however be a systematic error which could n't be resolve during the experiment also the measurement take be highly accurate with the vernier scale be use to obtain high resolution reading and reduce human error significantly however the experiment do n't obtain estimate result which include the theoretical value of rydberg 's constant this indicate that the estimation of random error be n't a accurate a possible this may have be due to underestimate the random error associate with reading the vernier scale or it equati on of l ine of best f i t 0.05194 x 0.005208 ■ may have be a significant source of random error which be n't take into consideration to improve the experiment an align spectrometer should be use to repeat the method a the vernier scale may have be unprecise which be perceive a be misalign in the experiment which would be a significant random error which could n't be test for also a more sophisticated experimental set-up could be use such a a computer-aided spectrophotometer to obtain more accurate result this could also allow other wavelength of light from the hydrogen

40,GS_XMC918_Redacted,the uncertainty in the measurement of each angle be estimate simply by take several reading of each maximum and compare them to find a range the uncertainty use for each data point be then half the total range which be found to be 1/6 of a degree source of systematic error be mostly not possible for u to measure in the time available so for example we do not obtain enough measurement of maximum to both side of the centre to compare them and as how much error may be arise from slight asymmetry in the alignment of the spectrometer instead the result here be base on measurement just to one side of the centre and this error can not be quantify similarly other potential source of error such a atmospheric condition affect the optical property of the air and therefore alter the wavelength due to a potential change in the speed of light be not account for a these condition i.e humidity air pressure be not measure when the experiment be be carry out furthermore a other work be be do in the lab variation in background light could not be avoid meaning some data point may have underestimated uncertainty if background light be high when the measurement be take specifically to the setup we use the spectrometer be balance on a table which do not perfectly sit flat on the table we attempt to prevent it wobble while we make our measurement by place some paper under one of the leg but this do not seem to fully remedy the problem so it may have create some random error if it be not in exactly the same position for all the measurement the result we be able to obtain include only two wavelength of the balmer series a low wavelength be not visible with the set up use the two correspond to n value of 3 for the red light and 4 for the blue violet light which we assume to correspond to n=5 be visible only to the first maximum and so we be unable to gather enough data point to calculate a precise value for it wavelength and other colour be not visible at all a show in fig 2 and 3 the data fit extremely well to a linear relationship a predict by our model this allow u to calculate value for the wavelength of 6614762x10 -13 +/-7x10 -13 m for the red light and 47739x10 -11 +/-1x10 -11 m for the blue use 2 the mean value of the rydberg constant obtain from 3 be 11028400+/-100m -1 this do not agree with the accepted value of 10973731.6m -1 which would suggest that systematic error in the experiment have a significant impact however consider the individual value for the two different colour the red light give a value approximately 1 low than the accepted value while the blue light give one approximately 2 high rather than support the idea that it be cause by systematic error it instead implies that the problem be that random error be underestimated the most likely candidate for this phenomenon be the unstable table on which the spectrometer be balance mention in section iii it would explain why the two data set show very little error within themselves and yet the two data set both conflict with both one another and the accepted value it be possible that other source of error played their part such a background light and atmospheric condition however it seem less likely that these would have give such a clear divide between the two data set the unstable table would be more likely a the data set be take very close together give limited time for such a distinct change in humidity or pressure also background light fluctuate throughout the experiment with no chance of give such a distinct contrast in the two set of reading another contribution to the error in our result be likely not accounting for possible asymmetry in our set up by only measure to one side of the centre it be possible that if we have do so we would have notice the effect of the unstable table and have a chance of quantify the resultant error instead we be left with no way of state with any certainty whether this or another unidentified source of error lead to the issue in our final value use our method we be able to obtain a value for the rydberg constant which fell within 1 of the accepted value however a we underestimated the systematic error inherent in our set up our value conflict with the accepted value despite be so close in order to make it a useful measurement we would need to return to the experiment and thoroughly investigate and quantify the impact of all potential source of systematic error described in section iii once this be do it would be possible to both more confidently state which source of error cause the issue in this experiment and to repeat the experiment with well control and understand of these error to obtain a more accurate value of the rydberg constant another improvement that could likely give a significant increase in the accuracy and precision achievable would be if extra wavelength could be observe to increase the amount of data available this could be achieve either by change the source to one in which low wavelength be brighter and could be measure another possibility be to use other method of observation than the naked eye allow infra-red ultra violet or both to be observe in addition once again this would simply increase the amount of data available to use in calculation thereby reduce statistical error and give a more precise final

41,GS_BKZ271_Redacted,"electron in an atom undergo transition in between energy level in the atom when these transition be from a high energy state to a low state the excess energy be emit in the form of a photon of a certain wavelength for this experiment we use a hydrogen discharge lamp and a spectrometer the transition emit photon in the visible region of the spectrum be grouped together into

the product of the slope of this plot and the slit separation give u the wavelength the initial and final energy level can be decide base on the colour of the spectral line a only certain wavelength

thus use equation 1 2 and 3 we get which mean here m be call the order number λ be the wavelength and d be the separation between two adjacent slit light of a give colour will be diffract at a specific angle for a give order all light ray of that colour will be parallel if the incident light ray be parallel light of a different colour be diffract at a different angle but it light ray will also be parallel accord to the theory quantum mechanic an electron bound to an atom can not have any value of energy rather it can only occupy certain state which correspond to certain energy level the formula define the energy level of a hydrogen atom be give by the equation e -e0/n 2 where e0 13.6 ev 1 ev 1.602×10 -19 joule and n 1,2,3… and so on the energy be express a a negative number because it take that much energy to unbind ionize the electron from the nucleus when an electron absorbs a photon it gain the energy of the photon because an electron bound to an atom can only have certain energy the electron can only absorb photon of certain energy if a photon have more energy than the binding energy of the electron then the photon will free the electron from the atom -ionizing it the electron once it have absorbed photon be now in an excite state an electron have a certain probability to drop from one excite state to a low i.e more negative energy level when an electron drop from a high level to a low level it shed the excess energy a positive amount by emit a photon the transition be classify into different series base on the energy of the emit photon for this

consist of focus the eyepiece on the cross wire such that the set be free of eye strain best do with both eye open next the camera lens be focus such that a distant object be focus onto the cross wire now the telescope be align with the collimator see figure 5 for the next part of calibration a sodium-vapour lamp be use the wavelength of the lamp be know to be an average of two line and be precisely 589.3nm this lamp be then place in front of the slit of the spectrometer the telescope be move through 90° and clamped and a grate be put in the holder this diffraction grate be one that have 80 lines/mm line per millimetre the grate be adjust to see a reflect image of the slit meaning the grate be at 45° with respect to the collimator beam once the image be centre on the cross wire the reading of the scale be note and the grate be rotate through precisely 45 degree thus set it at normal incidence the height of the image can also be adjust use the adjustment screw to centre it on the cross wire the spectrometer be now calibrate and set up to take measurement with a precision of under 0.3 or about ±0.2 nm for yellow-orange light 8 the aim of this part of the experiment be to use the spectrometer to measure the wavelength use the grate equation eqn 4 consider the angular separation of fringe from the central fringe to be θ. then measure θ for different value of m both positive and negative with the sign indicate the side of displacement left or right the width of the slit of the spectrometer can be adjust vary the intensity and hence the width of the observe spectral line refer to table 1 for measure value for both red and purple spectral line note the slit of the spectrometer be use be misalign cause the spectral line to be cut horizontally this however do not affect the measure process or the obtain value a the spectrometer be very precise and the hydrogen lamp be an emitter of pure wavelength single value or discreet table 1 from eqn 4 the grate use be 78.8 line per mm or 2001 line per inch thus give a value for 'd which be then use to calculate the wavelength of the light this be do for 3 different transitions-namely red blue and violet show below be the plot for the violet spectral line refer to appendix 2 for red spectral line 's data the wavelength of the line be then calculate use the gradient slope of the plot the error in the gradient and the slit separation d the wavelength of the red spectral line be calculate to be 678.9 ± 46.8 𝑛𝑚 and that of the violet spectral line be 443 ± 2.1 𝑛𝑚 now that the wavelength have be calculate it can be use to determine that value of rydberg 's constant each transition emits a discreet wavelength in the visible spectrum a show below in table 2 from the table the value of 𝑛 𝑓 and 𝑛 𝑖 be use a 𝑛 1 and 𝑛 2 from eqn 5 now the value of rydberg 's constant can be calculate use eqn 5 rearrange eqn 5 every observe spectral line have a certain angular spread when observe through the spectrometer this spread can be minimise by narrow the slit of the instrument for most visible line the slit can be kept narrow enough so the error be immeasurable with this apparatus but a you pan farther out the line be blur and can not be view with a narrow slit in these case the angular spread of the line be measure and that be use a a measure of the uncertainty in the measurement of the position of the line the uncertainty in table 1 be these very angular spread since these be measure for the furthest line observe the error be the maximum possible for the precede line also thus this have be accepted a the maximum possible error in each colour in equation 8 m and d be know and so the uncertainty in λ be directly related to the uncertainty in the position the error in the value of rydberg 's constant be simply the error in the inverse wavelength a the value in table 2 be know with certainty thus the error 𝜎 𝜃 be for red 𝜎 𝜃 1'48 `` and violet 𝜎 𝜃 3′ the error calculate for the red spectral line be 46.8 𝑛𝑚 and that for the violet spectral line be 2.1 𝑛𝑚 fri nge order 'm use the value of wavelength 𝑛 𝑖 𝑛 𝑓 and the error calculate a above rydberg 's constant be calculate to be the value of rydberg 's constant obtain from the experiment for red and violet spectral line be 1.061 ± 0.073 x10 7 m −1 and 1.061 ± 0.01 𝑥 10 7 𝑚 −1 respectively although these value do not coincide with the accepted value of rydberg 's constant which be 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 their uncertainty cover this value this uncertainty however may arise from several source both random and systematic one of the main cause of a random error be the overheat of the hydrogen lamp which may alter the data and increase uncertainty the change in pressure of the gas in the discharge tube could also contribute to random error a the gas pressure be increase the spike become broader this 'pressure broadening be a direct consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle and stem from the fact that a the pressure increase the gas molecule undergo more and more collision thus reduce the average time for which a molecule can remain in a give electronic state the heisenberg principle implies that a the lifetime of give state decrease it energy becomes less and less well define the net result be that the characteristic emission wavelength be smeared-out into band 10 the more systematic error however arise mainly from misalignment or wrong calibration of the spectrometer the correct focus of the spectrometer telescope may also add to the error in measure the position of spectral line since the observation of spectral line depends on the light passing through the slit the position of the lamp in front of the slit can add to the uncertainty in position of the line if it be n't place precisely in front of the slit a mention previously the slit of the spectrometer be misalign cause break in the spectral line but a these break in the line be horizontal in nature it do not affect the measurement the above factor when estimate and include in the uncertainty provide a realistic estimate about the officially accepted value of rydberg 's constant the aim of this experiment be to determine the value of rydberg 's constant to a certain degree of precision and accuracy use a grate spectrometer a sodium-vapour lamp for calibration and a hydrogen discharge lamp to observe the spectral line the basic theory behind this experiment be derive from the principle and theory of diffraction atomic spectrum and the basic idea of quantum physic the chance of success be strong with this experiment a it u apparatus with a low margin for error since most of the data analysis be do on python error due to calculation and human error be minimise although there be n't many light must be shone on the few yet significant possibility of error in this experiment since the measure equipment consists of a spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp the main source of error be the relative position of the lamp slit and diffraction grate also since the position of the telescope and centre of the cross wire be do use our naked eye accuracy be very limited there be also the systematic error that arises from the spread of wavelength widen of the spectral line this error however can not be measure a beyond a point the cross wire be too thick to accurately measure the angular width of the spectral line improvement in term of accuracy can be make by use electronic detector instead of our naked eye although our eye be sensitive they be n't sensitive enough to observe the line when the slit be at it narrow position this be prominent when two different observer may detect vary spectral line to vary degree of accuracy perform this experiment help develop skill in take measurement

we can use it to predict the wavelength emit from any atom through any energy state transmission r can also be use therefore to determine the difference in energy state through which any electron in any atom may transfer give u the value for the energy state in that atom the theory of this behavior be described in more depth in section ii spectroscopy be use to enable the repeat observation of one beam emit from the lamp when set up correctly a spectrometer be capable of make very accurate and repeatable measurement so it be important to set it up very specifically the equipment we use consist of a collimator a diffraction grate and a telescope by passing it through a diffraction grate the light beam be split up meaning multiple order could be analyze to obtain multiple value for the wavelength a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm be employ to achieve this the beam be then pas through a telescope to enable observation far description of the work of the setup can be found in section iii to carry out the experiment we observe the emission of a hydrogen lamp a tube contain low-pressure hydrogen gas after excitation through heating or electrify for example the atom in the gas lose energy in the form of photon a an electron in an atom transfer to a low energy state it emits a photon of energy equal to the difference in energy of the two state in a sample of one element only energy level of specific value exist thus only transition of specific energy can occur the photoelectric effect then result in the production of photon of certain wavelength only spectrum produce by excite gas be observe a have emission at just a few wavelength create an 'emission line spectrum in hydrogen these 'lines be give the name the balmer series 1 in the laboratory we observe just two line of which the wavelength be give by 2 where λ be the wavelength of the light emit and n represent the initial and p the final state of the atom in the balmer series p=2 and n=3,4,5 ... the fact that only line of two different color be observe do not prove n=5 do not exist it be possible other wavelength of non-visible light be emit by the gas or that the atom be not excite enough for the electron to occupy state n=5 far experimentation would be need to confirm this in order to obtain multiple measurement of λ different order of the emission line spectrum be look at figure 1 illustrates how a diffraction grate disperses a beam the order of the beam m can in theory be any integer m and  the angle between the 0 th order and the m th order be related by the equation grate be usually give by the manufacturer in term of n number of line per mm d be easily found by calculate n must be multiply by 10 3 first to find how many line there be per m so that d can be in unit m. in this calculation we assume the thickness of each line be negligible by measure the angle  for several value of m and plot m against sin the gradient of the graph becomes d λ ⁄ after multiplication by d 1 λ ⁄ can be substitute into 1 the light from the hydrogen lamp be first to be pas through a narrow slit follow by a collimate lens to produce a very thin collimate beam and then pas through a diffraction grate the light then be to be collect by a telescope consist of a camera lens and an eyepiece a crosshair x be visible through the telescope eyepiece to help with alignment all measurement be take with the line on the centre of the crosshair figure 2 illustrates the path of the beam through the setup a choice of two grate be available in our laboratory on of 300 line per mm and one of 78.8 line per mm i originally decide to use the grate n=300 because i thought this would result in a small percentage error for d take the error would be 0.05 line per mm however upon look through the eyepiece it be see that there be more visible order with the use of the n=78.8 grate so it be decide that we use this one in order to have the opportunity to obtain the maximum number of measurement so that  could be varied the grate be mount on a rotate grate table or turntable and the telescope which be attach to the turntable could also be rotate the turntable have a vernier scale on it which show the angular position of the turntable and the telescope use this  be measure these property be show in figure 3. the turntable be also utilized to accurately set up the spectroscopy equipment the grate have to be at precisely 90 to the beam achieve this be challenge the vernier scale on the turntable have a resolution of a sixtieth of a degree so tiny movement in the position of the telescope and angle of the table could be make such movement be make roughly and then fine-tuned use fine adjustment screw before the telescope and turntable be clamped into place it be important not to leave the hydrogen lamp on for more than 10 minute so a not to damage it so it be temporarily replace with a sodium lamp whilst position adjustment be make firstly the telescope be position so the source could be see to be align with the crosshair at 0 to the beam it be then rotate through exactly 90 and a mirror insert into the clamp where the grate would later sit this be exactly what be demonstrate in figure 3. the rotate grate table be then adjust until the beam could be see through the eyepiece of the telescope meaning the mirror be at 45 to the beam the turntable could then be rotate through 45 in order for the mirror to be at 90 to the beam at which point it be replace with the diffraction grate the slit space must remain a control variable so the same diffraction grate be use throughout the experiment keep d constant it be difficult to perceive the line through the eyepiece at the begin of the experiment due to background light to try to minimize this problem the main light be turn off in the laboratory with each desk have it own table lamp which be switch off during observation through the eyepiece light from other desk 's experiment still present a problem so a piece of black card with a collimator-shaped hole be cut out and stuck round the collimator with blu-tac this prove very effective in block out background light once set up the equipment be left clamped in position so only the telescope could be move this kept the turntable in a fix positon ensure the grate remain at the same angle to the beam and the 0 th order emission line remain in the same position the source be then switch back to a hydrogen lamp through the eyepiece we observe emission line spectrum of two different color one blue and one red we concentrate on the set separately to find two value for the rydberg constant rb and rr respectively blue be take first the crosshair be line up with the 0 th order line which be identifiable by the fact that it be both red and blue the reading on the vernier at 0 th order 0 be note and then the three repeat reading of m be take one by each of my lab partner and i. this be do in order to spot with a view to remove any personal bias then an average be take to minimize variation in human judgement of the reading the measurement have to be take through a magnify glass a the scale be very small and the light low the range of m be restrict by the lack of accessibility to the eyepiece at large angle and also the time we have in the laboratory it be interest to note at this point that the blue line be separate by less angle than the red which illustrate the proportionality of sin to  a predict in 2 since blue wavelength be shorter than red one after collection of the raw data average of the three repeat reading be take in order to find  for each value of m 0 minus m be calculate after the rearrangement of 2 m be plot against sin for both blue and red light a figure 4 and figure 5 respectively which be show below in python the of the line of best for of both graph be obtain the gradient of the blue light emission graph be found to be 25.642 0.650 and the red 19.1730.097 the gradient of the graph be equal to d λ ⁄ recall 3 d be calculate to be 1.26910 -5 m 0.06 take the error in n to be 0.05 line per mm the gradient of both graph be then divide by d to obtain value for 1 λ ⁄ 1 λ b ⁄ be found to be 2.02110 6 m -1 which be repeatable because this would give a blue wavelength b of 495nm the range of blue light be 450-495nm 3 and this figure be within the range 1 λ r ⁄ be also repeatable since it be calculate to be 1.51110 6 m -1 which give a red wavelength r of 662nm also within the accepted range for red light 620-750nm 3 it be give that the two balmer transition have initial state n=4 and n=3 and final state p=2 2 we can use the idea that the energy of a photon be proportional to the frequency of the photon therefore inversely proportional to it wavelength to decide which color light corresponds to which energy state transition from this we can deduce that the transition from n=4 to p=2 result in the blue emission because this be the large energy state transfer and blue light have the small wavelength by elimination the red light be a result of the transition from n=3 to p=2 these value for p and n be then fill into 1 to obtain r ∞ from observation of blue light rb be found to be 1.07810 7 m -1 and from red rr 1.08810 7 m -1 systematic error be then address the computer calculate uncertainty on the gradient and the percentage error in d be add in quadrature to give b of 0.027m -1 and r of 0.006m -1 the percentage error for rr be small only 0.51 whereas that of rb be almost five time large 2.5 one can see from the position of the data point relative to the line of best fit in figure 4 that this be due to the presence of more variation with blue light which lead to a great uncertainty in the gradient the gradient error at first seem large on paper there should not have be much variation in the experiment because there be not many outside factor which could affect the setup moreover the equipment have a very small resolution the vernier measure to a sixtieth of a degree meaning uncertainty in the take of the reading should have be small however the experiment be conduct in very poor light for reason mention in iii a. which result in difficulty with reading the vernier scale even with the use of a magnify glass we rely on human judgement to deduce where the scale line up exactly from the raw data you can see that my lab partner and i all thought the scale line up at slightly different reading this introduce random error the range of  m be only about 9 so any error in the vernier reading whilst small result in a percentage uncertainty which be large than one would automatically expect furthermore due to the calculation 0 minus m any uncertainty the measurement for  would be double that in also the set up of the spectrometer have to be do very precisely it be possible we do not take sufficient care in do this a result of this could be that the grate be not at exactly 90 to the beam i be not sure how this would affect the scatter of the beam far investigation would be need to confirm if this could have be a source of error there be far error to consider in this experiment one of which be the fact that the line in the observe spectrum have width although we align the center of the crosshair with the line we do not account for the fact that the line have a width result in uncertainty in the position of the line and therefore in m i do not have time in the laboratory to investigate the size and implication of this error so have not include it in b or r but would have do so if i have have more time the rydberg constant have the measure value 10,973,731.6m -1 2 let u compare this with our calculate value for r of 10,780,000m -1 270,000 m -1 and 10,880,000 m -1 270,000 m -1 firstly let u establish if our two figure be concurrent with each other take into account uncertainty the low rr could be be 1.08310 7 m -1 and the high rb could be be 1.10510 7 m -1 the two result be therefore in agreement with each other a they lie within each other 's range the measure value for r also lie within the range we calculate in the laboratory although it only lie within the range of the blue emission line the large rr could be be 1.09310 7 m -1 rr in contrast be closer to the measure value than rb in the laboratory the rydberg constant have be determine to be in the range of 1.05310 7 m -1 to 1.10510 7 m -1 this be concurrent with the measure value of r which be 10,973,731.6m -1 technique involve spectroscopic equipment be employ to obtain this range overall this method work very well once in position the spectroscopy equipment be simple to use and enable u to make precise measurement also there be only three parameter to measure in this experiment  0  m and n. this kept the magnitude of the systematic uncertainty low have we allow more time for the experiment we could have set up the spectrometer to a more exact standard which would have reduce the uncertainty on measurement take from the telescope it would also have be useful to use a vernier scale of large size to enable easy reading and therefore less error due to human judgement if the experiment have be conduct in a separate room the main light could have be switch on for the reading of the vernier again make the scale easy to read and reduce the error use a desk that be not situate adjacent to a wall therefore allow access to all angle of the telescope would have enable u to analyze more order of the emission line spectrum give u a figure for r closer to the true value alternatively a diffraction grate of small n could have be use cause the order to have small angle between them therefore more order would be see in the angle range permit by our setup and more value of m analyze",superficial,bal

× 10 7 the accepted value be ∼ 1.097373 × 10 7 the percentage error be ≈ 1 however the accepted value lie outside our uncertainty the small uncertainty obtain be due to the small error in the diffraction angle 10 arcminute and negligible error in the diffraction grate space t he hydrogen lamp that we will be use be a thin discharge tube that contains gaseous hydrogen at low temperature apply a high potential difference across the tube excites electron of the hydrogen atom 1 so that they be elevate to a high energy state when the electron transition back down to a quantise level of low energy a photon be emit the energy of the photon be equal to the energy difference between the level transition 2 the hydrogen atom in our discharge tube will be emit visible light and we will be use a diffraction grate to split up the light into it constituent wavelength the result series of spectral line be part of the balmer series 3 and be described by the rydberg formula see theory equation 1 when electron transition from quantise energy level n 3 4 5 ... to the energy level of principal quantum number n 2 4 we be observe the balmer line rather than other line from other hydrogen spectral series because the balmer line lie in the visible part of the spectrum in this experiment we will first use the grate spectrometer to measure the angle of diffraction that the colour blue green and red undergo in order to calculate their wavelength use the grate equation 5 from this a value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h can be obtain a it be know what transition be make by an electron in the hydrogen atom to emit each wavelength of light we be analyse study of the balmer series and therefore use of the rydberg constant have it application due to the abundance of hydrogen in the universe an example be in astronomy particularly in the classification of star base on their surface temperature the strength or weakness of spectral line like those in the balmer series can indicate temperature 6 we be calculate the rydberg constant because of it important role in the rydberg formula which describes the wavelength of light emit when an electron transition from a high energy energy shell to a low energy shell within the atom this formula be of great importance due to it application and due to it contribution to the development and evolution of the atomic model chemical element can only absorb and emit photon with quantise wavelength for many chemical element these wavelength be described by the rydberg formula where λ b be the wavelength of the emit light r ∞ be the rydberg constant and n i and n f be the energy level or principal quantum number of the orbitals occupy by the electron before and after it transition respectively for our hydrogen discharge lamp the result series of spectral line be call the balmer series 7 the balmer line be the result of the follow process firstly an electron in the hydrogen atom absorbs energy in this case supply from the apply voltage across the tube and accord to the bohr model of the atom the energy absorbed by an electron to transition to a high energy level in this experiment to n 3 4 or 5 must be a multiple of an amount of energy equal to hcr ∞ where h be plank 's constant and c be the speed of light in vacuo 2 and can not be any amount of energy secondly once the electron have absorbed a quantum of sufficient energy it then transition or `` quantum leap `` to a high more unstable orbital n i this be follow by a spontaneous transition to the more stable orbital of principal quantum number n f 2 emit energy equal to the difference in energy between the two energy level in the form of a photon 8 the process of an electron transition from an excite state to a low energy state and in the process emit a photon be call spontaneous emission other series can be obtain such a the lyman series n f 1 or the paschen series n f 3 2 set n f 2 the rydberg equation becomes the balmer formula and the constant becomes r h the rydberg constant for hydrogen it can be show that the rydberg constant for hydrogen can be express in term of other more fundamental constant electron charge e the mass of an electron m e permittivity of free space 0 plank 's constant h and the speed of light in vacuo c in the follow equation see appendix a for derivation the result value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen be 10973731.6m −1 5 for the emission of a photon of blue light the principal quantum number of an electron in the excite state be n i 5. for green n i 4 and for red n i 3. we will determine with a grate spectrometer and use of the grate equation see equation 3 the wavelength of the aforementioned colour in the grate spectrometer set-up light from the hydrogen lamp first pas through a slit to make a point source of light the collimator lens make the light ray parallel so it can then be diffract through a grate the wave energy spread out behind the grate because the slit space d be comparable in size to the wavelength of visible light d 78.8 line per mm the wave that spread out interfere and the result be spectral line the zeroth order spectral line occur at a diffraction angle of zero degree the high the order spectral line the great the angle the light have be diffract through a telescope be move to locate the various order and focus the spectral line to make a measurement of the diffraction angle θ. if the difference in path to a point some distance away much great than d between two slit be an integer number m of wavelength λ the two wave will meet at that point in phase result in a maximum a region of constructive interference see in figure 1 9 the difference in path be also equal to d sin θ the constituent colour have different wavelength so each correspond maximum for each colour have a different diffraction angle fig 2 show the expect intensity of light from a discharge tube akin to the hydrogen lamp we be use a a function of the diffraction angle if only 4 slit be illuminate the large peak be principal maximum and the small peak be secondary maximum since the intensity of secondary maximum be much less than principal maximum distinct spectral line be resolve 5 the position of spectral line occur at angle of 2πm be m be call the order number and be an integer before measurement of the diffraction angle can be make the diffraction grate must be align with the collimator first the eyepiece be focus on the cross-hair to eliminate any eye-strain when view through it the camera lens be focus use the focus knob see fig 3 7 on a distant object so that the telescope be set up to receive parallel light since light passing through the collimator in the spectrometer will be become parallel a sharp image of the entrance slit attach to the collimator when view through the telescope be achieve by adjust the collimator focus and slit size such that an image of a thin slit be form at the cross-hair when the telescope be in line with the collimator the telescope be then move through precisely 90 • use the vernier scale so that it be perpendicular to the axis of the collimator and clamped in position use the telescope rotation lock screw a diffraction grate with slit space 78.8 line per mm be insert into the mount with ruling vertical like the entrance slit so that the order produce by the diffraction be horizontally align and therefore can be view with the telescope the entrance slit be then illuminate with a sodium lamp instead of hydrogen lamp because the hydrogen lamp can overheat and cease to emit light if left on for extend period of time and the grate and mount be then rotate by the spectrometer table until it reflect light from the collimator into the telescope 10 the slit image be then centre with the cross-hair and fine adjustment knob since the telescope and collimator be at 90 • the diffraction grate be therefore 45 • to the collimator and telescope the diffraction grate be then rotate precisely through 45 • use the vernier scale so that the plane of the diffraction grate be perpendicular to light from the collimator when switch on the hydrogen lamp with a potential difference of ∼ 5000v across it the prominent colour we could observe up to the 3 rd order be blue green and red background light from lamp in the room limited the number or order we could see a high order above 3 become too faint the diffraction angle θ be measure for order 0 to 3 by move the telescope so that the centre of the cross-hair reside on each appropriate spectral line the vernier scale on the spectrometer be accurate to 1 arc minute 7 show from above the way in which the telescope can be position to find the spectral line so that diffraction angle can be measure when the angle between the normal to the grate and the telescope be 0 • our vernier scale read 209 • and 29 arcminute we first record all the angle then subtract them from 209 • and 29 arcminute to correct for the systematic error the sine of the diffraction angle θ in radian be plot a a function of the order number m. the gradient be equal to sin θ/m and be equal to wavelength of the light divide by the slit space λ/d obtain by re-arranging the grate equation equation 3 the gradient multiply by the slit space d be equal to the wavelength of the observe balmer series colour λ b and the principal quantum number n i of the electron before the spontaneous emission be 5 4 and 3 for blue green and red respectively the value for r h be hence calculate for each wavelength by use equation 1. spectral line have some thickness and be not infinitely sharp therefore there be an uncertainty associate with the diffraction angle spectral line have this thickness because the atom emit the light be move relative to the observer and the energy level can not be define to exceedingly high or infinite precision due to heisenberg 's uncertainty principle see appendix b 13 the angle be measure to the left and right of the first order blue spectral line we measure this angle to be 10 arcminute the error in 1 d be assume to be negligible and the error in the diffraction angle be assume to be fix at 10 arcminute the error in the gradient be calculate by find the first entry in the covariance matrix for the data for each colour this be do in the computer program language python figure 5 -7 show the plot for each colour observe in the hydrogen balmer series use the correct angle where a reading of 209 • and 29 arcminute corresponds to 0 • between the normal to the diffraction grate and telescope the vertical error bar be very small for each plot a the spectral line be thin result in a small error in the diffraction angle another factor that contribute to small vertical error bar be the high accuracy of the vernier scale to the near 1 arcminute the plot for blue light result in the great error for r h an order of magnitude great than for green and red see table i a source of random error enter the experiment a the mark of the vernier scale be difficult to see and sometimes there be ambiguity a to which of the mark line up indicate the minute of arc the ambiguity if there be any be always with neighbour mark i estimate this error in diffraction angle to be 2 arcminute a the uncertainty be never more than two division to the left or to the right of the mark we chose to be line up add this to the uncertainty due to the assume thickness of the spectral line 10 arcminute the result error be 12 arcminute in the diffraction angle however because 2 arcminute be quite a small error in comparison to 10 arcminute the error in the gradient and error bar have not change noticeably when introduce an improve way of accounting for this random error which by definition change for each measurement be to note down after each reading which mark could also be line up then the angle record would be the mean of the angle half-way between the small and great angle because the ambiguity exist between neighbour mark and the uncertainty would be half the difference between the great and small potential diffraction angle there be no horizontal error bar because the principal maximum be discrete and countable table i below display the result use the gradient of figure 5 -7 and equation 3 to calculate the wavelength λ b table i also show the value of r h calculate use the rydberg formula equation 1 set n f 2 for each colour the error be denote by σ with a subscript to denote the quantity that the error be associate with and superscript with the colour it be associate with for example σ blue r h be the error in the value r h that be calculate with blue light the percentage error in the calculate value of r h for blue the error in our mean value for r h constitutes a possible variation in the mean of less than 1 ≈0.87 this error be small because the error in the diffraction angle measure be very small 12 arcminute include the estimate random error which be assume to be fix but may have change and no other error be consider a the error in the line per mm of the diffraction grate be assume to be negligible the percentage error in the mean r h be 1.42 however the accepted theoretical value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen lie outside our uncertainty a possible source of systematic error that may have contribute to the overall increase in our value for the mean r h may include incorrect calibration when align the diffraction grate this be unlikely to be the main source of error because the value for r h when use blue light be less than the accepted value this mean the primary source of error be likely to be random error the aim of the experiment be to calculate rydberg constant for hydrogen by take measurement of the hydrogen balmer series use a grate spectrometer to do this light from a hydrogen lamp be make parallel and pas through a diffraction grate each colour in the balmer series blue green and red diffract by different angle which be measure and the sine of the angle be plot a a function of the order of the spectral line we then calculate three value for the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each colour use the gradient of the plot our mean value for r h be 1.113000×10 7 ± 2.342×10 4 the mean differs by ≈ 1 of the actual accepted value 109737321.568508 which lie outside our uncertainty an improvement to our experiment would be to measure the diffraction angle to high order which would reduce the error in the gradient in order to achieve this we would have to perform the experiment in a darker room with no lamp so that high order for all colour be make visible a poor assumption be also make that the error in the diffraction angle be fix however an improvement would be to measure the thickness of each of the spectral line another improvement would be to measure diffraction angle spectral order go in the negative direction this would enable u to calculate more value for r h thus reduce the effect of random error appendix a derivation of the rydberg formula 13 14 use niels bohr 's picture of the atom we consider an electron orbit a proton where the centripetal and coulomb force equate the quantity r be the

slit a sodium lamp be use in setup rather than a hydrogen lamp a the latter would overheat after short period of time and switch off the focus of the collimator be then adjust so that an image of the slit be align with the cross wire this be complete without adjust the camera focus the demonstrator recommend rotate the cross wire to form a × rather than a a this meant that slit be easily visible the slow-motion drive and clamp screw be tune and final adjustment be make to the camera and collimator the telescope be rotate 90 degree and clamped into position a 300-slit grate be place into the holder and a ruler be use to ensure it be vertical the grate table be rotate until the diffraction grate be at a 45-degree angle from the incident light ray an initial observation of the position of the slit 's reflect image in the telescope be make and the height of the image be alter via the adjustment screw beneath the grate table reading on both scale the main scale which be graduate in degree and the secondary scale which be graduate in arcminute be take and the grate be then move through 45 degree ensure that the eyepiece be situate at 0 degree to the incident light ray the telescope be reposition temporarily so approximate position of the spectral line could be note the telescope be then revolve so that diffract image of the slit could be observe for different order e.g -2 -1 0 1 2. the error record on the result for the setup of the sodium lamp be 0.5 degree and 1 arcminute these value be base on the scale 's precision the error also consider difference between experimenter 1 's and experimenter 2 's reading table 1 illustrates the initial measurement make when set up the sodium lamp the preliminary result for the setup of the experiment show in table i be not usable a the eyepiece be not focus on the same maximum this meant that the reference angle be not suitable for take result the uncertainty in the preliminary and final result be close to negligible a the percentage uncertainty be in the magnitude of 1 × 10 −3 for both the preliminary and final result a sodium lamp be substitute for a hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be switch off when not in use to prevent overheat final adjustment be make to the slit size before measurement be take to ensure optimum intensity and resolution preliminary result be then record for each transition wavelength θ be measure against both positive and negative order some data value in the table have be replace by n/a which signifies that the reference angle for that order could not be obtain this be primarily due to light pollution from other lamp meaning that it be difficult to identify fringe line a the order m increase from -2 to 2 the reference angle decrease equation ii.2 implies that if sin θ be plot against the order m it will produce a linear relationship table iv the data for the reference angle be an average of the two-data set produce by the experimenter the result be take between order -2 and 2 where the range of the angle for red be from 168.42º to 215.03º the range for blue be from 176.94º to 207.12º and the range for purple be from 175.06º to 208.09º the final measurement follow the same general relationship a the preliminary measurement however the decrease in the reference angle becomes more consistent diminish by approximately 12º for red 8º for blue and 8º for purple whereas in the preliminary investigation the reference angle decrease by vary amount the main source of uncertainty with the result be due to parallax error an attempt to resolve this be make by take reading when level with the scale another source of error be due to the thickness of the fringe consequently all measurement be take in the centre of the fringe random error arose a it be difficult to see the cross in the dark and so the fringe be not consistently align this be resolve by periodically turn on the lamp to check alignment other potential source of systematic error be air pressure humidity and occasional defocus of the telescope both air pressure and humidity remain roughly constant during the investigation hence it be unnecessary to account for these variable moreover the defocus of the telescope be temporary and so be not problematic a with the error in the setup of the sodium lamp the percentage uncertainty in the reference angle be very small in the order of 1 × 10 −3 the percentage error in the gradient be very small in the order of 1 × 10 −2 for red and 1 × 10 −3 for purple this be due to the small y error bar and the lack of anomalous point in figure i. however the error in the y-intercept be very large a the percentage error have a magnitude of 1 × 10 2 this be a the y-intercept be small whilst the absolute error have remain roughly constant however the percentage error in the yintercept be unimportant a it be not use in calculate the rydberg constant a 300-slit grate be use so d be equal to 3.33 × 10 −6 m. use equation ii.8 the value of d and the gradient the calculate rydberg constant be 10989388.37m −1 the error in this number can be calculate by use the equation where σ x be the error in the gradient of red 0.003. this produce a figure of 0.1 × 10 7 m −1 see algebraic manipulation for both value in lab book the primary aim of the investigation be to measure the spectrum of hydrogen and to obtain an accurate value for the rydberg constant the secondary aim be to obtain an error of magnitude of less than 1 × 10 −3 the method involve make observation of the spectral line through the telescope the value of the reference angle on both the main and secondary scale be note a graph be produce of sin θ against order m and a gradient be determine from this the rydberg constant be obtain the success of the investigation be determine a value of the rydberg constant within one thousandth of the accepted value and produce a graph with no observable anomaly and a percentage error less than one percent the main failure of the experiment be produce an error of magnitude 1 × 10 −2 which come into conflict with the secondary aim the key achievement of the experiment be obtain a strong positive correlation for the linear plot for figure i and produce strong data analysis consist of error in both the gradient and y-intercept one improvement to the experimental method would be monitoring the environmental factor such a

final state of the atom respectively when an atom gain energy the electron move from a low energy level to a high one during excitation this excite state be not stable and the electron drop from a high energy level to a low one result in the emission of a photon whose energy be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial state of the atom therefore the colour of the light emit can be determine by calculate the frequency of the photon emit use formula 2 hence the balmer series in hydrogen can be give by equation 5 with 𝑝 2 and 𝑛 3,4,5….the idea of bohr 's model of the atom

to determine the value of wavelength 𝜆 a straight line graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 have to be drawn whose gradient would be equal to 𝜆 𝑑 therefore enable u to calculate λ. the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 at each diffraction order have to be determine by subtract the average diffraction angle at each specific order 𝜃 by the average angle at zeroth order 𝜃 0 and then take the sine of the difference between the two angle finally use formula 5 the rydberg constant for each spectral line could be determine the diffraction angle be measure use the vernier scale that read at sixtieth of a degree there be a risk of random error appear when use the vernier scale due to parallax error through the use of the magnify glass the effect of parallax error be minimise the angle at zeroth order be determine for the red and blue spectral line the diffraction angle measurement be repeat three time at each order number and the average be take so that the reliability of our measurement could be enhance and so that random error could be encounter possible source of systematic error be humidity and background light permittivity of free space varies with humidity therefore this affect our value of the rydberg constant because the rydberg constant a show by formula 3 and 4 depends on the value of the permittivity of free space therefore systematic error be introduce in the experiment background light make our eye less sensitive therefore we can not see well hence we could end up miss line for the effect of background light on our measurement to be minimise a black card be take a hole be punch in it and the card be then stuck around the collimator another method we use to minimise the effect of background light be to cover the apparatus with a black cloth because it prevent the external light from go into the collimator and show up on the image after determine the average diffraction angle in each order number the follow formula have to be use to determine the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 which be the y-coordinates for plot the sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 graph y-coordinate 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 9 where 𝜃 be the average diffraction angle at a specific order number and 𝜃 0 be the average

zeroth order and then the sine of the difference between the angle be take after determine the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 for each order number a straight line graph of 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 be drawn use python with gradient equal to 𝜆 𝑑 both the slope of the straight line for the two spectral line together with their associate uncertainty be determine use python thereby enable u to determine the wavelength 𝜆. use formula 5 the rydberg constant for the red and blue spectral line be deduce to calculate the rydberg constant use formula 5 for the two spectral line the balmer series transition be consider therefore use n=2 and p=5 for the calculation of the rydberg constant of the blue spectral line and n=2 p=3 for the rydberg constant determination of the red spectral line a sample calculation for the determination of the wavelength of the red spectral line be show 𝜆 𝑑𝑔 𝜆 6.62 × 10 −7 𝑚 where 𝑔 be the slope of the graph equal to 5.22× 10 −2 ± 1.20 × 10 −3 and 𝑑 be the

by figure 3 the uncertainty in our 𝜃 value be determine use python to calculate the standard error of the mean for each average 𝜃 value at each order number for each spectral line before calculate the standard error of the mean the standard deviation have to be calculate use the follow equation the sample standard deviation 𝑆 be define by where 𝑁 be the sample size equal to 3 in our experiment since we repeat our diffraction angle measurement 3 time for each order number 𝑥̅ be the sample mean in our case the average diffraction angle in each order number 𝑥 𝑖 represent each of the value of the data in our case the diffraction angle in each order number use the standard deviation to estimate the uncertainty of each diffraction angle measure use the vernier scale the standard error of the

minimum average diffraction angle at each order number be determine use the standard error of the mean of those angle which be equal to the uncertainty in those angle the calculation be carry out in python use the uncertainty in the value of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 the vertical error bar in the graph of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against m correspond to those uncertainty be plot in python a show in figure 3. this enable u use python to determine the uncertainty in the slope of each straight line so that it could be use to determine the overall uncertainty of the rydberg constant value of the red and blue spectral line in this experiment the 78.8 ± 0.1 line per mm grate be chosen instead of the 100,200 and 300 line per mm grate since although the narrower the slit the great the resolution of the line the line become much dimmer a the slit be close therefore to balance out these two consideration the 78.8 ± 0.1 line per mm grate be the most appropriate in this experiment enable u to take more measurement of the diffraction angle hence increase the reliability of our result by encounter random error the number of line per unit length of our slit in the begin be suppose to be 80 line per mm but they be 78.8 ± 0.1 line per mm because it use an old definition of 2001 line per inch which be in imperial unit the 2001 line per inch approximate to 78.8 line per mm to calculate the uncertainty in 𝑑 𝜎 𝑑 the follow method be use where 𝑛 78.9 and 𝑛 78.8 be the number of line 78.9 and 78.8 line respectively the uncertainty in 𝑑 be found to be 1.61× 10 −8 m therefore our value of 𝑑 could be state a 1.27× 10 −5 m± 1.61 × 10 −8 m. to determine the uncertainty in the be determine by where 𝜎 𝑑 be the uncertainty in the slit separation value 𝑑 be the slit separation value 𝜎 𝑔 be the uncertainty in the slope of the straight line of best fit of sin 𝜃 − 𝜃 0 against 𝑚 and 𝑔 be the slope of this straight line it be possible to use quadrature to calculate the uncertainty in when the rydberg constant of the red and blue spectral line together with their correspond uncertainty be determine then the overall rydberg constant value could be calculate together with it uncertainty this can be do by calculate the weight average of the rydberg constant of the two spectral line and then find the uncertainty on the weight average the follow formula be use to calculate the weight average the weight average value of the rydberg constant of the two line 𝑅 ∞ 𝑎𝑣𝑒 be define by where 𝑅 ∞ 𝑟𝑒𝑑 be the rydberg constant of the red spectral line and 𝜎 𝑅∞ 𝑟𝑒𝑑 it associate uncertainty.𝑅 ∞ 𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒 be the rydberg constant of the blue spectral line and 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ 𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒 be it uncertainty to determine the uncertainty in the overall value of the rydberg constant deduce from the weight average of the rydberg constant of the two spectral line 𝜎 𝑅∞ 𝑎𝑣𝑒 the follow equation be use where 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ 𝑟𝑒𝑑 be the uncertainty in the rydberg constant of the red spectral line and 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ 𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒 be the uncertainty in the rydberg constant of the blue spectral line the overall value of the rydberg constant determine in the experiment use formula 16 and formula 17 be 1.077 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 2.400 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 by observe the spectral line of hydrogen the value of the rydberg constant we obtain for the blue and red spectral line be 0.965 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 8.44 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 and 1.087 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 2.500 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 respectively the overall value of the rydberg constant determine from the weight average of the rydberg constant of the two spectral line be 1.077 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 2.400 × 10 5 𝑚 −1 it uncertainty brings the measurement into the range cover the true value of rydberg constant of 1.097 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 ± 6.500 × 10 −6 𝑚 −1 show that our measure value be compatible there could have be improvement on the method carry out to determine the rydberg constant even though we repeat our diffraction angle measurement 3 time for each order number use the vernier scale to take measurement we could have repeat the angle measurement more time to encounter random error and make result more reliable the use of the magnify glass while take the diffraction angle measurement reduce the effect of parallax error therefore make our measurement more accurate during the experiment we try to reduce the effect of background light either by cover the apparatus use a black cloth or punch a hole in the middle of a black card and stick it around the collimator so that external light be prevent from enter the collimator and show up on the image background light could have be a source of systematic error by make our eye less sensitive make u not see properly and we could have widen the slit reduce uncertainty if i repeat the experiment i would take into account humidity and try to determine how much it affect our rydberg constant value because it varies with the value of the permittivity of free space that be include in the rydberg constant equation thereby introduce systematic error by affect the rydberg constant value by use the level i would ensure that the diffraction grate holder be level in all direction i would reduce any misalignment and use a sharper telescope in conclusion our overall value of the rydberg constant be

technique and instmments use to experimentally measure the rydberg constant be fundamental in modem science spectrometry especially have a wide range of u range from large scale astronomy 2 to the characte1ization of protein 3 in this experiment we use a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp to view the balmer series the balmer series be the emission spectrum of hydrogen that result when an electron within a hydrogen atom drop down to the energy level n=2 4 use the balmer series of hydrogen be useful a the emission spectrum consists of easily distinguishable colour line of visible light call balmer line the wavelength of this emit light be call the transition wavelength by measure the angular displacement of various emission line from a central maximum we be able to calculate the transition wavelength for hydrogen with far calculation and the use of some reference data we calcultated rx we measure the angular displacement of emission line from a central maximum in the hydrogen emission spectnun this be do use a spectrometer fig 1 show a diagram of the spectrometer use far detail of the individual component be described in section 3. when light be shone tlu•ough the grate it be diffract by different amount depend on it wavelength a show in fig 2. a the grate be make up of many naitows slit the light that pas through each slit interferes with light from all the other slit this lead to mostly destmctive inte1ference however when the path difference between ray of the same colour light be an integer multiple m of 21t the light interferes constmctively to give a maximum

discrete energy level n define in the bohr model have integer value assign to them the most central energy level closest to the nucleus be numbered 1 with the n increase by one for each energy level situate futiher from the nucleus the nucleus of an atom have a positive charge and an electron have a negative charge therefore a an electron move fu1ther from the nucleus and up energy level it gain potential energy when an energy-rich electron transition from a high energy level to a low energy level it conserve energy by emit a photon fonned from the potential energy it no longer need in the case of the balmer series when and electron fall from an energy level n 2 to the energy level n=2 the photon emit often take the form of visible light after calculate a use 1 we can calculate r .. use

dete1mined use a colour spectnun cha1t set up the spectrometer and thus the experiment be a multistep process a prima1y task in this process be to ensure good focus in all the individual component to allow for good data collection we first focus the eyepiece on the crosshair next we point the telescope at a window and focus the camera on a building across the street the combination of the camera and the eyepiece lens creates an ideal telescope with the camera a the objective lens this telescope be mount on a rotatable platfo1m focus the camera at this distant arbitra1y point ensure that any object closer than this point would also be crisp and clear a any image would be fo1med at the focal point of the objective lens we decrease parallax e1rnr in our image by approach the telescope multiple time from different standpoint and check for parallax each time the rest of the setup be conduct with the aid of a sodium lamp in a darken room a hydrogen lamp overheats roughly fifteen minute after be tumed on a such we use it a minimal amount prior to collect data we focus the collimator to produce a sharp image of the sodium lamp that be roughly centre on the crosshair we then take a note of the reading from the vernier scale that measure the angular displacement of the telescope a it rotate around the grate table due to the darken condition in the room and the small size of the mark on the vemier scale we estimate a systematic e1rnr of± 0.03° in our reading of the scale another key factor of the spectrometer set up be to ensure that the diffraction grate be perfectly in line with the collimator so a to reduce eitor if the diffraction grate be even slightly misalign it would cause systematic e1rnr in our final result after take a reading on the vemier scale we rotate the telescope through precisely 90° and place a diffraction grate in the holder locate between the camera and collimater on the grate table we then rotate the grate table whilst look through the eyepiece until we saw a reflect image of the entrance slit there be partial diffraction of the light cause secondaiy maximum around the main reflection however the main reflection could be easily identify a the brightest band once the eyepiece be centre on the reflection we adjust the grate table to make the diffraction grate exactly ve1ticle this be difficult do do precisely due to the time constraint of the experiment use the vernier scale reading we rotate the grate table round precisely 45° so that the diffraction grate be in line with the collimator we then rotate the diffraction grate in the plane of it surface to create an image at a height sutiable for view through the eyepiece finally after lock the grate table in position we replace the sodium lamp with a hydrogen lamp in this experiment we measure the angular displacement of hydrogen emission line from a central maximum we use a diffraction grate with 300 line per millimetre a this give more intense nattower fringe and increase the number of emission line visible this diffraction grate diffract light more than the other available grate 78.8 line per millimetre a the slit size be closer to the wavelength of light when look through the eyepiece be three different colour visible line a show in fig 4. theoretically there be 4 balmer line in the visible spectmm however due to the amount of background light of the room we be unable to see the fourth we position the lamp a close to the spectrometer slit a possible to allow for maximum intensity of the emission line we close the slit to allow enough light through to see the emission line but ensure that the width of the slit be minimal we then rotate the telescope to position the crosshair on the first red maximum whilst ensure the telescope do n't deviate from this position we note the reading on the vemier scale we then repeat this process for all of the red maximum with order number between -5 and 5. there be more maximum visible outside of this range however they be dim and difficult to exactly position also the necessary angular displacement of the telescope for these far point be difficult to achieve in the anticlockwise direction due to the spatial contrainsts of the desk after record result for the red maximum we repeat the process for both the tm•quoise and purple a the purple line be often difficult to detect we open the slit to produce a wider more visible band of light this lead to an estimate ettor on our reading for purple light of± 0.05° a we be unable to accurately position the crosshair on the centre of the colour band we take multiple reading of angular displacement for eve1y emission line to reduce random ettor use the data collect in section 4 we plot a graph of order number against the sine of the angular displacement sine a show in fig 5. a the vemier scale give a value in degree and arc minute when calculate sine we have to conve1t arc minute into degree when inputting data for our graph we take the modulus of our negative value and combine them with the positive value to create few but large data set for each order number we be able to do this a the displacement of each maximum on the right-hand side of the central maximum be equal and opposite to that of those on the left-hand side combine the value produce a more accurate ettor estimation for the individual point plot and thus the decrease overall e1rnr on the gradient use equation 1 we use the gradient of each of the colour line in fig 5 multiply by the slit space to calculate a. these wavelength along with the accepted wavelength for the balmer emission series and original energy level of the electron that cause the emission 4 be show in table 1. show wavelength of light entitted in the balmer series the data for the universally accepted wavelength and the 'initial energy level column be take from previous scientific research on the balmer series 4 our ettor calculation combine many factor include misread of the vernier scale and misalignment of the cross hair on some bright band we take multiple data set and calculate an e1rnr on the mean of these result 0ul final quantize source of e1rnr be due to the diffraction grate not be perfectly nonnal to the incident light beam this cause systematic ettor a our• data be take over two session we be able to make an estimate of the ettor this cause the spectrometer be set up use the same method for both session however by examine raw data we identify a mean discrepancy of0.18° between the data take in session 1 and the data take in session 2. the calculate value for red be inconsistent with the universally accepted wavelength within the margin of e1rnr calculate there be many element of the experiment that retrospectively could have cause ettor in our collection of data and that may explain our value for the wavelength for red not be coherent with the accepted value the systematic ettor estimate due to the grate misalignment may be an underestimate if the grate be misalign by vary degree of angular displacement in the same direction great error would be present than that calculate to reduce this error we would have to take more measurement after carefully set up the spectrometer multiple time and take a mean of the result another cause of systematic error would be if the central maximum be not zeroed correctly this would be due to the misread of the vernier scale a discus in section 3. this would cause the value for the maximum displacement on the left and right-hand side of the central maximum to not be equal and opposite although there be some discrepancy in result either side of the central maximum we deem this discrepancy to be a result of random error and a such the systematic effect to be negligible random error across the experiment could be reduce by take more data the time constraint of the experiment only allow for the collection of three full data set ideally we would have many more once we have calculate l we use it along with the value for n show in fig 6 to calculate r ¥ for each colour use 2 the mean of these result produce a final value for r ¥ of 10887000 ± 74000 m -1 the scientifically accepted value for r ¥ be 10973731.6 m -1 this discrepancy with the accepted value for r ¥ be a direct result of the inaccuracy of our value for the transition wavelength our aim for this experiment be to calculate r ¥ with a high degree of precision and accuracy with a low uncertainty of just one or two part per thousand with careful use of a grate spectrometer this should have be achievable due to time constraint and lack of experience use the equipment we do not achieve this our final result be 10887000 ± 74000 m -1 whilst this value be close to the accepted value it be still not accurate within the range of our calculate error there be many different data that contribute to our final result each with it own uncertainty a such minimize error on individual measurement be a primary concern the necessity to minimize all individual error and precisely set up equipment be clear however occasionally this necessity be partially disregard due to time constraint a we take a lot of time focus the lens we have minimal time align the diffraction grate i conclude that this grate misalignment be the large source of error in the experiment although it be numerically estimate to be a relatively small value technique to reduce this error include a more precise set up and multiple repetition of the set-up should be implement with far experience and well time management this would be achievable our precision and accuracy could be increase and uncertainty decrease by take more repeat measurement for our data again this be achievable with improve time management we could also improve accuracy by use technology to prevent human error such a misread of the vernier scale a computer sensor to measure angular displacement would have be much more accurate than the human eye in a darken room,deep,the
49,GS_GYI981_Redacted,constant for all wavelength be relatively small around 2 for each meaning the result be reliable the linear relationship between the sine of the diffraction angle and order be prove graphically for all of the colour of light produce by hydrogen so the method be successful in prove the theory need to calculate the wavelength of the diffract light to improve the experiment i would have carry out the method in a darken isolated room where only one experiment be occur at a time ensure that there be a little external source of light a possible this would have be beneficial a with external source light it be difficult to see the spectral line produce by the diffraction grate and therefore it be a challenge to align the crosshair onto the centre of the spectral line by do this the uncertainty in the alignment would have decrease and consequently the overall uncertainty in the calculate value for the rydberg constant would have be small increase the reliability of the result another way to improve the experiment would be to take repeat reading of the angle of diffraction by for example both my lab partner and i take a reading of the scale for each spectral line this way a mean value could be calculate a well a the uncertainty in the angle this experiment have verify that the experimental set-up be capable of measure to a high accuracy by use data take from the set-up to calculate a know value to an acceptable degree of accuracy with small uncertainty within which the know accepted value lie,extended,bal
