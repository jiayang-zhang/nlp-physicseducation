0,GS_DHM538_Redacted,"1 2 to determine the wavelength of light emit from a hydrogen atom when an electron change energy level the rydberg formula be use within this formula there be a scale constant know a the rydberg constant measure to be 10,973,731.57m -1 1 when the electron be excite and drop to the energy level n=2 it produce a visible spectrum call the balmer series by splitting the light from a hydrogen lamp use a grate spectrometer we be able to see these discrete line of the balmer series and measure the angle of diffraction for multiple order so that the wavelength of each of these line could be determine from these obtain value we be able to calculate the rydberg constant for each wavelength for red aqua and violet wavelength respectively the rydberg constant be found to be 1.0963±0.002745 x10 7 m -1 1.0956±0.004296 x10 7 m -1 and 1.0939±0.002558 x10 7 m -1 all of these value be within a percentage difference from the actual value of rydberg constant by ±0.3149 n 1885 johann balmer first hypothesize a formula that predict and agree with the wavelength for the visible spectral line of a hydrogen atom the balmer series only 3 year later johannes rydberg present another formula very similar to that of balmer although it predict the wavelength of any energy level transition in the hydrogen atom in this formula the rydberg constant be first introduce now over 100 year later the rydberg constant be one of the most accurately define physical constant 1 in the whole of physic demonstrate the importance of this value and how far we 've come in our understand of the physical universe for this experiment the aim be to determine the rydberg constant by observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen through a grate spectrometer observe the discrete visible spectral line through a diffraction grate we be able to measure the angle of diffraction and order for each visible wavelength in the balmer series of hydrogen use the spectrometer by take multiple reading of order and angle of diffraction a graph sin v m can be plot use equation 5 and therefore the wavelength determine for each colour of the emission spectrum each colour corresponds to a different energy level transition in the balmer series and a a result the rydberg constant can be calculate for each of these wavelength use 2 where p will be different for each of the wavelength the rydberg constant calculate for these different wavelength should in theory be exactly the same however in practice they will only be approximately the same due to the error in measurement of the angle a well a random error occur in the set up and collection of data for the experiment the measurement will be take use a spectrometer which have an accuracy to ±0.5 arcminute which be extremely accurate however the actual error introduce into our measurement be much great a the reading of the data relies largely on human judgment and this introduces more error if a gas be excite it will emit a spectrum of light call an emission line spectrum when look at the spectral line produce by a hydrogen lamp through a diffraction grate only certain discrete visible wavelength be able to be see the hydrogen lamp work by passing an electrical current through a hydrogen gas in a vacuum small vacuum which in turn excites the electron within the hydrogen to a high energy level 1 when these electron drop back down to their original state photon be emit that correspond to the difference in the energy level that they have move between because of the quantisation of light give by where h=planck 's constant =frequency of e.m wave it be clear that these correspond change in energy will have discrete wavelength for a hydrogen atom the visible line observe will have wavelength that correspond to the balmer series of hydrogen these wavelength that be observe can be described by the rydberg formula where r be the rydberg constant p be the excite electron energy level initial state and n be the level that the electron drop back down to final state for the balmer series of hydrogen n be equal to 2 and all the line in the visible emission spectrum will be drop down to this energy level from this equation we can infer that the large the transition in energy level the great the difference between n and p the small the wavelength of the photon produce therefore agree with 1 for different series such a the lymann series the value of n will change the rydberg constant be a know physical constant that have be determine to be 10,973,731.57m -1 1 and be originally use by rydberg a a fitting parameter and only later be it discover by niels bohr that the constant could in fact be calculate use other more fundamental constant for this experiment the visible wavelength of light correspond to the excite energy level 3 4 and 5 with each respectively have the colour red aqua and violet determine the rydberg constant 224+9 this angle be essentially the adjustment angle and every angle measure can be take away from this in order to find the actual diffraction angle have set up the equipment spectrometer we be now able to switch off the sodium lamp and replace it with the hydrogen lamp and place the diffraction grate in the slot do this we be able to see the emission spectrum for the balmer series of red aqua and violet at different angle and order the diffraction grate have a value of 78.8 line per mm -1 correspond to a slit separation d of 1.269x10 -5 m. move only the telescope we align the cross wire with the center of each visible line and take down the angle and the arcminute value read from the vernier scale on the spectrometer my lab partner then move the telescope and focus it on the same point and take another reading this be do a to give u an estimate of the error in the angle a the vernier scale be very difficult to read in the light in measure the colour we do all of them in one go a to not miscount the order of the line do this we go in the order red aqua violet have collect the data for a many order of diffraction that we be able to observe the value of the angle be able to be process by average the two reading convert them to degree use 1 arcminute= be able to be plot with each of the wavelength able to be calculate use 5 for the red spectral line produce by the hydrogen the number of visible order range from -4 to 4 and the line of best fit through these point have a gradient determine to be 0.0517513±0.00012959 the gradient and error in the gradient be determine in python use the polyfit function and the covariance matrix produce by the data rearrange 5 you 're able to see where  𝑑 be equal to the gradient use d=1.269x10 -5 m we calculate the wavelength of the red light produce from the balmer series to be 656.7429±1.6446nm the error in the wavelength of the light be calculate use propagation of error with the equation 5 where z be a general function of variable x y … 𝜎 𝑥 𝑦 … be the error in the variable and 𝜎 𝑧 be the error in the function apply this to 6 you get the equation where 𝜎 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑 be the absolute error in the gradient in the gradient give u the error in  the know value of the red light emit from the balmer series be 656.28nm 6 compare this value with the wavelength we obtain it can be see that our result coincides with this a the actual value fall within the range of error for the red wavelength calculate from the graph to calculate the rydberg constant for this wavelength of light we rearrange equation 2 sub our value of the wavelength 656.7429nm a well a n=2 and p=3 n be always 2 for the balmer series we can calculate the rydberg constant for the red wavelength to be 1,096,319,4.18±27,453.07m -1 this give a fractional uncertainty of ±0.2504 the error in the rydberg constant can be found by apply 7 to 2 and rearrange give the general error in the rydberg constant a where   and  𝑅  be the error in wavelength and rydberg constant the know value of the rydberg constant 1.0974x10 7 m -1 fall within the range of error on the calculate value for red light  1.0963±0.00274 x10 7 m -1 this small error in the constant arises from the precision of the spectrometer when measure the value of  we take two reading and to find the standard error in the angle we use   ±0.5 × 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 where the range be the modulus of the difference between the 2 measurement a all of the measurement that we take have a range of between 0-5 arcminute difference the error in the angle be always very small use the propagation of error 2 the error in sin be show go be use the error in sin the polyfit function be use in python with a weight base on the reciprocal of the error in sin this produce an equation for the line of best fit and a covariance matrix add error bar to all the data point you can see in fig 4 that they 're extremely small and be almost not visible this be because through the propagation of error the error in sin mainly depends on the error in the angle which be very small due to the precision of the spectrometer for the red wavelength the line spectrum be also very clear this meant that it be clear to see where the center of the red line be perfectly align with the cross wire and in do so reduce the uncertainty in the measurement take by both myself and my lab partner however this will not have be the only source of error in this experiment when set up the spectrometer so that the diffraction grate be perfectly perpendicular to the incoming light there may have be many small error in the measurement take when reading the vernier scale this would lead to a small error in the way that the light diffracts a the wave would not be incident on the space perfectly perpendicular and a a result the diffraction grate equation 5 would not hold perfectly true although it would almost another thing that may have cause some error be the thickness of the mirror/diffraction grate if the mirror have an uneven surface then when we set up the spectrometer there would have again be some error in how perpendicular the grate would have be to the incoming wave and the same applies for the diffraction grate of course a with most experiment there will also be random error when look through the telescope the angle at which you hold your eye will affect how you see the spectral line and their position relative to the cross wire in order to try and reduce this we take the two measurement but to decrease this far we could 've take more reading a possible random error that may have also occur be that we may have knock the turntable slightly result in a slight change in the vernier scale lead to the measurement follow this 'knock to be off by a systematic amount for the aqua spectral line produce by the hydrogen the number of visible order range from -5 to 5 fig 4 and be clearly the brightest/most intense of all the spectral line visible the line of best fit through these point fig 4 have a gradient determine to be 0.0383581±0.00015040 a for the red spectrum the error in this gradient be determine in python use the covariance matrix use 6 we be able to calculate the aqua wavelength to be 486.7785±1.9087nm the error in the wavelength be found use the same error analysis a previously do for the red wavelength of light use 8 for the balmer series the know value of the aqua light emit from hydrogen be 486.13nm 6 compare the value we found for the aqua light to the know value we can see that the found value be accurate a the know value fall within the error boundary calculate to calculate the rydberg constant for this wavelength of light we a before use equation 9 sub our value of the wavelength 486.7785nm a well a n=2 and p=4 n be always 2 for the balmer series we can calculate the rydberg constant for the aqua wavelength to be 10,956,386.37±42960.77m -1 give a fractional uncertainty of ±0.3921 the error in the rydberg constant be a before calculate use 10 a the know value of the aqua wavelength be accurate to within the error bound it follow suit that the rydberg constant be also accurate a the actual value 1.0973x10 7 m -1 lie within the error boundary of the calculate value for aqua wavelength 1.0956±0.004296 x10 7 m -1 the calculate value of the rydberg constant for the aqua wavelength be far from the know value than the red wavelength this seem strange a the aqua fringe be much more visible when look at the spectrum through the telescope and so it should have be easy to place the cross wire exactly on the fringe the fact that there 's a high error and less accurate constant would suggest that there be a large deviation of individual point on fig 4 from the line of best fit lead to a large uncertainty in the gradient and through the propagation of error the rydberg constant this spread of value could have be a result of random error in the measurement a discus earlier it may also have be due to the point plot on the 4 th order m=4 here the value of sin fall significantly below the line of best fit and may have result in the polyfit function give a large uncertainty in the covariance matrix this value may have just be a random error in take the measurement where both my lab partner and i read the vernier scale wrong such a by half a degree finally for the violet spectral line produce by the hydrogen the number of visible order range from -4 to 5 fig 4 and be the faintest/most difficult to see of all the spectral line visible the line of best fit through these point fig 4 have a gradient determine to be 0.0343022±0.000080218 a for the other spectrum the error in this gradient be determine in python use the covariance matrix of the polyfit function use 6 we be able to calculate the violet wavelength to be 435.3076± 1.0180nm once again the error in the wavelength be found use the same error analysis do for the red and blue spectrum use 8 the know wavelength of violet light emit by the balmer series of hydrogen be 434.05nm 6 unlike the previous two wavelength the know value for the violet light do not fall within the error bound of the value we calculate follow on from this the result rydberg constant found from this wavelength be 10,939,172.35±25,582.01m -1 which like the wavelength do not coincide with the actual rydberg constant a the actual value do n't fall within the error boundary the fractional uncertainty for the value obtain be ±0.2339 this value for the rydberg constant be the furthest from the actual value of all of the wavelength we measure yet despite this it have the small fractional uncertainty in the value this suggests that the data plot follow the strong trend and the point be the least spread out from the line of best fit this strange contradiction could have be a result of the turntable be slightly unknowingly adjust between take the aqua result and the violet a we take the violet result last they would be the only result effect in such a way if the turntable be move and the vernier scale adjust slightly in the positive direction it would explain why the gradient increase a the positive value for the order would increase slightly and the negative one would decrease lead to a steeper gradient if the gradient be slightly more shallow the wavelength calculate would be small and may have be closer to the know value of 434.05nm another thing to consider for the violet light be that the line spectrum of this wavelength have the low intensity and be the hardest to see because of this we be not able to take measurement for all of the order with 3 reading that we be not able to see -5 -3 and 3. because this data be miss from the graph we do n't know how it may have affected the gradient if the point be there then the gradient may have either be different or the uncertainty in the gradient may have increase lead to the rydberg fall within the error bound v. conclusion this investigation have be to determine the rydberg constant use the rydberg formula 2 this be do by find different wavelength from the line emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp and measure the angle of diffraction through grate spectrometry and use equation 5 to determine the wavelength of each wavelength emit correspond to different energy level transition in the balmer series use this method we obtain 3 result for the rydberg constant for different wavelength of light that be all within a percentage difference from the actual value of the constant by ±0.3149 although the rydberg constant for the violet wavelength do not have error bound that fell within the actual value it be still extremely close and still a good approximation of the rydberg constant from the result you can see that the relationship between the sine of the angle of diffraction and order be linear confirm 5 and from the similarity of the 3 value calculate for the rydberg constant it show that the rydberg formula very accurately describes the wavelength of an emit photon when an electron change transition level within a hydrogen atom in order to improve the experiment we would have carry out the experiment multiple time take multiple reading at least 3 for each measure angle each time we repeat the experiment we would have set up the diffraction grate again so if there be any systematic error in the set up it would be eliminate by take the average result for the angle from the different experiment we could have also carry these experiment out in a darker room alone a there be other light source in the room which make it more difficult to see the spectrum despite a very accurate value for the rydberg constant have already be obtain it be still important to revisit old theory that be still very much valid today and continue to test them in use equation 5 and combine it with the rydberg formula 2 we be able to determine accurate value for the rydberg constant with small error within which the know value lie",deep,exp,,,
1,GS_SKD544_Redacted,the rydbe1•g constant which relates electron transition in atom to the wavelength of the energetic photon emit be fundamental to atomic physic we aim to determine the value of this constant to a high degree of accuracy and p1•ecision by utilise a grate spectromete1• to diffract the light from a hyd1•ogen discharge lamp the resultant emission spectrnm be obse1•ved and the diffraction angle of the spectral line be measm•ed to calculate their associate wavelength and thus the rydberg constant red cyan and violet spectral line we1•e obse1•ved with wavelength 636.0 nm 482.2 nm and 432.0 nm 1•espectively the value of the rydberg constant be determine to be 1.113 ± 0.019 x 10 7 m-1 meaning the accept ed value of 1.097 x 10 7 m-1 lie within the standa1•d enor of the measure value the precision of this result could have be imp1•oved by take more measm•ements and it discrepancy from the accepted value be deduce to have likely be the result of an error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate the non-invasive nature of spectroscopy which can be use to study any light source make it extremely useful in the identification of property of a light source all light source produce a spectrum where emission be concentrate at particular discrete wavelength and spectrum be specific to each element the consequence of spectroscopy have far numerous area of physic aid the study of object on scale from nanometre to parsec one such example be the analysis of the position of spectral line of the light from distant star to determine property such a their constituent element temperature and velocity l a discus in the theory section the rydberg constant be pivotal in the understand of these spectrum not only do it relate the wavelength of an emit photon to the change in energy state of the atom 's electron but it can be express in term of other fundamental constant by consider bohr 's model of the atom 2 therefore very precisely determine the value of rydberg 's constant work both to verify important aspect of atomic and quantum theory and to far establish the value of other constant this experiment aim to define rydberg 's constant to a high level of accuracy and precision and it result will show the extent to which this be possible in the laboratory spectroscopy u a lens or miirnr to produce a collimate beam of light and disperses it with a diffraction grate or prism the disperse spectrum be focus and view with an eyepiece a diffraction grate can be consider a n equally space nairnw slit with slit separation d. maximum occur where there be constructive interference and therefore where the phase difference between neighbour ray be m x 2rr 1 where m be any integer give that the path difference and phase difference be related by phase difference path difference x 2 2 and the path difference be give by d x sine 3 a show in fig 1 where 0 be the angle between the n01mal and a line drawn from the grate to that maximum the maximum be found at angle which satisfy the equation d x sin0 m x .l therefore a plot of sin0 against m for any set of spectral line of the same wavelength produce a straight-line graph with gradient equal to j.jd it should also be note that for a diffraction grate with d slit per millimetre d when excite a gas will absorb energy which be use to promote electron in atom to high energy state when an electron randomly fall to a low energy state a discrete amount of energy be release in the form of a photon accord to the define gap between energy state for a particular atom this amount of energy conesponds to the wavelength of the emit photon il a give by the equation he a 6 where his planck 's constant and c be the speed oflight a refened to in the intrdoduction section the emission spectnun be specific to each element since each atom have different gap between it energy state this experiment study the balmer series for hydrogen where electron fall from the 'nth energy level to the second energy level a represent in fig 2. this spectmm have eight defmed spectral line in the visible region 3 five of these line be expect to conespond to electron transition from the ninth eighth seventh sixth and fifth energy level to the second and emit light of a violet colour an electron transition from the fourth to the second energy level be expect to emit light of a cyan colour and a transition from the third to the second energy level be expect to emit red light 4 however the relative intensity of these spectral line widely vary so it be expect that observation will be limited to few line than those list the rydberg constant r 00 relates the energy level of the 2 initial and final state of an electron to it wavelength in the case of the hydrogen bahner series the transition wavelength be give by 1 a 7 where n be an integer which represent the fmal energy level of the electron after the transition the rydberg constant can also be express in term of physical constant a mention in the introduction section where e be the charge on an electron me be the mass of an electron and ea be the permeability of free space the setup consist of a hydrogen discharge lamp from which light ray pas through a nairnw slit into a collimator the collimate beam be diffract by a grate and the resultant spectrum be focus and view with a telescope the setup of the spectrometer from both plane and birds-eye view be show in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively fig 3 show the vemier scale of the spectrometer to read the scale take the half-degree mark on the low angular scale just before the zero value of the upper scale then read from the mark on the upper v emier scale where the two scale exactly align in fig 3 this be at six arcminute the sum of these two value after have convert the number of arcminute to degree be the overall angle in degree iv experimentalmethod a preliniinaiy test where the hydrogen discharge lamp be left switch on to determine it longevity show that the lamp would overheat and dramatically decrease in intensity after approximately fifteen minute since the focus and alignment can be complete with any light source an altemative such a a sodium lamp whose intensity do not noticeably decrease with time be found to be useful although a sodium lamp would produce a different spectnun the position of the zeroth order maximum be identical for all light source and be the only order necessa1y for calibration in order to take precise and accurate measurement it be necessa1y to fully calibrate the spectrometer the dial on the front of the eyepiece be use to focus on the crosshair for optimum result the focus of the camera should be at infinity this be impossible so the diffraction grate be remove and the camera be focus on a distant well lit object in the order of ten of meter away in order to find the point at which the telescope be exactly align with the axis of the collimator the telescope be rotate until a vertical band of light be visible at the intersection of the crosshair the crosshair be rotate to appear a an x rather than a '+ to make it easy to dete1mine the exact position where the band of light intersect the centre of the crosshair in order to precisely dete1mine this position the slit width be adjust to be close to it minimum a the band oflight be not exactly ve1tical screw on the grate table be adjust to alter it height the collimator be then focus on the crosshair so that the edge of the light beam be well define the value on the vernier scale be record at this position and the telescope rotate exactly 90° clockwise in order to be perpendicular to the axis of the collimator in order to then exactly align the diffraction grate with the normal of the collimator a plane mitrnr be place in the diffraction grate holder on the grate table give that a plane mitrnr 3 reflect a light ray by 90° the 45° position of the plane mitrnr can be determine a the point where the reflect light result in a vertical band of light at the centre of the crosshair this inte1mediate alignment process be show in fig 5. the reading on the v emier scale be again record and the grate table rotate exactly 45° clockwise this process ensure that the diffraction grate be exactly normal to the axis of the colliniator the plane mirror be then replace with a diffraction grate of specification 300 line per millinietre to the near millinietre a show in 3 the diffraction angle be inversely propo1tional to d so a diffraction grate with more line per millimetre give a spectmm with large spread of spectral line and therefore a large spread of data with the '300 line per millimetre diffraction grate in the holder the telescope be rotate through approximately 60 degree either side of the central maximum to observe the general emission spectnun this spectmm be sketch note the colour and relative intensity of the emission line the side of the central maximum take a positive for the value of m be ai•bitra1y but have to be kept consistent the positive and negative direction assign be show on fig 3 and fig 4. for a many order a could be observe include the zeroth order the angle in degree and the colour of the emission line be record measurement be repeat and an average angle for each emission line calculate the experiment be can-ied out in a dark laborato1y to eliminate a much background light a possible which would have inte1fered with the resultant spectmm the emission spectmm from the hydrogen discharge lamp appear approximately a show in fig 6. only three colour of spectral line be observe red cyan and violet give that the relative intensity of the violet line decrease a the value of n increase l it be deduce that this spectral line could only sensibly coll'espond to a nvalue of either n 5 or n 6. the intensity of the maximum decrease a the order increase to the extent that there be no third order positive or negative line for the violet light the central maximum appear a a bright pink-pwple colour due to the supe1position of wave of each colour and the dispropo1tionately high intensity of the red spectral line the angle at which the central maxinia be found be subtract from all measurement to calculate 0. although the vemier scale be accu1'ate to 1160 th of a degree it be deem unrealistic that the angle could be measu1'ed to this degree of accuracy a it be fairly difficult to detennine which two line on the low and upper scale be exactly align therefore an e1rnr of 6 arcminute 0.1 degree for each measurement be chosen since the final measurement of 0 be an average of two individual measurement the e1rnrs be add via the quadrature method since there be too few measurement to calculate a standard deviation to give an overall e1rnr in 0 of 0.07° this translates to an e1rnr of 1.22 x 10-3 in sin 0. a plot of sin0 against order m for the hydrogen lamp be show in fig 7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the least square method be use to dete1mine the gradient of the linear fit line which be weight by the 4 inverse of the ell'or in sin0 this gradient be directly proportional to the wavelength a show in 3 wavelength of 432.0 nm 482.2 nm and 636.0 nm be evaluate for violet cyan and red spectral line respectively to 4 significant figure the e1rnr in these wavelength be calculate to be 15.09 nm the value of the rydberg constant r 00 can be detennined individually for each colour of spectral line the result of which be show in table 3. it be also possible to plot the wavelength of each colour spectral line against a specify function of n a discus in appendix 2. the result of calculate the rydberg constant individually be show in table 1. since the value of n for the violet spectral line be undetermined the constant for both possible value of n be calculate i. the value and their uncertainty be quote to four significant figure error calculate with the quadrature method .. violet 1 corresponds to an electron transition from the sixth to the second energy level violet2 corresponds to an electron transition from the fifth to the second energy level the accepted value for the rydberg constant be 1.097 x 10 7 m-1 to 4 sf 5 the rydberg constant be expect to have the same value for all colou1 's of spectral line systematic e1rnrs would have contribute fairly equally to all colour of spectral line and repeat give some confidence that the violet spectral line diffraction angle have be coll'ectly measu1'ed give that the value of the rydberg constant for violet2 be also closer to the accepted value it be therefore dete1mined that the violet spectral line observe coll'esponded to an n-value of five this be deem sufficient ground to exclude the violet 1 result the standard e1rnr of the mean rydberg constant over the three colou1 's of spectral line be determine by two method and the validity and appropriateness of each ass the first method calculate the ell'or by quadrature result in an e1rnr of 194500 m-1 the second by calculate the standard deviation of the data to give an estimate of the random ell'or in the mean which give an ell'or of 94070 m-1 give that three data point be insufficient to calculate a representative standard deviation the large ell'or be accepted this result in an overall rydberg constant of 1.113 ± 0.019 x 10 7 m-1 to 4 sf represent a percentage difference of 1.46 from the true value the accepted value be therefore within the standard error of the measure constant the systematic error cause the discrepancy between the accepted and measure value could be due to an error in the value of the slit separation d. the option of a diffraction grate with 80 line per millimetre be also available but the grate with 300 line per millimetre be more suitable for the experiment a justified in the experimental method section this alternative diffraction grate in the laboratory be label a 80 line per millimetre but be discover in fact to have be manufacture use imperial unit and therefore have 2000 line per inch 6 this discrepancy could also apply to the diffraction grate with 300 line per millimetre which be use in the experiment if so a '300 line per millimetre grate would correspond to 7500 line per inch therefore the grate would have approximately 295.3 line per millimetre correspond to a small value of d. a small value of d would increase the value of the wavelength for all colour of spectral line and therefore decrease the calculate value of the rydberg constant however if this theory be to be apply the new calculate constant disregard error would be 1.096 ± 0.020 ´ 10 7 m -1 to 4 s f. lead to the conclusion that although other systematic error may be present an incorrect value of d could largely explain the discrepancy in the value of the rydberg constant an error in the value of d explains why the constant increase a the value of n decrease if the diffraction grate have a value of d small than 300 see 5 the value of sinq would decrease by a small amount due to this error when the wavelength of light be small this would result in the wavelength calculate be small than the true value for all colour of spectral line with violet line be the least affected the rydberg constant be inversely proportional to the wavelength therefore the constant would increase by the small amount for violet spectral line due to this error and by the large amount for red spectral line another possible error could be due to the diffraction grate not be exactly normal to the axis of the collimator more thorough examination of the data collect show slight discrepancy between the angle measure at opposite order where the expectation be that the diffraction angle would be identical this be especially noticeable in the red spectral line which could have contribute to the value of the rydberg constant for these spectral line be large than that for cyan or violet spectral line the value of rydberg 's constant be successfully determine by measure the diffraction angle of the spectral line produce by a hydrogen discharge lamp the accepted value be found to lie within the standard error of the measure value demonstrate the accuracy of the spectrometer a an instrument however a relatively low precision of 1.71 be achieve give that the vernier scale be accurate to the near arcminute or to 0.017° this be due to a large error in q. give that the error reduces by the inverse of the square root of the number of reading take this error could have be reduce by increase the number of measurement it be also possible that an error of 6 arcminute 0.1° on the diffraction angle reading be an overestimate a this be six time large than the precision of the instrument additional measurement would have also far detailed the error result from the diffraction grate not be normal to the axis of the collimator and therefore necessary compensation could have be make many laboratory condition could have contribute to the total statistical error the refractive index of air varies with temperature and pressure 7 so small variation in these condition would alter the diffraction angle give that all the data be collect in one laboratory session the temperature and air pressure be unlikely to have significantly change between measurement carry out the experiment in a vacuum chamber would have fully overcome these problem the high the intensity of the spectral line the easy it be found to determine their exact position due to the nature of the hydrogen lamp the intensity of the spectral line decrease with time high order be measure last for all colour so the accuracy of the diffraction angle decrease for these measurement to tackle this issue the hydrogen lamp should have be replace or switch off and allow to cool frequently and the measurement take in a random order to reduce the effect of this error in the conclusion section the presence of an error in the slit separation be theorise future experiment could look to test this theory for the diffraction grate with 300 line per millimetre these find would be extremely useful for future optic laboratory experiment a n-value of five be use for the violet emission line a discus in the result error and discussion section the gradient of the linear fit be 8.484 ± 0.136 ´ 10 -8 m to 3 d.p which yield a rydberg constant of 1.179 ± 0.019 ´ 10 7 m -1 to 3 d.p this be a fairly large discrepancy between this value and the value of the constant when calculate for each spectral line individually this be likely to be due in majority to the inaccuracy of a linear fit for

2,GS_EIW693_Redacted,"in the follow experiment the rydberg constant r be calculate use a grate spectrometer the angle of diffraction 𝜃 of the spectral line be use to calculate the transition wavelength of the balmer series for the hydrogen emission spectrum this be do use the grate equation the transition wavelength be then far use to calculate multiple value for the rydberg constant the mean of these value be calculate to give one final value for r which be 10790078.35 ± 23082.98 𝑚 −1 and be within 2 of the know value in this experiment we use a spectrometer which consists of a collimator diffraction grate 78.8 line per mm and telescope to calculate the rydberg constant a hydrogen lamp be use a a source of light we use our knowledge of bohr 's postulate and transition series to calculate the angle of diffraction of the balmer series we use our knowledge of wave and diffraction to calculate the transition wavelength this experiment make u use knowledge we already have to calculate an extremely important constant we calculate the rydberg constant a it can be calculate to a high precision and accuracy even while use first year lab equipment it importance stem from the fact that it be connect to many fundamental constant a can be see below in eq.4 a see in fig 1. the light from the source enters through an adjustable slit which make it a narrow beam of light the slit be position at the focus of the collimator the beam of light be therefore collimate and convert into a parallel beam this light then hit the diffraction grate which disperses it such that diffraction angle 𝜃 depends upon the wavelength of light 𝜆 and the slit separation 𝑑 of the grate when different colour of light enter the spectrometer they be diffract by different angle therefore green and red light can be see have different value of 𝜃. the telescope be attach to an arm that rotates the angle of rotation can be accurately measure use the vernier scale situate on the base of the arm the eye-piece have a perpendicular set of crosshairs that help in accurately reference and hence accurately measure the rotation angle a diffraction grate be technically a number n of narrow equally-spaced slit with separation 𝑑 𝑑=1/n between slit a maximum occurs when the phase difference ∆𝜙 between two ray of light of wavelength 𝜆 be an integer multiple 𝑚 of 2𝜋 𝑚 be know a the order number 3 transition series in hydrogen and the rydberg constant accord to bohr 's postulate an electron can orbit the nucleus in a stable orbit without lose energy therefore it energy be constant in that orbit and only change when it move to a different orbit an electron can move to a high orbit by absorb energy i.e by absorb a certain wavelength of electro-magnetic radiation it can also move to a low orbit by emit a certain wavelength of electro-magnetic radiation the transition wavelength can be calculate use the formula where n be the energy level of the initial state and p be the energy of the final state of the electron 𝑅 be the rydberg constant it have a value of 10973731.6 𝑚 −1 and can be write in term of some fundamental constant a where 𝑐 be the speed of light ℎ be plank 's constant 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of an electron and 𝛼 be the fine structure constant 1/ 𝛼=137.036 𝛼 be dimensionless the balmer transition series in hydrogen be when p=2 and n=3,4,5,6…this mean that the electron be drop down from high energy level to the 2 nd energy level the balmer transition wavelength be part of the visible spectrum the follow sequence of operation be follow to align and focus the spectrometer correctly so a to get accurate reading i keep both eye open the eyepiece be focus on the cross-wire so a to remove strain on the eye ii the camera be focus on a distant object 5-10 meter away so a to remove parallax between the cross-wire and the image iii the hydrogen line from a hydrogen lamp tend to grow weaker a the tube age and therefore it get harder to take reading during an experiment therefore a sodium lamp be use to set up the spectrometer and the hydrogen lamp be kept untouched till the start of the experiment iv the telescope which consists of the camera and eyepiece be align with the axis of the collimator the helium lamp be kept near the slit to illuminate it the collimator be then focus to get a sharp image of the slit on the cross-wire this be do without change the focus of the camera v the camera and collimator be align so that the slit be at the cross-wires and the reading of the two scale be note at 180°0′ vi the telescope be move through 90° to the point where the scale read 90°0′ and be clamped a grate of value 78.8. line per mm be put in the holder the grate surface be not touch a it be very fragile vii the grate table be rotate until a reflect image of the slit be see in the eyepiece this indicate that the grate surface be at 45° to the incident beam viii the grate be then rotate by precisely 45° to set it at normal incidence ix the telescope be rotate to large angle it be found that the image of the slit be not at the same height the adjustment screw at the bottom of the grate table be use to make the grate ruling precisely parallel to the rotation axis of the table this be do so that all the image be at the same height i the sodium lamp be replace by the hydrogen lamp and the slit width be kept to the minimum so a to reduce the uncertainty ii the telescope be kept so that the central un-diffracted image of the slit be at the cross-hairs and the reading on the scale be record this be the zero point and be use a reference iii the telescope be then move from the zero point to the right and then to the left the angle of diffraction of the three different colour line red cyan and blue be record they be record up until the 4 th order in both the positive and negative direction i.e for m=-4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 4. the red cyan and blue line correspond to the transition wavelength of n=3,4 and 5 respectively iv four reading be take per line two by me and two by my partner this help reduce random error and give a value of uncertainty for the angle of diffraction of each line the uncertainty for the diffraction angle of each line be calculate by first calculate the standard deviation 𝑠 use the scipy library on python and then find the standard error of measurement by use the formula where 𝑛 𝑖 be the number of observation in this case 𝑛 𝑖 4. v the average of the four reading be take this be 𝜃 𝑅 𝜃 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜃 𝐵 for the red cyan and blue line respectively three plot be make on python of 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑅 𝑣𝑠 𝑚 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝐶 𝑣𝑠 𝑚 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝐵 𝑣𝑠 𝑚. the gradient and uncertainty of the gradient be calculate through analysis on python vii 𝑑 be calculate use the formula 𝑑 1 𝑁 and it uncertainty be estimate a the manufacturer do not provide one discus far in section iv vii a can be see from eq 2. the gradient of the plot be equal to 𝜆 𝑑 therefore each of the slope be multiply by 𝑑 to find the transition wavelength for red n=3 cyan n=4 and blue n=5 which be 𝜆 𝑅 𝜆 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜆 𝐵 respectively the uncertainty of the various wavelength be calculate by add in quadrature the uncertainty of the gradient and the uncertainty of 𝑑. viii the rydberg constant be calculate for each colour separately use eq 3. where p=2 and n=3,4 and 5 for red 𝜆 𝑅 cyan 𝜆 𝐶 and blue 𝜆 𝐵 respectively the uncertainty for the 3 value of the constant 𝜎 𝑅 𝜎 𝑐 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜎 𝐵 for red cyan and blue respectively be calculate use the formula 𝜎 𝑍 𝑑𝑧 𝑑𝑥 𝜎 𝑥 a r be a function of 𝜆. ix finally the mean of the 3 value of the rydberg constant be found to give one final value of the constant the uncertainty be found by add in quadrature 𝜎 𝑅 𝜎 𝑐 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜎 𝐵 x there be also a 4 th line which be violet in colour and corresponds to the transition wavelength of n=6 the violet colour line be barely visible especially during the high order line and be therefore ignore discus far in section iv there be also some fade line of various colour in-between the line of the hydrogen spectrum these be ignore too discus far in section iv grate for student lab be produce by take a cast of a master grate this be do use a suitable material such a cellulose acetate when the cast dry it be remove from the master grate there be usually some shrinkage and therefore these replica be never a good a the master therefore the uncertainty in 𝑁 be estimate to be ±2 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑚𝑚 t j glynn 1993 the data for the diffraction angle can be found in section vii 3 rydberg constant cyan 𝜆 𝐶 𝑛 4 the data for the diffraction angle can be found in section vii the data for the diffraction angle can be found in section vii table .3. during the experiment it be observe that there be a faint violet colour line a part of the first and second order line this line be n't visible in the high order spectral line this line be that of transition wavelength 410.17nm and n=6 it be part of the balmer series but be barely visible a it lie on the edge of the visible spectrum very close to the ultra-violet part of the spectrum our cone our not very sensitive to this part of the visible spectrum and therefore we be unable to see these line past the second order there be also some random faint line of different colour in the middle of the red cyan blue and violet line of the atomic hydrogen spectrum these line be part of the emission spectrum of molecular hydrogen a the tube age the atomic hydrogen spectrum line become dimmer and the line of the molecular hydrogen spectrum become brighter james e. park 2002 this be why the reading be take quickly and the lamp be periodically switch off to let it cool the possible random error have already be state but there be also a few possible source of systematic error if the beam from the source be n't collimate properly the ray of light would hit the diffraction grate at various angle and this could lead to the ray be diffract at different angle than expect another possible source of systematic error be that when the hydrogen lamp be left on for too long the intensity of the light from it reduce this lead to the maximum become dimmer and the minimum become brighter therefore there be n't much of a difference between the appearance of a maximum and minimum and the diffraction angle of a minimum might have be record instead of that of a maximum systematic error could also have occur due to human error such a reading the vernier scale wrong the vernier scale be read use a magnify glass and due to parallax error the scale could have be read wrong it be also extremely easy to not align the instrument properly lead to faulty reading the calculate value of r be 𝟏𝟎𝟕𝟗𝟎𝟎𝟕𝟖 𝟑𝟓 ± 𝟐𝟑𝟎𝟖𝟐 𝟗𝟖 𝒎 −𝟏 the merit of this experiment be that a spectrometer be use which be a highly accurate device which when properly align have a precision of ±0.2𝑛𝑚 for yellow light it be easy to take a large amount of data use the spectrometer and this help reduce the random error in the value of the angle of diffraction wavelength and hence the rydberg constant this be evident in the final result which be within 2 of the accepted value of r and in the uncertainty which be 0.2 and be very small some demerit of this experiment be that it use a hydrogen lamp which tends to get dim and this could lead to systematic error there be a high chance of human error during the alignment and measurement process the use of the replica of a grate also lead to an uncertainty this be evident in the result a the random error be not large enough to make up for the discrepancy in the calculate value this mean that it be systematic error which be

3,GS_DAG780_Redacted,the experiment cover in this report be carry out to calculate the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy and precision the method apply involve use a diffraction grate to separate the wavelength of light from a hydrogen discharge tube and then observe the diffraction angle of the different wavelength use a spectrometer the spectral line in the visible light spectrum make up part of the balmer series for which the electron energy level transition be know therefore use the diffraction grate formula and rydberg formula the wavelength of the spectral line can be calculate and the rydberg constant can be determine the value we obtain for the rydberg constant be 1.0940  10 7 ± 6.7  10 4 m -1 give a percentage error of 0.61 which show the high precision of our value this result be within 0.30 of the correct value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 which show that it be also very accurate ohann balmer first discover an equation that could accurately predict the position of the visible spectral line for atomic hydrogen in 1885. he derive this equation empirically use measurement of hydrogen line in the solar spectrum just five year later johannes rydberg generalize this into a formula that could predict the wavelength of any of the line in the hydrogen emission spectrum and later it be extend for other hydrogen-like ion that have a nucleus with one electron the spectral line described by balmer 's equation be know a the balmer series five other spectral series for the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen be later discover name after their correspond discoverer there be more series beyond this but these be unnamed all of these series have similar closely link equation which describe the position of the spectral line a outline by rydberg 's general formula for all wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum however a theoretical understand of why these formula work do not arrive until niels bohr offer his model of the atom in 1913 1 in this model the electron in the hydrogen atom be say to occupy a discrete quantum energy level brought about by the electrostatic force between the electron and proton these energy state can be visualize a distinct orbit of the electron around the central nucleus the electron be capable of transition through energy state but since the energy of each state be fix only distinct jump correspond to specific energy can be make when hydrogen gas be heat to high temperature the electron will jump up from it original energy level to a high one this leaf the electron in an unstable state so it jump back down to it original position release a photon which have energy equivalent to the difference between the energy of the energy level each transition will always produce a photon of the same energy and wavelength so specific colour in the electromagnetic light spectrum can be observe and these line make up the hydrogen spectral series many model have be propose before this but bohr 's model be rapidly accepted because it be the first one to account for the structure of the empirical rydberg formula his theory demonstrate how the rydberg formula reflect the discrete energy state transition of the electron in a hydrogen atom bohr be also able to define a constant within the rydberg formula know a the rydberg constant in term of more fundamental quantity be able to determine the rydberg constant accurately by experimental procedure be significant because hydrogen be the most abundant element in the universe and it spectral emission line from stellar object be observe and analyse frequently in optical astronomy the aim in this investigation be to determine an experimental value for the rydberg constant which be both accurate and precise have a low percentage error the spectrometry apparatus use in this experiment should have a high accuracy which should theoretically allow for the measurement for the value to a few part in a thousand each energy level of the hydrogen atom have a define associate energy for an electron occupy that level these level be represent by integer know a the principal quantum number the far the electron from the nucleus the large the number at it ground state n=1 the electron be at it low possible energy level and be consider stable the electron can be raise to an excite state if energy be supply to it when the electron transition back down to the determine the rydberg constant use grate spectrometry j the intensity of maximum decrease with increase θ and through preliminary observation it can be quickly determine that the order of maximum can not be detect clearly above m ±3 therefore for each wavelength 3 order of maximum will be measure on either side of the central maximum even though the balmer series consists of 4 spectral line in the visible spectrum the shortest wavelength line be difficult to resolve due to background light and so be exclude the reference angle at which the diffraction angle be zero and the purple mixture of all the wavelength could be see be measure to be 204° 5′ where ′ represent one arcminute and be equivalent to 1/60 of a degree the reading for θ be make when the crosshair be center in the middle of the spectral line each line have a measure thickness of 4′ which contributes an error of ±2′ to θ. another source of uncertainty arose from the difficulty in reading the vernier scale and the error for be approximate from the variation in repeat measurement which turn out to be ±3′ therefore the standard error in the diffraction angle θ be estimate to be 𝜎θ ±5′ or 0.083° and this error be propagate to give a standard error in sin θ and hence the error in the gradient and wavelength could be determine a potential source of systematic error in this experiment would be due to the refractive index of air since the rydberg formula calculates wavelength for light in a vacuum however since we have no method for measure the temperature or humidity of the laboratory environment it be difficult to estimate the refractive index of the air other factor that give rise to numerous possibility for systematic error include background light slit separation error and defocusing or misalignment of the spectrometer apparatus during experiment however it have be attempt to minimize or eliminate the effect of these factor a much a possible so we can therefore assume that their overall effect be negligible in our analysis the standard error for the rydberg constant for each wavelength be determine a follow the standard error of the mean for the rydberg constant could be found from the standard deviation of the value a rearrangement of 2 show that the gradient of the line in fig 5 can be use to calculate the wavelength of the spectral line a follow the diffraction grate have 300 line per mm so the slit separation d can be calculate to be 3.3  10 -1 m. table 1 show the gradient of each straight line fit for the three wavelength of spectral line obtain from fig 5 their correspond calculate wavelength and rydberg constant value with all associate error the final value of the rydberg constant be take a the mean average of these three value give r 1.0940  10 7 ± 6.7  10 4 m -1 the purpose of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant r to a high degree of accuracy and precision by reduce and eliminate the effect of systematic and random error through the experimental procedure and use of apparatus the value of the rydberg constant obtain have a percentage error of 0.61 and be within 0.30 of the correct value of the rydberg constant of 10 973 731.6 m -1 5 this show that our value be both accurate and precise and therefore our experiment successfully achieves the initial aim set out for the investigation our final outcome be significant because it show empirically that the experiment do match and reflect the underlie theory propose by bohr in his model for the atom it have also show that the experimental method we use be reliable and reproducible and that we be able to carry out the experiment to a high caliber with more time and resource available the experiment could have be improve far by make more measurement to reduce statistical uncertainty and more careful control or consideration of variable that could have add systematic error to our result,deep,bal,,,

the gradient of sin θ against m graph multiply by d. then by take 𝑛 1 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑛 2 3,4,5 for red blue purple spectrum line respectively a plot of 2 should yield a straight line through the origin therefore compare the gradient of the plot to 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 verifies the value of rydberg 's constant in this experiment the hydrogen lamp act a a light source the adjustable slit locate at the collimator focal point confines the source to a define narrow beam the collimator ensures all the light be parallel and therefore strike the diffraction grate at the same angle of incidence this allows a sharp image of the slit to be view use the telescope when it be focus at infinity the follow step be take to ensure the spectrometer be correctly align and focus firstly the hydrogen lamp be place in the centre of the slit about 1cm away such that the most intense illumination of the slit be achieve and care be take to not alter it position throughout the experiment so a to avoid introduce a large systematic error secondly the eye piece be slid forward and backwards until the cross hair come into sharp focus and their orientation be adjust so one of the line would not be parallel to a spectral line this be do to aid take precise measurement next the telescope be align with collimator meaning the cross hair be on the slit image by rotate the telescope arm 90°and use a mirror the position of the grate table at which the reflect the cross hair be center on the slit image be found consequently when the grate table be rotate back 45° the diffraction grate be perpendicular to the optical axis afterwards the telescope be use to check outer maximum be in plane define by the cross wire confirm that the grate ruling be in fact parallel to the telescope rotation axis prior to take definitive data a selection of preliminary data be take one measurement for each observable maximum be record for the red blue and purple spectral line while take measurement attention be paid to prevent potential parallax error by view the perpendicular to the vernier scale arbitrarily it be decide that all reading should be take from the right edge of the spectral line the centre be not use because it would introduce an uncertainty in judging it position it be notice also that light from desk lamp and the magnify glass be affect the image view in the telescope to try to reduce background illumination we surround the collimator section with black card grate of 80 and 300 line per mm be test and it be conclude despite limit the range of observable maximum the increase resolution of the observable maximum provide by the 300 line per mm would be most appropriate finally observable maximum would be record for the red blue and purple spectral line twice each and 3 repeat would be do for each measurement the experiment equipment be set up and procedure follow a described in the experimental setup and preliminary investigation section for each diffraction pattern sin θ where θ be the diffraction angle be plot against m the order of the maximum and a least square straight-line fit be implement for example see figure 4. there be random error in the angle reading associate with the ability to read the vernier scale by sample several people different reading of the same value the error be estimate to be 8 arc minute the random error associate with ambiguity when judging the right edge of spectral line be estimate by have the same person take a few reading of the same spectral line 4 arc minute furthermore it be assume an error associate with defocus and misalignment exist and be about 2 arc minute to obtain the total error on the diffraction angle these source of error be combine in quadrature the variable of sin θ be compute by multiply the total error on the diffraction angle by co θ evaluate at each diffraction angle there be no error on m because it can only take discrete value in an attempt to verify the value of rydberg 's constant inverse wavelength be plot against the difference between the inverse-square of the correspond energy state and a least straight-line fit be implement see figure 5 the variable error of inverse wavelength be determine by multiply the error of the wavelength by the inverse-square of the wavelength there be also no error n because accord to bohr 's model it can only take discrete value analysis of the least square straight-line fit yield a gradient of 10.92+-27 ×10 6 𝑚 −1 the theory suggests if balmer series hold true then the fit should be a straight line through the origin whose gradient be equal to rydberg 's constant 10 973 731.6 𝑚 a percentage difference of only 0.5 implies linearity between the variable in equation 2 and verifies the value of rydberg 's constant moreover the accepted value lie within the calculate error bound signify the investigate do not incur substantial systematic error although the error bound be not optimal and change could certainly be make to decrease major source of random error and incorporate one not previously address in conclusion the experimental value of rydberg 's constant calculate 10.92+-27 ×10 6 𝑚 −1 have a small percentage difference from the accepted value of 0.5 thus i propose the experiment verify the value but that adaptation to the method could be make the high resolution provide by the 300 line per mm grate help reduce error due to ambiguity judging the position of the right edge of spectral line however high order of maximum be very dim meaning we be only able only record value for maximum of order ≤ 3. to resolve this i suggest use a 100 or 200 line per mm grate instead so we could obtain a great range of maximum and while maintain a high resolution another potential downfall be prioritise measure more diffraction pattern limited how small our error could be in the future we could instead take more repeat reading at each value despite prevent some background illumination the black card surround the collimator section be not ideal cover the entire setup with a black cloth would far reduce background illumination a potential source of error that be not confront be the presence of very weak spectral line due transition of molecular hydrogen that can sometimes be observe between the red blue and purple line this be problem because it can be difficult to distinguish from between the spectral line of hydrogen and molecular hydrogen transition at high order maximum to highlight it ramification the experiment could be repeat use a hydrogen lamp of different age

5,GS_NHZ839_Redacted,spectroscopy be one of the most powerful tool we have at our disposal today for research and be use in many field include quantum physic and astronomy it relies on the way electro-magnetic wave interact with matter and how different wavelength may be affected this set of experiment be do to familiarise ourselves with the spectrometer a piece of equipement that allows the user to see the different wavelength compose a ray of light on the first experiment discus in this report our goal be to determine the rydberg constant which be part of the equation describe the wavelength emit by a hydrogen atom the spectrometer be base on one basic physical phenomenon diffraction and interference when a wave go through a slit approximately a wide a the wavelength it get diffract meaning that a parallel beam will come out of the slit a a cone the interference happens when there be multiple slit or in the case of the spectrometer a grate with a large number of slit a show in figure 1 when look with a telescope at an angle θ from the grate what be see be a superposition of all the wave come from each slit in the grate a these wave originate all from the same source they be in phase at the grate and their difference of phase at the telescope depends on the difference of length of the path they be take they will interfere constructively when their path difference be a multiple of their wavelength and destructively when it be half the wavelength plus some multiple a show in figure 1 the path difference of two neighbour slit be give by d sin θ where d be the slit width in the grate the purpose of have a large number of slit be to create more discrete interference pattern and thus locate constructive interference more easily a a result of the above when a beam of wavelength λ be pas through the grate a constructive interference occurs whenever where m be an integer which we will refer to a the order of the constructive interference a such have precise knowledge of d and θ allows you to find λ and even more interestingly when passing a beam compose of multiple wavelength through the grate the constructive interference will occur for different θ allow u to clearly see the different ray in this experiment we look at the light emit by a hydrogen lamp unlike a common incandescent light bulb which emits a continuous spectrum of light through thermal emission a hydrogen lamp emits a discrete set of wavelength this be do by the excitation of the electron around a hydrogen atom when this electron go from a high level of energy to a low one the lose energy will be emit a a photon a the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom be quantise so be the energy of the photon that can be emit by use the formula relate the enrgy of a photon to it frequency e hν where e be the energy ν be the frequence and h be planck 's constant it be easy to see that the possible emission wavelength be also quantise these wavelength be give by where n and p be integer represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the electron r ∞ be the rydberg constant which we want to determine on the spectrometer the user be able to rotate the grate and the telescope with good precision the angle be give by a vernier scale with space of 1 arcminute we first setup the telescope to focus on a distant image a it would be receive a parallel beam and align it with the collimator wich would produce the beam use the crosshair in the telescope we then want to align the grate so we rotate the telescope by exactly 90 degree and place a mirror on the grate table we then shone a light through the collimator and turn the mirror in order to have the light arrive exactly on the crosshair at this point we knew that the mirror be at a 45 degree angle so we be able to turn everything precisely back in place to have it all align 0 degree everywhere we put the narrow slit we could between the hydrogen lamp and the collimator to obtain narrow ray in the interference pattern however we be meant to see three different ray compose the light and only two appear so we have to widen the slit when we take data for the third ray in order to have a visible intensity the experiment be do in this way the hydrogen lamp emits an orange light wich be compose of three different ray one red one blue and one violet and other high wavelength ray which we could not see for each ray we turn the telescope until we found a constructive interference note the order and the angle each time this would allow u to determine each wavelength and in turn the rydberg constant 4 data analysis when do the setup we align everything properly but instead of have everything to 0 degree we have an initial offset of 180 • 7 the width of the slit in the grate be d 1.27 × 10 5 the raw value we obtain be in table 1. figure 2 3 and 4 show this data when the offset be take out from equation 1 the gradient give u λ/d which then give u λ a d be know we found value of λ red 658 nm λ blue 486 nm λ v iolet 436 nm the rydberg constant can then be deduce from equation 2. for this it be give to u that the hydrogen atom always fall back to a state of p 2 and so these λ correspond to n 3 4 and 5. we find r ∞ 1.11 × 10 7 m 1 which be close to the know value 10 973 731.6 m 1 to estimate the error on the final value the error on the measurement be need first reading the vernier scale prove to be quite difficult with the tiny scale and the dim light so we take an error of ± 3 the ray have a width of 3 when look through the telescope so this give u an error of ± 1.5 the overall error on θ for the red and blue ray be hence give by √ 3 2 1.5 2 ≈ 4 ′ for the violet ray a we have to widen the slit in order to let in more light the width of the ray be 15 so the overall error on θ be ±8 ′ to find the error on the wavelength a the error for d the space in the grate be much small than the error on θ we only take the error on θ. the error of λ be then give by calculate it for each value of θ and then divide the mean by the square root of the number of data point a it be the mean of an error this give u σ λ red ±10nm σ λ blue ±10nm σ λ v iolet ±30nm the

6,GS_TCQ490_Redacted,spectrometer be use to examine the spectrum of light emit by various source such a star crystal lamp an so on it be a very powerful tool a it give out data on multiple aspect of the light we make an attempt on measure the rydberg constant by follow the grate equation when light be pas through narrow slit diffraction occurs grate act a many narrow slit create many light beam with path difference which lead to phase difference these beam interact with each other create diffraction pattern maximum diffraction pattern happens when the phase difference be equal to integer multiple of 2π phase difference path difference ´2p l 2p m 1 1 where m be a integer also know a the order number λ be the wavelength of the light a show in where n be the number of slit when another light with different wavelength λ 2 be also pas through the slit a different diffraction pattern with maximum at different position be add to the imige now have two wavelength it can be deduce that then where dl be l -l 2 and be very small compare to λ. the rydberg constant r ¥ be give by 8 where n be initial state of the atom p be the final state of the atom which be all integer when atom be excite electron move to high energy state however it be less stable so they drop back to their ground state with a release of energy in the form of photon for hydrogen their ground state be p 2 and the electron be excite to different state to give out different wavelength of light fig 2 the setup of the spectrometer first focus the spectrometer to an object very far for example building out side the window put the grate in place very vertically and do not touch the grate itself then line up the light source in this case sodium lamp and hydrogen lamp with the collimator look into the eyepiece and adjust the width of the slit to be a small a possible but bright enough for the light to be observable after that make sure the crosshair be in the middle of the light beam and also the zero order of the light have no obvious split read and record the angle ±0.001° on the spectrometer then find the -2 order of the diffraction pattern aline the crosshair with one of the brightest colour observable record the angle and then turn to the next order until +2 order make sure to only work in one direction in order to avoid backlash the grate spectrometer 2 i. result first we try with sodium lamp however there be only one colour that be very bright so we only checked for symmetry to ensure that the spectrometer be correctly set up then the wavelength of the two colour can be determine by plot d sin θ against m accord to 4 the wavelength will be the gradient red the wavelength for red be 2.04e-04m the wavelength for blue be 2.76e-04m compare the two result to the wavelength of red light and blue light it be quite accurate,superficial,bal,,,
7,GS_PUK317_Redacted,"the rydberg constant be an important theoretical constant that can be use to predict the wavelength of light emit by various electron energy change that can occur when an atom contain a single electron becomes excite and then dexcites in order to measure this constant a gas discharge tube be use to excite hydrogen whose emission spectrum be then analyse use diffraction spectroscopy three emit wavelength be found in the visible spectrum and be found to be part of the balmer series of emission because they be produce by an electron fall from high energy state to a state with a quantum number of 2. the rydberg constant be found to be 1.088 ± 0.007 x10 7 m −1 which be an uncertainty of six part per thousand t he rydberg constant be a theoretical constant use to predict the wavelength of spectral emission line the constant and it 's associate formula be base on empirical data rather than from a theoretical approach spectral emission occurs when an electron move from a high energy state to a low one and emits the excess energy a a photon whose wavelength be function of the associate energy change the prediction make with the constant and formula use in this report be only valid for a atom with a single electron such a hydrogen the rydberg constant can also be express in term of fundamental constant this show how precise determination of the rydberg constant can help to accurately determine other constant in order to analyse the emission spectrum generate by a hydrogen lamp a grate spectrometer be employ this spectrometer be capable of splitting a beam of light into it component colour use the dispersion property of diffraction grate by investigate each colour in turn and analyse the relationship between their wavelength the rydberg constant can be found the hydrogen lamp use a a light source in this report be a gas discharge tube fill with hydrogen at a reduce pressure and one end there be a hot cathode which emits electron and at the other end be an anode which strip electron off the surround gaseous molecule charge particle be accelerate by the electric field create by the potential difference apply to the terminal of lamp because of the reduce pressure they can accelerate to sufficient energy so that when they collide with neutral gaseous molecule they can strip off electron to create more ion or transfer some of their kinetic energy to the electron of the neutral molecule transfer them from a low energy state to a high energy excite state when these electron return to their low energy state the excess energy be release a a photon of light similarly when positive ion recombine with electron excess energy be release a photon of light in an atom electron can only occupy discrete energy level particular to that atom therefore when an electron be excite there be a finite number of photon energy it can emit to reduce it energy state each element have a unique emission spectrum of possible photon wavelength with hydrogen have the simplest because there be few allow energy change correspond to light in the visible range the wavelength of these emit photon for hydrogen can be predict by where λ be the predict wavelength r h be the rydberg constant and n and p be positive integer correspond to the initial and final energy state of the electron respectively for all case of photon emission n p a the electron be transfer from a high energy to a low one by find a range of emit wavelength and determine their relevant n and p value through data analysis that rydberg constant can be found the light emit from the hydrogen lamp contains multiple wavelength of light when it be incident on the diffraction grate found in the grate spectrometer the light will be diffract so that intensity maximum for each wavelength appear accord to where d be the separation of slit on the diffraction grate θ be the angle relative to the normal at which the maximum occurs and m be a positive or negative integer correspond to the order of the maximum from this equation it be clear that the amount by which these component colour of light be diffract be a function of the light wavelength such that the gradient of a graph of sin θ against maximum order be equal to λ/d this show how a grate spectrometer be able to split up light into it various colour in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to analyse the emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp the lamp be place directly in front of the slit opening in the back of the spectrometer with the slit size reduce so that the spectral line be visible but a thin a possible in order to maximise the resolution of maximum location the light that enters the spectrometer be divergent so first pas through a collimator lens which directs the ray so that they be parallel once they leave the collimator the light be then incident onto a diffraction grate perpendicular to the light path this grate have a slit separation of 1.25 x10 −5 m. once light pas through the grate each component colour diffracts so that maximum appear accord to equ 3 the telescope of the grate spectrometer can move so it be at a constant distance from and always look directly at the centre of the diffraction grate for each colour in turn the telescope swept across the area in which the maximum could be observe note the angle reading on the vernier scale resolution of 1 arcminute when the crosshair in the centre of the eyepiece mount on the end of the telescope be at the centre of the maximum line the movement be do in such a way that the telescope do not have to change direction in between measurement to prevent mechanical backlash the hydrogen lamp be switch off while measurement be take place to reduce an effect that the heating of the lamp my have and also prevent damage to the lamp the order of maximum can be determine by compare their position to the position of the central maximum which can be easily identify because at this point every component colour will also have their central maximum value of θ at each maximum be found by take the difference between the angle reading at this maximum and the angle reading at the central maximum use the relationship described in equ 3 the wavelength of each colour can then be found the value for n and p for each wavelength can be found through reason and analysis of the data primarily use the fact that if wavenumber 1/λ be plot on 1/n 2 -1/p 2 then a perfectly negative linear relationship with gradient equal to -r h be expect to be found once p and n be determine for each value of λ r h can be determine only three district wavelength of light be found in the visible range they have wavelength of 647 ± 3 nm 482 ± 0.5 nm and 431 ± 0.4 nm these wavelength be found from the gradient of fig 2. multiply by the slit separation d. in order to far analyse this data two assume have to be make firstly the observe light have the same value of p this be valid because change the value of p would incur such a large change in λ that it would cause it to fall out of the visible range secondly that the n value of the observe emit light be consecutive this be valid because there be no intermediate wavelength of light detect it can also be deduce that the long wavelength of light be emit from the low change in energy so must correspond to the small value of n. fig 3. show the cast of λ value on to various series of increase n if the cast be correct then the gradient should the vernier scale use to measure the position of the telescope this scale be part of the mechanism that allows the telescope to rotate about the centre of the spectrometer while the other element stay fix 2. the telescope with focus lens on either side the eye piece at one end allows the user to see though the

a single wavelength travel through the collimator 8. the path the telescope be allow to travel through this cover all the location where observable maximum cause by the diffraction pattern will occur fig 2. the relationship between maximum order and sinθ for each observe wavelength of light which be all show in their respective colour from this λ can be found for each colour use the relationship described in equ 2 .error bar have be omit for the sake of clarity be equal to -r h and the y intercept equal to r h /p 2 a can be see from equ 2 each cast have an associate pcc value which be a measure of how strongly the data fit a linear relationship and a predict value of p which be calculate by combine the gradient and intercept model the value of n to be 3,4 and 5 yield the high pcc value on average 0.16 high than with the other n value the be also the only set of n value that yield an approximately integer value of p found to be 2 to 2sf make the observe emission line part of the balmer series which support this be the with the value of p and n finalise it can be state that the rydberg constant be found to be 1.088 ± 0.007 x10 7 m −1 the uncertainty be estimate by combine the percentage uncertainty of the wavenumber value in quadrature this be comparable to the accepted value of 1.097 x10 7 m −1 which lie just outside of the uncertainty of this report this report be carry out in a darken room with no fluctuate light source such a outside light the body of the hydrogen lamp almost entirely shield the spectrometer opening from background light and the relevant intensity of this ambient light when compare to the intensity of the hydrogen lamp be so much low that it can be consider to be negligible hence any possible interference effect have be ignore in the data analysis while set up the grate spectrometer the angle between the plane of the diffraction grate and the incident light be set to 90 • the possible effect of misalignment have not be take into account because if equ 3 be expand to include this factor then where θ i be the angle between the incident light and the normal to the diffraction grate a it can be see when λ be determine from the gradient of a graph such a fig 2. θ i will only effect the intercept so will have no impact on the result in analysis θ i can therefore be ignore while collect result the hydrogen lamp be only left on for a few second at at time to prevent damage and reduce any possible build up of heat with could effect the data such a by change the refractive index of surround air enough that the wavelength of light be noticeably change cause slight deformation in the optical element due to their expansion under heat or by difference in refractive index be great enough to scatter the light so that the collimator be n't sufficient to make the light ray parallel none parallel light ray would mean that light incident on the diffraction grate would have a range of θ i and in accordance with equ 4 the spectral line would broaden and cause the uncertainty in the location of each maximum to change the experiment be carry out at room temperature however change in ambient heat or other atmospheric condition such a air pressure and humidity which be not quantify during the experiment throughout the experiment could not be control and be not measure hence the magnitude of any possible effect be not know v. conclusion the goal of this experiment be to measure the rydberg constant by invest the spectral emission of hydrogen use a grate spectrometer it be found that in the visible range the emission spectrum of hydrogen contains three separate wavelength which through analysis be determine to be part of the balmer series of spectral line the rydberg constant be found to be 1.088 ± 0.007 x10 7 m −1 in order to more precisely state this much more measurement would need to take and compile to reduce random error additionally a diffraction grate with a much small slit separation would allow many more maximum to be observe and far reduce error in far measurement the effect of change in atmospheric condition should also be investigate such a by take preliminary data at temperature and condition across the range that could be expect to occur during the full experiment to investigate the effect and incorporate them into the state uncertainty with this data it could also be decide if far step to control atmospheric condition should be take",extended,the,,,
8,GS_BOD369_Redacted,a spectrometer be use to analyse the emission spectrum of a sample of hydrogen three spectral line be analyse and rydberg 's constant be measure to be 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 furthermore it be show that the emission be most likely those of the balmer series produce by electron fall to the n=2 state from high energy level a second experiment be also conduct in which a spectrum be produce by a white lead nichia 713-3955 a continuous spectrum be observe and image take in order to discern how the lead produce this and the nature of the spectrum t he most simple quantise model of the atom be the bohr model of hydrogen in which a single electron be consider to orbit a proton bound entirely by the coulomb force 1 in this model we consider the quantise nature of electron energy level such that only distinct and discrete wavelength of electromagnetic radiation can be absorbed or emit by an atom these wavelength be unique to a particular atom or molecule and can therefore be use to identify matter present in object such a star or mixture of gas and theirs property in this way spectrometry can be use to study fundamental interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter in a similar way to in atom lead function by the stimulate movement of electron between artificial energy level within the lead structure such that the electron emit photon 2 thus information on structure of an lead could be discern by perform spectrometry on it emission spectrum figure 1 show how light diffracts through a diffraction grate where the path difference between adjacent beam to any point on the screen be give by dsin θ where d be the distance between adjacent slit and θ be the angle subtend by a diffract ray and the displacement between the grate and the screen for the wave to interfere constructively this path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength λ thus we find the relation where n be the order of the maximum an experimental set up like that in figure 2 be use circle graduate in degree with a minimum angular resolution of 1 arcminute the spectrometer be calibrate by set the telescope cross-hair directly on the open slit with a test bright light source behind it before insert the grate the telescope be rotate at 90 • to the collimator a mirror be insert into the grate turntable and rotate so that light be reflect from the collimator into the telescope at this point the mirror be at 45 • to the light beam the mirror be then replace with the diffraction grate and rotate 45 • to make it perpendicular to the collimator the telescope be then rotate 90 • back to face the collimator the diffraction grate use have 300 line per millimetre a this be the only grate which allow the m red ±2 and m violet ±3 maximum to be easily distinguish but still provide enough visible order such that a mean and error could be calculate measurement be take anticlockwise from the high order maximum on the left to that on the right in order to avoid any mechanical inconsistency that my be present in the device if the direction of rotation be alternate the high order maximum that could be see clearly be m blue 3 and m blue −3 with angle from the central maximum of 25.93 • and −25.08 • respectively in order to maximise precision the slit be close until the maximum furthest from the centre be just visible this meant that the cross-hair be always centre on the fringe reduce the error in the fringe 's position and that adjacent fringe would be less likely to interfere or obscure each other the high order maximum for the red emission line be 2 and -2 a any high order maximum be likely too dim with the slit at a width small enough to provide adequate precision the measure result can be see in table i where the error be determine a the minimum resolution of the spectrometer 1 arcminute instead of half that a the measurement depend on an initial measurement of the location of the central maximum a can be see the angle be symmetric around the central maximum but all positive order of maximum have angle away from the centre that be large than their negative counterpart this would seem to imply that the diffraction grate be not set up perfectly perpendicular to the incident light beam alternatively the actual position of the central maximum could have be measure inaccurately however this seem less likely a the inconsistency be a high a 0.32 • an order of magnitude large than the resolution of the device in the case of m blue ±1 the average wavelength associate with the angle in table i can be see in table ii error be calculate use equation 2 where σ m be the standard error on the mean s be the standard deviation of the value use to calculate the mean and x be the number of value use to calculate the mean the measure wavelength mostly align with those measure for the balmer series of hydrogen emission line on the order of 655nm for red 485nm for blue and 433nm for violet 3 there be a noticeable difference of around 10nm between the measure violet wavelength and the accepted one it could be that whatever error present in the set up which cause the asymmetry in table i be intensified at small wavelength a small difference in slit width and angle will have a large contribution to this small value of λ. the similarity between our measurement and those of the balmer series implies that electron be fall to the n= 2 electron quantum state from the bohr model of the hydrogen atom we find where r h be the rydberg constant for hydrogen n be the low energy electron quantum number and p be the high energy electron quantum number the full derivation of this can be found in appendix a 1 it be interest to note that this equation only describes atom or ion with a single electron a multiple electron will interact with each other however for nucleus with more than one proton the rydberg constant will have a different value scale by the increase in charge of the nucleus a it have be establish that the measure wavelength be most like those of the balmer series then n 2 and p 3 4 5 for the red blue and violet emission line respectively note that the energy level of the emission line must be consecutive else other emission line would be see furthermore a the the energy of the photon be described by where h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light a large difference in energy level corresponds to a small wavelength λ. for each of the wavelength an average value of r h be calculate and can be see in table iii this give an average value of r h of 1.09±0.01×10 7 with all error calculate use equation 2. the accepted value for r h be 1.10 × 10 7 therefore our measure value be in concurrence with this 3 it may be of interest to compare this data to different assumption of the n electron energy level a such the possibility must be consider that n could be high or low than n 2. a can be see the assumption of the n 3 or n 4 state produce line that be quite clearly not horizontal have gradient an order of magnitude large than that of n 1 or n 2. from comparison with other measure value of the balmer series n 2 it be clear that the measure wavelength be those of the balmer series however this be not necessarily clear from the figure 4 a n 1 and n 2 have gradient of similar order of magnitude although the gradient for n 2 be indeed closer to 0 it be not significantly closer furthermore the error in n 1 be significant compare to it value around 35 this be likely due to the afore mention deviation of the violet emission line wavelength form it expect value a such more data would be require to prove that electron be fall to the n 2 state a set up like that in the previous experiment be use see fig 2 with the 300 line per millimetre diffraction grate replace with a 100 line per millimetre grate and a camera use to take image through the eyepiece 4 this be do to allow the entire spectrum to be visible at once a see through the eyepiece so that it could then be photograph and the intensity across wavelength plot a nichia model 713-3955 white lead be use in place of the hydrogen lamp a scan 90 • clockwise and anticlockwise from the central maximum be make to give a qualitative understand of the diffraction pattern interestingly it be observe that the spectrum of the lead be entirely continuous this can be see in figure 5 with no clear vertical line correspond to specific emission line this be entirely contradictory to the idea that this lead work use artificial energy level within the material alone to generate light a a set of energy level span a range must be produce such that the difference in energy between subsequent energy level be small enough to produce a spectrum that appear continuous furthermore each energy level will have a different threshold voltage meaning that one could activate only low energy emission of red light with a sufficiently low voltage this however be not observe and the lead turn on sharply at 2.66 ± 0.005v a such it seem reasonable to assume that the lead itself produce a high energy wavelength for example ultraviolet and this be absorbed by a phosphor coat and re-emitted in the visible range horizontal line can be observe on the spectrum however this be determine to be cause by dust within the slit on the collimator block some of the incident light a far issue exist in that order of maximum high than the first order be see to overlap fig 5. two image be take of the spectrum with the camera centre on the blue region and the red region respectively this be do to hopefully remove some of the camera 's bias towards certain colour or object in certain position the angle away from the central maximum of the red and blue boundary can be see in table v and the intensity plot of each can be see in figure 6 and 7. interestingly it can be see that there be clear saturation of the detect intensity between a distance of 300 and 500 pixel on both figure 6 and 7. the wavelength in this interval correspond to the range 470nm to 520nm this fact alone implies that this camera be unsuitable for this purpose a either the detector or some aspect of it internal processing contains a bias towards certain wavelength in the visible a such in order to conduct this aspect of the experiment effectively an unbiased camera must be found and utilised in this paper a spectrometer be use to analyse the spectrum emit by a hydrogen lamp and a nichia 713-3955 white lead in order to discern a deeper understand of the structure present in each source first the spectrum of hydrogen be analyse and be found to contain three distinct emission line red blue and violet with respective wavelength of 652 ± 3nm 482 ± 11nm and 449 ± 3nm it be found that these wavelength be most similar to those of the hydrogen balmer series with the only measurement deviate from the accepted value be that of the violet measurement this deviation be likely due to asymmetry cause by error in calibration however far data should be take to confirm this from these wavelength measurement the average of rydberg 's constant be calculate to be 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 with the accepted value value be 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 3 far analysis be conduct under the assumption that the emission line see be not those of the balmer series figure 4 and table iv provide the predict value of r h associate with an emission line for a possible value of n. a rydberg 's constant should be the same for all wavelength the gradient of the line should be 0. it be found that the assumption of the n 3 or n 4 state produce line that be quite clearly not horizontal have gradient an order of magnitude large than that of n 1 or n 2. from the calculate gradient table iv it can be see that n 1 and n 2 produce gradient on the same order of magnitude a such more data would have to be collect in order to verify that this be the balmer series the lead spectrum be analyse and qualitatively it be notice that the observe spectrum be continuous contradict the expectation that the lead produce light in a way similar to that of other lead by stimulate movement of electron between distinct energy level a the difference in energy between consecutive energy level would have to be small enough such that it could not be notice this seem like an unlikely design instead it seem more reasonable that the lead be cover by a phosphor coat which absorbs a small set of high energy wavelength and emits a continuous spectrum in the visible an attempt at a more quantitative analysis of the spectrum be make use image take on the camera of an iphone 7 however on far inspection of the data fig 6 and 7 it be see that the camera or processing within the device contain clear bias towards certain wavelength make the data fundamentally untrustworthy for this aspect of the experiment to be conduct successfully it would be necessary to utilise an entirely unbiased light photo-detector or camera mount to the spectrometer telescope to maximise stability the rydberg equation be where r h be the rydberg constant n be the low energy electron quantum number and p be the high energy electron quantum state to derive this we imagine a hydrogen atom in which a single electron be in a circular orbit of radius r of a single proton the total energy e held by the electron can be represent by the sum of it potential and kinetic energy a the only significant potential be electric potential then where e be the magnitude of the charge of the electron k be the coulomb constant m be the mass of the electron v be the electron 's velocity and r be the distance between the proton and the electron next we consider the electron to be orbit the proton thus the centripetal force f c be described by from this we find for the energy of a photon release from an electron move from energy level f=p to energy level f=n where p¿n and n and p be integer then therefore where mek 2 e 4 4πh 3 r h be the rydberg

9,GS_OQP549_Redacted,in the experiment conduct we calculate with an error of three part per thousand the rydberg constant this constant appear in rydberg 's formula and relates the inverse of the wavelength of emit light to the fundamental quantum number of the orbitals involve in the emission we calculate the value of the rydberg constant to be 𝑅 ∞ 1.099 • 10 7 ± 3 • 10 4 𝑚 −1 agree with the accepted value which be to four significant figure 1.097 • 10 7 𝑚 −1 1 to obtain the data necessary for the calculation we use a hydrogen discharge lamp observe it spectrum with an optical spectrometer and measure the angular position of the spectral line of three different colour with respect to the central maximum we then compare the result for the light wavelength obtain by plot the angular position against the order number with the know value for the correspond fundamental quantum number for the hydrogen pectrometry be a non-invasive technique that allows u to determine the chemical composition of an object by study the spectrum of the light it emits to obtain spectrum the light emit be separate into an array of different colour that can be observe use a spectrometer this technique find many research application especially in astronomy the composition of a distant astronomical object can be deduce from it radiation 2 one important relationship in spectrometry be the rydberg formula which express the behaviour of spectral line and be found empirically the constant that appear in the formula also name after rydberg can be express in term of fundamental constant the most general formulation of the relationship be first publish in 1888 by johannes rydberg a swedish physicist who start his career a an amanuensis the theoretical justification of his work be provide in 1913 by niels bohr who propose a model of the atom with electron orbit around the nucleus on quantise energy level 3 bohr 's work show that rydberg 's formula relates the fundamental quantum number of the energy level from and to which an orbit electron drop emit energy in the form of light and the wavelength of the light emit 3 the aim of this experiment be to measure rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer we use a hydrogen gasdischarge lamp a a source of light and register the angular position of the light fringe use an optical spectrometer from these measurement we be able to calculate the wavelength of the different colour of the fringe and therefore obtain a value for the rydberg 's constant a diffraction grate have equally space slit that be parallel and identical to each other and give an interference pattern with very narrow maximum this enables more precise measurement of the angular position of the maximum than could be obtain use a setup with few slit a series of fringe call balmer series can be observe with a spectrometer if a hydrogen lamp be place in front of it grate the band of each colour correspond to the maximum of the diffraction pattern and repeat several time at different angular position identify by an order number m a show in fig 1. the order number the angle θ relative to the position 0 th order at which a fringe can be found and the wavelength of the colour observe be related through the path difference 2 for light of wavelength λ a phase difference between neighbour ray of integer multiple of 2π determines a principal maximum the relationship between the phase difference δϕ and the path difference δx be give by where m be the order number a show in fig 2. the path difference be ∆𝑥 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 2 where d be the separation between the slit of the grate combine equation 1 and 2 it follow that the relationship 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑚𝜆 3 hold 4 the rydberg constant s fig 2. a diagram show the difference in path length δx between two adjacent ray this distance be equal to dsinθ where d be the slit separation and θ be the grate angle a different expression for the wavelength be give by an empirical formula found by the swiss physicist johann balmer in 1855 later generalise by rydberg 5 the more general formulation be where r∞ be the rydberg constant n and p be integer and represent respectively the energy level of the initial and final state of the electron that emits the light the rydberg constant can be express use fundamental constant by look at the energy of the photon that result from the transition of an electron between different energy level in the hydrogen atom a described by bohr 's model the energy of this photon be in absolute value equal to the difference δe in internal energy of the two energy level involve and can be express use einstein 's light quantisation a where h be the planck constant and c be the speed of light in vacuum 6 the difference in internal energy can also be express in term of the energy of initial and final energy level the energy of these state can be write a the sum of their potential energy pe and kinetic energy ke and where e be the charge of the electron r be the radius of the atomic orbit me be the mass of the electron and v be it velocity 5 substitute bohr 's radius and the speed of the orbit electron see equation 11 and 12 in appendix into equation 6 the energy can be express a where n represent the initial energy level similarly the same result can be found for the final energy with p represent the final energy level the difference in internal energy can now be write a equate equation 5 and 10 rydberg 's formula can be write a therefore the rydberg 's constant can be write a the set-up of the spectrometer use in this experiment be show in fig 3. after focus the eyepiece on the crosswire at roughly 30 centimetre to avoid eye strain we focus the camera lens of the optical spectrometer on an object distant nearly 10 metre which be a good approximation of focus on infinity we then position the lamp close to the slit to adjust the focus of the collimator and clamped the telescope at 90° to be able to put the grate at exactly 45° use a mirror for this experiment we use a diffraction grate with 300 slit to minimise systematic error we make sure that all the component be well align use a sodium lamp that unlike the hydrogen lamp do not need to be turn off often to avoid overheat to be able to see the spectrum clearly we kept our desk lamp off for the entire duration of the experiment for the experiment we use a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp a the source of light we turn it off between measurement to avoid overheat we first measure the width of the central maximum a a reference value for the width of the spectral line to be approximately 4 we then take two measurement of angular position relative to the central maximum for each colour band we be able to see position the crosswire approximately on the centre of the fringe the error on these reading due to the difficulty to clearly identify the centre of very dim fringe be estimate to be 1 the error on the reading on the vernier scale of the spectrometer be of 1 we plot the sine of the measure angular position against the order number of the fringe for each of the colour observe red blue and violet we verify that for every colour the relationship between the two variable follow the linear correlation expect a show if fig 4. we be able to see three order of line for the red and blue light but only two for the violet one the three line meet in a common

10,GS_WSY182_Redacted,an investigation be undertaken with the aim of measure the visible balmer transition wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum in order to deduce an estimate of the rydberg constant r∞ this be do use simple spectrometry the light from a hydrogen lamp be pas through a 300lines/mm diffraction grate and the diffraction angle θ be measure a graph of sin θ against order m allow the wavelength of the first 3 transition to be determine and this in turn allow the rydberg constant r∞ to be measure to a high accuracy and precision the final estimate for the rydberg constant be r∞ 1.097 ± 0.004 10 7 m −1 this be in agreement with the accepted value r∞ 10973731.6m −1 to four significant figure spectrometry of light be arguably the most important technique in all of astronomy without the ability to analyse the incoming light from distant cosmic object it would not be possible to verify the theory of the universe on a large scale spectrometry have help to improve our understand of many area of modern physic for example the formation and structure of star and galaxy the study of earth-like planet and other stellar orbit object and our understand of relativity this report detail an investigative effort into the measurement of rydberg 's constant this be do use a light spectrometer consist of a hydrogen lamp and a collimator which produce a parallel beam of light this beam then pas through a diffraction grate and produce a diffraction pattern this diffraction pattern can be measure by a camera/eyepiece set up which be attach to a freely rotate table the measurement of different colour of light at different diffraction angle allows for the determination of wavelength and hence of the rydberg constant when an electric current be pas through a glass tube which contains low pressure hydrogen gas it emits light consist of various different wavelength 1 when this light be pas through a diffraction grate it be separate into it individual component wavelength which build up an emission spectrum an emission spectrum consists of a few bright colour line against a black backdrop see figure 2 these line correspond to the different wavelength of light emit by the source these wavelength be distinct and demonstrate quantisation in the structure of the atom in fact these wavelength be a result of an electron fall from an excite state to a low energy state figure 1 demonstrates some of these transition in hydrogen the transition demonstrate here belong to the balmer series which consists of the transition from high energy level to the 2nd energy level n=2 when an electron transition from a high energy level to a low one it release energy in the form of a photon the amount of energy carry by this photon be exactly equal to the difference between the two energy level the wavelength of this photon be related to this energy difference by the follow formula where e=transition energy h=planck 's constant 6.626 ... 10 −34 j c=speed of light in a vacuum 2.997 ... 10 8 m −1 and λ=wavelength of light emit the transition wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum be also give by equation 1 below here rather than require the energy difference between the two energy state the quantum number of the initial state and the final state be need this property make the equation incredibly powerful and work extremely well for hydrogen 's emission spectrum but can also be use for some large atom the constant in this equation be call the rydberg constant where λ wavelength n initial state of excite electron p final state of de-excited electron and r ∞ the rydberg constant the visible wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum the balmer series wavelength can be predict by set the final energy level p 2 and the initial energy level n 3 4 5 .... the first three balmer transition spectral line can be see in figure 2 below along with the expect wavelength energy level to the 2nd energy level these wavelength be in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to measure the rydberg constant via equation 1 the wavelength of each spectral line be need in order to measure these wavelength a light spectrometer be use this spectrometer consist of 4 main component a hydrogen lamp act a a light source the light from the hydrogen lamp be pas through a slit and a collimator in series to produce a parallel thin beam of light this thin beam be pas through a 300lines/mm diffraction grate in order to separate the light into it component wavelength a camera/eyepiece set up sat on table which be free to rotate about a vertical axis that pas through the centre of the diffraction grate by rotate the camera/eyepiece the angle θ between the central maximum and increase order maximum of different colour be measure the rotate table be fit with a vernier scale which allow the measurement of this angle θ to arcminute precision within 1/60 of a degree a simple schematic of the set up can be see in figure 3 below simple diffraction theory state that different wavelength be diffract by different amount when pas through the diffraction grate this be the reason that the component wavelength be split up to produce an emission spectrum like the one demonstrate in figure 2. the angle θ by which a particular wavelength be diffract be related to the wavelength by the follow equation where m=order of maximum λ=wavelength d=grating space and θ=diffraction angle this meant that plot a graph of sin θ against the order m result in a straight line with the gradient equal to λ d therefore by use this simple set up and measure the diffraction angle at increase order maximum for the various different colour it be possible to measure the wavelength of each of those colour and hence calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ via equation 1 the hydrogen lamp use provide a stable light source from which the emission spectrum of hydrogen could be investigate the dependent variable be the angle θ between the central maximum and the m'th maximum for each colour of light observe red blue and violet preliminary measurement reveal that the vernier scale on the rotate table be sometimes difficult to read exactly a it be n't always obvious which line on the scale be align perfectly also whilst each spectral line be relatively thin there be some uncertainty in the position of it center it be decide that to compensate for these two source of error an uncertainty of ±5 arcsecond be appropriate in each measure value of the angle θ. this be still a small percentage uncertainty in the order of 0.5 or less meaning that the precision be still high by plot graph of sin θ against m the wavelength of each colour be estimate by refer back to equation 2 it can be see that λ measure d gradient this be consistent with the data collect a the red line have the great gradient whilst the violet line have the small see figure 4 use this relation and the value of d 1/300000 m an estimate for the wavelength of each observe spectral line be calculate the uncertainty in the gradient of each line be extract from the the respective covariant matrix this carry forward the ±5 arcsecond error estimate earlier into an uncertainty in the value of the gradient since d 1/300000 m be constant the measure wavelength λ be only dependent on the gradient it can be easily verify use quadrature that the percentage uncertainty in λ be equal to the percentage uncertainty in the gradient use a rearrange form of equation 1 allow the calculation of the rydberg constant r ∞ from each of the three observe spectral line in this case p 2 and n 3 4 5 for the red blue and violet line respectively since p and n be definite and without error the rydberg constant have an uncertainty which depend only on λ. that uncertainty could be easily calculate in quadrature to be equal to the percentage uncertainty in the value of λ. the result from the first three wavelength in the emission spectrum of hydrogen can be see in table 1 below from these result an average value of the rydberg constant r ∞ be calculate along with it associate uncertainty use quadrature this final estimate in the value of the rydberg constant be this result be very accurate agree with the accepted value r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 to four significant figure the percentage uncertainty in the final estimate be just 0.36 which show that the result colour λ/nm r ∞ 10 7 m −1 red 656 ± 5 1.098 ± 0.009 blue 485 ± 3 1.100 ± 0.007 violet 436 ± 2 1.092 ± 0.005 table 1 a table show the measure wavelength λ and the correspond value of the rydberg constant r∞ from these result an average value of r∞ be calculate along with it associate uncertainty use quadrature be also very precise all in all this demonstrates that a very simple spectrometer set up can be use to make high precision measurement to far improve the precision of this experiment one could take more time to collect repeat result of the angle θ observe for each spectral line and hence reduce the uncertainty in the measure angle this would propagate into a small uncertainty in the gradient and hence a small uncertainty in the final estimate of r ∞ this would result in a more precise measurement accurate to a great number of significant figure furthermore one could change the diffraction grate use to collect data for different value of the grate space d. do this several time would allow the wavelength of each spectral line to be calculate multiple time and hence an average wavelength could be calculate for each spectral line which would reduce the standard error on the wavelength and propagate into a small error in the final estimate of r ∞ another possible improvement lie in the fact that background light from desk lamp and computer screen make it difficult to see any maximum beyond m ±3 it would be possible to reduce the background light to zero by conduct the experiment in a photographic darkroom and turn off all light source include desk lamp and computer screen during measurement take this would allow data to be take for higher-order maximum which would in turn allow a high number of data point in the sin θ vs. m graph in turn the uncertainty in the gradient would be reduce and hence result in a more precise estimate of r ∞ the reduction in background light could also allow the measurement of low wavelength spectral line by go beyond the first three balmer series transition and substitute n 6 into equation 1 it can be see that there should be a far violet colour spectral line of wavelength λ 410nm in the initial investigation this spectral line be not visible probably due to low intensity and too much background light however this wavelength still lie within the visible spectrum and hence technically it could be observe use the same equipment 4 this would allow an extra value of the rydberg constant to be measure and would allow the calculation of an average use a great number of measurement reduce the standard error on the mean value of r ∞ and increase the ultimate precision lastly the error on the angle θ measure at each maximum could be reduce by use a rotate table with a digital scale rather than the analogue vernier scale on the exist table this would greatly reduce the previously estimate uncertainty of ±5 arcsecond and hence reduce the error which be propagate into the final result again this would lead to a more precise value of r ∞ the aim of this investigation be to gain an estimate for the rydberg constant r ∞ use simple spectrometry of light this aim be successfully met and the rydberg constant be measure to be r ∞ 1.097 ± 0.004 10 7 m −1 this agree with the accepted value of r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 to four significant figure demonstrate the high accuracy and precision of the method involve with some minor tweak and more time the method could be improve to reduce uncertainty in turn this would lead to an increase the precision of the experiment and allow the measurement of the rydberg constant to a great number of significant figure,superficial,bal,,,

12,GS_ICG798_Redacted,we experimentally determine the rydberg constant to the same order of magnitude a the accepted value the constant be found by use the technique of spectroscopy on hydrogen a spectrometer partner with a diffraction grate be use to observe the hydrogen emission spectrum the angle of diffraction for the different colour line be calculate with a high precision scale hence the error be small the data reading for the violet emission line be inaccurate whilst red and turquoise agree with the theory for both wavelength and the rydberg constant have the same order of magnitude t he swedish physicist johannes rydberg devise the rydberg formula in 1888 to explain the observe feature of atomic spectrum 1 from this formula arose the fundamental physical constant-the rydberg constant-as for each emission spectrum he study the constant in the formula stayed the same 1 what make the rydberg constant special be that it can be define in term of other fundamental constant a will be show in equation 3 the rydberg constant can be use to work out the wavelength of an emit photon in an element from a certain energy level hence it be use in spectroscopy and have played a major role in atomic physic 2 spectroscopy have many application in modern astronomy such a obtain data about the composition density and temperature of a certain astronomical object 3 spectroscopy have be significant in the improvement of our knowledge about the solar system for this experiment the light emit from the hydrogen lamp be separate by a diffraction grate where the apparatus the light travel through be call the spectrometer the main apparatus use for this experiment be the spectrometer show in fig 1. it work by have a light source 's ray travel through an adjustable narrow slit follow by a collimator to make the ray parallel 4 the light then pas through the diffraction grate to disperse the light into distinct spectral line observe through the eyepiece a first postulate by niels bohr the emission spectrum observe be compose of distinct line since the different colour of light have different wavelength and so be diffract different amount 1 they have different wavelength a inside the atom after an electron have be excite it fall down from a discrete energy level give off a photon of discrete energy depend on the level transition 1 the combination of photon emit from different level combination form the emit light detailed draw of a spectrometer that consists of a collimator grate table and telescope it show how the light be collimate diffract and then focus the grate table can rotate a well a the telescope so that the angle between the grate and telescope can be measure the angle be measure by a vernier scale on the grate table 4 the spectrometer can be use to find the wavelength of the different colour of light observe by the relation of wavelength λ and angle of diffraction θ in the grate equation 4 1 the path difference d sin θ of the light

meet so at a phase difference of 2πm where m be an integer multiple also refer to a the order the phase difference path difference × 2π λ 5 so combine this with the definition of the path difference we get 1 the wavelength calculate in 1 can be use in the rydberg formula 6 to calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ in equation 2 4 the spectrometer be set up a show in fig 1 with the `` source `` be a hydrogen lamp the slit be adjustable in width and the diffraction grate have the space 78.8 line per mm importantly there be also a crosshair on the telescope allow the observe line to be measure accurately to begin we align and focus the spectrometer by complete the follow step we make sure the telescope align with the collimator sharpen the image of the slit and make the crosshair align with it from this alignment we rotate the telescope exactly 90 • with the use of the highly precise vernier scale which use arc minute to measure the angle between the diffraction grate and telescope the high accuracy of the scale meant the uncertainty on any rotation be ±5 arc minute which approximates to ±0.08 • the rotation meant an accurate measurement of 45 • between the grate and incident beam could be found by align the grate so that the slit image fell on the crosshair finally the grate be rotate back 45 • to make sure the grate be set to 0 • incidence angle with the spectrometer calibrate we then measure the angle of diffraction from the central spectral line for the four observe colour in the hydrogen emission spectrum the central line have order m 0 so we take reading with increase order to one side of the line and decrease order to the other we take reading of the angle a a function of m for nine order four on each side and repeat the next set of result with a different observer my lab partner in order to reduce the subjective random error throughout the experiment we make sure to switch off the hydrogen lamp between reading in order to reduce the risk of it overheat despite this for the first lab session our lamp seem very hot we think that this along with our lamp be less intense in the colour magenta result in u not be able to see the blue and violet emission line for this first set of result due to the weaker lamp light it be also harder to see the crosshair and thus accurately align the emission lines-increasing the uncertainty for the second set of data reading the lamp be more intense in colour which meant we could take reading for three colour rather than two with the crosshair also be more visible plot the order m against the sine of the angle in radian give the graph in fig 3. the measure angle have to first be process by take the m 0 angle a zero thus subtract this value from the other angle and then convert the angle to radian a see in fig 3 we be unable to get reading fig 3. graph show the plot of order m against the sin of the angle for the three different colour wavelength red turquoise violet in the graph the red emission line produce the steepest gradient follow by the violet and then turquoise for the blue colour line in hydrogen 's emission spectrum n 5 the line of this colour be too faint to be observe even if we increase the slit width to allow more light through the error bar on the graph be very small not encompass the line of best fit for the respective wavelength our error be found by standard error propagation of sin θ. hence we be not quite sure why they be so small however we think it could be due to the high precision of the equipment a predict by theory in 1 we obtain straight line for each wavelength in the graph and they all cross around the point 0 0 the value of the gradient equal their respective wavelength multiply by the slit separation where the slit separation be 1mm/78.8 line and the uncertainty on the wavelength be calculate from the uncertainty in the gradient table show that the red and turquoise wavelength be both in the same order of magnitude a their accepted wavelength however the range of their uncertainty do n't include these value this again show how the calculate uncertainty be small than they should have be with such precise equipment we estimate our error in subjectivity by find the error in our observe line width the large value of the error on the line width and the half range of our data reading be take for error propagation our value for the wavelength of the violet light be highly inaccurate this be show by the violet wavelength be calculate a longer than the turquoise wavelength and in fig 3 it have a steeper gradient than turquoise the order of gradient steepness should have be red turquoise violet this inaccuracy of the violet wavelength make it hard to calculate the rydberg constant from rearrange 2 to plot 1 λ against 1 n 2 a a result of the inaccuracy there be no clear straight line relationship in fig 4 thus the gradient of the negative rydberg constant be not able to be calculate accurately if only the data for the turquoise and red spectrum line be use the rydberg constant be calculate a 1 × 10 7 m −1 show how these colour be more accurate a this agree with the accepted value to one significant figure naturally use two point for a line of best fit be not very reliable hence it be unfortunate that we be unable to get reading for the dark blue line to increase the accuracy of the line in fig 4. there be also not the possibility to work out the error on the line of best fit a the covariant matrix need more data point to find the rydberg constant we therefore found the r ∞ for each wavelength individually and then take the average we decide to include the value for the constant calculate with the violet data a we be not sure of the main error on it the error on the constant be calculate by standard error propagation our experimentally determine rydberg constant be calculate a with the same order of magnitude a the accepted value in 4 despite the error in our violet wavelength again the error here be very small thus not include the accepted value within the error limit we believe that the error in our violet line reading be not due to external condition such a temperature air pressure or humidity a this would have be the case for all line colour they could however have contribute a a systematic error to all wavelength since they be longer than theory we think the violet line reading could have be inaccurate due to the line become defocussed or the colour of the line not be clear enough to distinguish properly for this colour when conduct the experiment it be at time not clear if the line be the strongly define line suppose to be measure rather than a faint blue line or background colour our inaccurate measurement could also have be cause by the hydrogen lamp a it have a weaker pigment colour emit in comparison to other lamp the defocus could have occur when the the slit width be adjust to allow more light in this experiment aim to determine the rydberg constant by examine the emission spectrum of hydrogen it be conduct by the use of a spectrometer where the light from the hydrogen lamp travel through a diffraction grate the data for the angle of diffraction against order for the three observe colour be process to find the rydberg constant via the grate equation and rydberg formula our result be within the same magnitude of order a the accepted value for the constant we have a very small error on our data which meant it range do not include the accepted constant value our value for the violet wavelength be inaccurate and we be unable to take reading for the dark blue emission line a they be too faint we learnt how to use the vernier scale for the high accurate measurement of angle and how to set up the spectrometer to improve the experiment i would conduct it in a completely dark room without other people present so that their desk lamp would not affect my reading and to improve my chance of see the dark blue emission line i would also

13,GS_YMJ516_Redacted,spectrometry be the science of study the emission and absorption spectrum of object the application of spectrometry range from determine the composition of a star to medical image the reason spectrometry can be use to determine the composition of a star be that each element emits a characteristic spectrum that can be extract from a more complicate spectrum such a that of a blackbody hydrogen when excite emits a line spectrum of discrete wavelength one series of these line be the balmer series which contains all transition to the n 2 energy level from high energy level much of this series be in the visible region of electromagnetic radiation so it can be observe by eye with a spectrometer by find the angular position of the maximum of the spectrum and make use of the grate equation it be possible to calculate accurate value for the wavelength of photon emit when electron fall to the n 2 state with these wavelength a graph can be plot make use of the rydberg equation from which a value for the rydberg constant can be found the rydberg constant be interest in that it can be describe a a combination of other more fundamental constant a good method for properly observe the spectrum of hydrogen be to have it ionise in a gas discharge lamp and then reading the line spectrum emit by the lamp splitting the line which make up the spectrum by use a diffraction grate spectrometer be highly accurate device and a such this method for investigate the rydberg constant can produce very accurate result a long a error be properly account for in the rutherford-bohr model of the atom 1 electron orbit the nucleus in discrete trajectory or energy level if a bound electron be provide with a specific amount of energy it will be excite to a high energy level the electron will then fall to a low energy level and a photon of discrete energy equal to the difference in the two energy level will be emit from the atom 1 while this model do n't well explain feature like the relative intensity of spectral line it do well explain the discrete wavelength of emit photon so it 's sufficient for this investigation grate spectrometer this effect can be observe in a gas by excite the electron of the gas and then use a diffraction grate to split the emit radiation into it constituent wavelength once the radiation have be diffract the angular position θ of the m th maximum where diffract ray interfere constructively for the wavelength λ be determine by 𝑚𝜆 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 1 for a diffraction grate with a line space of d metre transition wavelength for hydrogen can also be calculate use the rydberg equation where r∞ be the rydberg constant with a value of 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 1 n be the initial energy state of the excite electron and p be it final energy state here the medium that the radiation propagates through be approximate to a vacuum and the mass of the hydrogen nucleus be approximate to infinity in comparison to that of an electron a indicate by the symbol for the rydberg constant 2 the balmer series of transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by 2 with p 2 n 2 and n ϵ z. the first 6 of these wavelength be formally within the visible spectrum 3 method before measurement could be take the spectrometer be calibrate this involve first focus the eyepiece lens on the crosshair and then focus the crosshair onto a distant object while this should have be an object 'at infinity since the object be observe be on the atomic scale focus on a ruler 10 m away be sufficient the telescope camera and eyepiece lens be then align with the collimator without a diffraction grate in place and the collimator be focus onto a sodium gas-discharge lamp these lamp function by use an electric field to accelerate excite gas cation into noble gas atom which result in the cation gain an electron that then fall to a low energy level emit a photon of discrete energy it be this phenomenon that creates the balmer series which be be analyse there be another phenomenon that contributes to the emission spectrum of the gas which be incandescence this phenomenon have a great effect at high temperature and since the lamp operates at a high current this heating effect will be more significant the longer the lamp be operate for this reason the hydrogen lamp be not use to calibrate the spectrometer use the vernier scale on the spectrometer which have a resolution of 1 4 and be divide into third of a degree the telescope be rotate though 90º a grate of 78.8 line per mm 5 be then place in the holder vertically to ensure that the emission line would all be on the line swept out by the rotate telescope the grate be rotate through 45° and the height of the grate table be alter so that the sodium lamp 's central maximum be precisely at the crosshair with this do the grate be rotate back through 45° and the telescope be align back in line with the collimator the sodium lamp be then replace with the hydrogen lamp and measurement be take the angular position of the zero th order maximum be record a 135.43º all the follow maximum be measure relative to this zero point to find the angular position θ of the spectral line the grate be first observe directly to find the rough position of the line to where move use the fine adjustment knob to exactly align the emission line with the crosshair the angle be measure use the vernier scale with two independent measurement from two different observer this reduces the uncertainty in the angular position a the mean of the two point be take also the scale be read from above to avoid parallax error in the angle when the balmer series be observe emission line of colour red aqua and blue could be see for each colour the position of multiple maximum be record include negative maximum on the other side of the zero point this meant in total 6 maximum be record for the red aqua and blue wavelength every 6 measurement the lamp be turn off to cool and reduce it incandescence this ensure that the spectral line remain sharp with these measurement take mean value of each wavelength be calculate use the grate equation 1 and use 2 they be plot on a graph to determine a value for 𝑅 ∞ to verify that the data agrees with 1 the sine of the mean angular position of each maximum be plot against the maximum 's order the resolution of the vernier scale be 𝜋 10800 rad and measurement be take over 6 maximum where each measurement be repeat twice independently this result in the uncertainty σθ ± 2.42 × 10 −5 rad from this the uncertainty in each wavelength can be found a the uncertainty in the grate space can be assume to be negligible these wavelength be then use to plot figure 4 analysis of figure 4 provide a value of 1.099 ± 0.044 × 10 7 𝑚 −1 for the rydberg constant the accepted value of 1.097× 10 7 m -1 5 lie within this range which mean that the data be consistent with both the grate equation 1 and the rydberg equation 2 one potential source of error be the humidity of the air a discus 2 be dependent on the assumption that the medium between the source and the observer can be approximate to a vacuum however when the experiment be conduct the room be especially humid and warm which could well have interfere with the spectrum emit from the hydrogen lamp affect the result of the experiment additionally the balmer series of hydrogen include more discrete wavelength than the three measure in this investigation these other wavelength be in the upper band of the visible region verge on ultraviolet radiation which mean they will have be difficult to observe with the naked eye collect data for these line spectrum may well have lead to a more accurate value for 𝑅 ∞ another way uncertainty could have be reduce be if more than the first 3 maximum have be observable for the wavelength see they be likely invisible because their low intensity meant that the background light of the lab or the incandescence effect drown them out the aim of this investigation be to calculate a value for the rydberg constant the method use involve find the angular position of the maximum of multiple colour of the line spectrum of hydrogen a view through a grate spectrometer use the rydberg equation 2 to calculate 𝑅 ∞ the calculate value be 1.099 × 10 7 ± 0.044 𝑚 −1 which agrees with the model described by 2 this experiment could provide even more accurate value for the rydberg constant in a dry cool environment where many more reading be take with different equipment it would be possible to study the spectrum outside of the visible range which would provide more data to be analyse,superficial,the,,,
14,GS_BMS328_Redacted,where r be the rydberg constant and be approximately equal to 1.097x10 7 m -1 and n1 and n2 be integer value and be equivalent to the initial and final state the rydberg constant can also be express a r ømc 2h where ø be the fine structure constant a dimensionless quantity 6 m be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be plank 's constant another important piece of theory to consider be the balmer series the balmer series be a series of line from the hydrogen emission spectrum cause by electron fall from the nth energy level to the principle quantum number 2 7 for instance the transition from energy level 3 to energy level 2 will appear red on the em spectrum 4- 2 will appear cyan in colour and transition 5- 2 will appear blue 8 use the balmer series therefore allows u to optically record and measure the diffraction scatter a 4 of the transition of n appear in the visible spectrum figure 2 illustrates different type of emission and absorption series include the balmer series it be clear to see that those transition in the lyman series will need considerably more energy to be able to transition to the other n band all the line in the lyman series be in the ultraviolet band and thus be not suitable for our investigation 10 the other series adjacent to the balmer series be the paschen series these transition will have less energy than the balmer transition and thus all the paschen line lie in the infrared band 11 a you move through the series the rate at which the wavelength increase decrease until you reach the convergence limit of the series this be in effect the energy need to ionize the hydrogen atom the figure below illustrates the most important part of the set up two type of discharge lamp be use in this investigation be compose of hydrogen and sodium the sodium lamp be use for the calibration of the spectrometer whereas the hydrogen lamp be use for the actual record the sodium lamp initially emit lilac light and then turn to an orange colour the hydrogen lamp use in this experiment produce a lot of heat which would significantly affect the operation time thus the hydrogen lamp be only use for the record whereas the sodium lamp could operate for long period of time this become one of the key consideration a all measurement would have to be take before the lamp overheat this would require an efficient way of record result after the source we have the slit ideally the slit should be a narrow a possible to make the angle measurement a precise a possible another part of the fix spectrometer be the collimator a collimator essentially produce a beam of parallel ray which be useful for when you want the wave to converge on the same focal point the grate use in this investigation have 300 line per mm the logic behind use a diffraction grate with more slit be the fact that these extra slit would reinforce the diffraction pattern make them more visible especially at the high order 13 the set up of the spectrometer be a lengthy one however this get easy over time the set up begin with the focus of the eyepiece on the crosswire this be do from about 5 meter ideally this should be do from an infinite distance 14 in this case a lamp on the other desk be focus on one consideration be to keep both eye open whilst focus the camera now the telescope have to be align with the axis of the collimator this could be do by very slightly opening the slit with the sodium lamp fully lit behind it now once the collimator be perfectly align with the telescope use the slow-motion drive on the side of the spectrometer stage the collimator be focus until a sharp image appear the cross wire be rotate by π 4 to ensue that the alignment of the stage could be a precise a possible carefully record the angle at which the main stage be rotate and the angle present on the two main scale be an essential part of the experiment a precision be require the main stage be initially move to an angle of 59.5 degree and 2 arc minute two arc minute be the equivalent of .03 of a degree it become essential to be able to quickly convert these reading of arc minute into the more useful degree now the telescope have to be move through exactly 90 degree it be very helpful to get a second opinion on the angle measurement and reach a consensus then the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit on the grate come from the collimator be see this should be at 45 degree to the normal of the spectrometer additionally the use of a mirror to double check the reflection from the collimator prove very useful the reading on the scale must be take down in the case of our set up the reading come out a 68 degree and 20 arc minute now the grate stage must be firmly fix to the main fine motor and this whole set up be move through 45 degree so that the grate be at the normal incidence when the grate stage be in place the grate stage can be move by turn 3 different screw which adjust the height of the main stage to ensure that when move through the angle of 6 figure 2 9 figure 3 12 observation all spectral line can be observe this can be checked by simply observe the spectral line through large angle of incidence and adjust appropriately in a more practical sense the stage be control by 3 screw a it be the most stable configuration a mathematically 3 point determine a plane so any more or less than this would be much less stable 15 when the camera and eye piece be move to the zero order the angular scale read 203 degree and 10 arc minute now the sodium lamp could be replace by the hydrogen lamp and data be record a range of 4 th to -4 th order be measure a a large spread of data would give the best possible set of data in addition to this a second opinion be always utilized a this would give a value of uncertainty value for 3 discrete wavelength emission be record and with these a graph of sinθ against order be plot from the gradient of this straight line plot a value for λ can be obtain the error bar on these graph come from the difference in the two measurement take of the same emission line an error of the gradient can also be show on python with this information and the understand of which wavelength be cause by which transmission the value obtain can be substitute into equation 5 with n1=2 to find the rydberg constant error bar be very small with only reading from the -2 nd 1 st and 2 nd order have an associate error this mean that both measurement from two different people be the same for most record result with this transition the uncertainty of the slope be slightly high than expect due to a minor spread in result at the -1 st and 3 rd order the straight line be expect to pa through the origin and the fact that the error do not cover the actual intercept record must mean an unknown source of error the uncertainty in the slope be considerably small than transition 3 to 2 and simply from observation all the point lie very close to the line once again the line almost pas through the origin and lie outside of the calculate error error bar on this graph be large for order -3 -1 and 2. uncertainty for the slope be even high than for the transition from 3 to 2. the most obvious thing about this plot be the fact that only +/-2 order be measure this be because the intensity of these order be too low to be measure use the human eye also notice that the error bar increase in size a the order increase this could be due to the change in intensity make any kind of measurement subjective if more than one person be use to record the angle once again the line of best fit almost pas through the origin this could be down to systematic error for which there be plenty in this experiment with this information the rydberg constant can be calculate for all 3 transition v. analysis and error from the data 2 of the 3 calculate value give a value for the rydberg constant that lay within the associate error those be the one obtain from the red and blue transition the value associate with the cyan transition have such a small calculate error that it do not pa through the actual value for the rydberg constant a the line be so uniform and without blemish the error must be systematic now if a mean of all 3 value be take you find it give a value of 1.11x10 7 if the actual value of the rydberg constant be give to be 1.097x10 7 then the associate percentage error be 1.19 the standard deviation between all 3 value be 1.34x10 5 which give a standard error of +/-77365 this once again lie outside of the range of the actual value if transition 4 to 2 be take away and just the other two be consider we get a mean of 1.097x10 7 of course more than two piece of information be need to be able to establish a constant of some sort however this be still encourage it be clear to see that systematic error come into play when the cyan spectrum band be measure one possibility be that since background light be all around during the procedure it be entirely possible that background spectral line be measure and record instead of the one from the hydrogen emission spectrum lightbulb produce a continuous spectrum a continuous spectrum be one which all wavelength be present and there be no gap 16 alternatively the error could 've come from a misalignment of the spectrometer for all three of these discrete transition wavelength the set up be realign and return to the central maximum at the normal to the grate it be entirely possible that during the reset of the spectrometer the diffraction grate may have move within the slide or the grate stage may have move to some degree the fact that this transition be measure last may suggest why this be the only graph affected by such systematic error general source of error be hugely dependent on the quality of the set up for instance the dimension of the slit when measure the emission line work two way one way be to keep the slit a narrow a possible and get result with optimum precision but fail to measure the high order which lack intensity or keep the slit slightly wider which would reduce the precision however a well spread of result would be obtain in the case of this set up the slit be left a little bit wider so that for at least two of the line 4 order could be measure it be impossible to say what uncertainty this compromise have however it be most likely very small and can be ignore another possible source could be from the measurement of angle whilst calibrate the instrument each time an angle be measure it have an uncertainty of +/-0.0083 degree now throughout the set up the angle be measure 3 time not include the actual measurement if add in quadrature this lead to an error of +/-0.014 degree this may sound small but it be the equivalent of almost a whole arc minute in addition the measurement of an angle have 2 angle uncertainty so in total that give an angle uncertainty of +/-0.019 degree this be a very small uncertainty equivalent to just over 1 arc minute this assumes that every measurement be take to the near arc minute whereas on occasion a second opinion can give a completely different measurement over all of the measurement take it be found that the average uncertainty a a result of disagreement be 0.28 of an arc minute this be a surprisingly low uncertainty for angle measurement if we take this alone other uncertainty be difficult to calculate a they be either assumption or they be too difficult to compute without specialist equipment in conclusion despite the fact that the value obtain lie outside of the predict uncertainty this set up and experiment should be deem a a successful one due to the fact that a good value be obtain and a very slight unaccountable systematic error be so frequent for this kind of set up the error calculate must be below the true error of the experiment the fact that a percentage error of only 1.19 be obtain show the success and the validity of the experiment even though a slightly low percentage difference be expect due to the sophistication of the instrument it can still be say that the rydberg constant be calculate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and this be especially the case for transition 3 to 2 and 5 to 2 a the rydberg constant lie within their error range a. transition,extended,bal,,,
15,GS_QFQ712_Redacted,"this experiment be carry out to measure the spectrum of hydrogen and use the data to deduce the rydberg constant a well a investigate the resolution of a grate spectrometer the experimental method use be measure the angel between maximum of different order to calculate wavelength of spectral line for different colour and hence calculate the rydberg constant the experimental value be r∞ 10819294.13±82184.5m −1 which have an 1.4 uncertainty compare to the accepted value t he study of spectroscopy date back to 1600s when isaac newton discover the spectrum of visible light by focus a light beam through glass slit and observe rainbow a spectrometer be an instrument use in spectrometric analysis which be make up of specialise piece of equipment the setup of the spectrometer be show in fig 1. in the case of light source the spectrum have three form hot object such a filament emits continuous spectrum where the intensity be a slowly vary function of wavelength an emission spectrum occurs when atom or molecule be excite in hot gas emit extra light with certain wavelength cause well-defined bright line to appear in the spectrum an absorption spectrum appear a dark line in continuous spectrum and be cause by continuous spectrum go through cool gas and the atom or molecule absorb certain value of wavelength the latter two kind of spectrum can give information of temperature or density of the gas 1 in this experiment the balmer series which be the visible part in hydrogen emission spectrum be observe 2 spectroscopy be one of the most power tool for the study of plasma star structure of chemical for example in astronomy we can use the unique spectrum to identify the chemical makeup of object in space or measure the temperature and velocity of space object the rydberg constant be introduce in bohr 's model which explains the atomic spectrum of hydrogen a well a various other atom and ion 3 it be not perfectly accurate but historically played an important role in the development of quantum mechanic and it be a good approximation for hydrogen atom the diffraction grate u the principle of interference to separate spectrum into different color the grate can be consider a a large number of n narrow slit of equal space with separation d. for light of wavelength λ a principal maximum occurs when the neighbor ray have constructive interference which mean the phase difference between them be an integer multiple m of 2π the path difference be dsin θ a see in fig 2 therefore which show where m be the order number on the interference pattern and θ be the angel between specific order and zero order by plot a graph of m against sin θ for a know d a graph of straight line passing through the origin would be produce and we can therefore obtain the value of wavelength from the gradient the resolve power r of a grate be a measure of it ability to separate adjacent spectral line of average wavelength λ 4 it be usually express a the dimensionless quantity a show in fig 3 with n slit the first minimum occurs at a phase angle which be the phase difference add the angel base on number of slit the resolve power can be found use the criterion that the maximum of one diffraction pattern be at the same position a the minimum of another pattern a show in fig 4 fig 4. diffraction pattern of λ1 λ2 and the resolution.the λ here be the minimum distance which can be distinguish by eye and would act a a source of uncertainty 2 the relationship between two wavelength be λ 2 λ − λ which accord to equation 2 give a phase difference 2π λ2 × d sin θ. this will give a minimum value if combine equation 3 and 7 we find base on definition λ 2 λ− λ where λ λ the equation can be rearrange where the left hand side of the equation give the resolve power of spectrometer at this separation the two line can be easily see to be separate since the intensity at a point half way between two equal line be 20 less than the peak 2 to find the value of the rydberg constant the formula of transition wavelength in hydrogen be use where n and n be integer which represent the high energy level and low energy level respectively 3 .in balmer series in hydrogen n'=2 and n=3,4,5 correspond to red blue and violet line of the visible spectrum.fig 5 show the transition of electron in a hydrogen atom λ be the transition wavelength which can be obtain from equation 3 .r ∞ be the rydberg constant which have an accepted value of 10973731.56851m −1 6 fig 5. representation of the transition in a hydrofen atom where balmer trainsitions be at n'=2 7 a more fundamental form explain in the bohr model can be express a where m e be the mass of the electron c be the speed of light h be the plank 's constant and 0 be electrical field permittivity of free space the spectrometer be set up a below procedure to make sure the instrument be properly align and focused.we firstly focus the eyepiece on the cross-hair `` x `` with both eye open and then focus the camera lens so that an object which be approximately 10 meter away be focus on the cross line the telescope eyepiece and camera lens be make align with the collimator and than the focus of the collimator be adjust with the sodium lamp illuminate until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire we then do the follow to make sure the light be at normal incidence so the measure angle be not affected by misalignment.the telescope be rotate precisely 90 degree with the aid of the scale a mirror be put on on the holder and grate table be turn until we just saw a reflect image at the cross-line in the eyepiece which mean the grate be at 45 degree to the incident beam.the grate be then rotate 45 degree precisely use the scale and light be at normal incidence the spectrometer can obtain precise measurement if set up properly with a precision about ± 0.2nm for yellow orange light 2 also the reading would be a precise a 1 60 degree for the measurement of spectrometer resolution the 7 th order of the sodium source be observe we reduce the effective number of grate line by gradually slide two piece of parallel card which be put in front of the grate until we could just resolve the two line of the yellow doublet.the width of space between two card be measure use vernier caliper which have an uncertainty ±0.1mm from the center and multiple measurement be take to calculate the mean and standard deviation the measurement be take by two person individually and the average be calculate to minimize random error while take readings.six set of measurement be take in total for red blue and violet line in the hydrogen spectrum and measurement for each color be repeat once.the result be then analyze in python accord to equation 3 where the gradient of the graph be equal to d λ the associate graph be show in fig 6. fig 6. graph of order against sin θ for different color.linear relation between the order and sin θ be show which be correct accord to equation 3 the gradient of each graph be then calculate use python.the result of the wavelength and it uncertainty be show in table .1. the accepted value for balmer series for n= 3,4,5 which corresponds to red blue and violet in this experiment and their wavelength be 656.3nm,486.1nm and 434.0nm respectively 8 .this give the experimental value for wavelength of uncertainty 1.31 1.54 1.25 1.87 1.06 and 14.6 which be quite accurate except the second measurement of violet line nevertheless a show in fig 6 the graph for the second measurement of violet fail to match a straight line this indicates systematic error in the measurement take therefore this set of data would not be use to obtain the rydberg constant the uncertainty of 1 λ be give by where k be the gradient of the graph and d be the grate space which be equal to 3.3840947546531303×10 −6 m for 300 line per mm grate and 1.269035532994924×10 −5 m for 80 line per mm grate and the uncertainty of the experimental value of rydberg constant be simply give by which be why the uncertainty of 1 λ be calculate instead of λ previously then the value of the rydberg constant calculate from each measurement with it uncertainty be show in table .2 where equation 10 be use the mean value of the rydberg constant be calculate and the error be add in quadrature give a final value r ∞ 10819294.13 ± 82184.5m −1 for the spectrometer resolution seven set of measurement be take and provide a mean value for card width 2.34±0.02 mm the number of sufficient slit n be then calculate by where 80 lines/mm grate be use and give n=187.2±1.6 accord to equation 9 the resolution of λ 0.4489 ± 0.05 nm the data be interpret in way such that the random error can be minimize firstly the zero order of each wavelength in the spectrum be obtain by calculate the mean of m ±1 to reduce the uncertainty at this order.the importance of this approach be that the diffract line should be symmetrical about the normal and the angel should be same for ±n th order.secondly the second measurement of violet line be not use because the graph suggest the data obtain be wrong.this could due to the intensity of violet light be dimmer than other color which make it more difficult to measure precisely.nevertheless there be four visible hydrogen emission spectrum in balmer series 9 so the forth color might interrupt the reading and hence the result might be record in the wrong order number there be several possibility for systematic error in this experiment for example the light noise from lamp and computer and eye parallax while take the reading.also misalignment and defocus of the instrument might contribute to the error when set up the apparatus or when they be accidentally move during the experiment.furthermore factor such a grate period air pressure or humidity can also have an effect on the measurement in conclusion the rydberg constant and the resolve power of a spectrometer have be deduce by observe hydrogen and sodium spectrum ussing the spectrometer.the first method use be to record the angle of different order for three different wavelength and deduce the rydberg constant from gradient of the graph plot from data.the second method be to measure the efficient grate number for the doublet to just resolve and hence find the resolution the obtain value of the rydberg constant give 1.4 uncertainty compare to the accepted value 10973731.56851m −1 which be quite satisfactory.the result of resolution of the spectrometer show the precision of a spectrometer and this provide sufficient confidence for the result obtain use this instrument the experiment have be do and data have be analyze to minimize error with sufficient approach such a repeat measurement find zero order by average angel at ±1 order and abandon wrong data.also the associate error be calculate in a delicate way.however the experiment can be improve by building up a large data base and observe four color instead of three which be feasible if apparatus be align and focus perfectly.also reduce the background light and fix the lamp position can also improve the

16,GS_JWI426_Redacted,in this report we detail how a spectrometer be use to determine the rydberg constant 𝑅 ∞ to a relatively high degree of precision use the spectral emission line from excite hydrogen gas we first calibrate the spectrometer to make accurate repeatable measurement before use it to measure the angle at which the maximum of diffract light from the emission spectrum of excite hydrogen occur maximum angle be then record for the observe red cyan and blue spectral line of the balmer series which yield wavelength of 656.12 ± 0.33 nm 485.90 ± 0.41 nm and 433.78 ± 0.38 nm respectively use elementary diffraction grate theory and the rydberg formula base on the bohr model of the atom we then calculate a value for the rydberg constant for each wavelength before use these value to arrive at a final value for 𝑅 ∞ of 1.0975 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 we then finally move on to examine the extent of random error in our result and discus potential cause of systematic error which may have contribute to our obtain value deviation from the accepted value for 𝑅 ∞ of 10973731.6 m -1 1 from a young age we be familiarise with the notion of atom be comprise of negatively charge electron orbit a heavy positively charge nucleus after much development in atomic theory over the last century we now know that atom have a much richer structure involve the idea that electron have quantise energy state and be described probabilistically by their wavefunction one of the key development in atomic theory come in 1913 when the idea that light be emit a discrete quantum of energy a propose by einstein and planck be use by neils bohr to formulate the semi-quantum bohr model of the atom which provide a justification to the then empirically derive rydberg formula the formula itself provide a relation between energy level transition make by electron and the wavelength of photon they emit a we will soon see this equation involves a constant know a the rydberg constant which be what we aim to measure use a diffraction grate spectrometer although more modern and sophisticated photo spectrometric method exist 2 to measure wavelength to an even great degree of accuracy 3 the method present here still provide a relatively accurate value for the rydberg constant despite it make use of a relatively simple experimental setup the spectrometer be in principle a simple piece of apparatus which first collimates a source of light into a single beam which be then normal and incident on a diffraction grate comprise of slit of separation d. from elementary diffraction theory we can recall that whenever the phase difference φ between two ray coincident at a point be an integer multiple m of 2𝜋 the ray will constructively interfere to produce a maximum from figure 1 we can easily see by geometry that the path difference between adjacent ray be equal to 𝑑 sin 𝜃 where 𝜃 be the angle between the ray incident to the m th order maximum and the grate normal since path difference be equal to 𝜆𝜑/2𝜋 we can equate to yield 𝑑 sin 𝜃 𝑚 𝜆 1 from this we can see that a plot of sin 𝜃 against order number will produce a graph whose linear fit will have a gradient 𝜆/𝑑 thus since d be know we can calculate the wavelength of the light pas into the spectrometer which in our case be from the de-excitation of hydrogen atom when the electron de-excite they do so by 'falling from an energy level n down to a level of low energy p and in do so they emit a photon of energy equal to the energy difference traverse by the electron to explain the relation between n p and the wavelength of emit light bohr postulate that the angular momentum l of electron be quantise with relation to planck 's constant 4 such that where ħ be the reduce planck constant bohr then also assume that the electron follow classical circular orbit thus allow for the relation of l to the electron velocity v via 𝐿 𝑚 𝑒 𝑣𝑟 where r be the orbital radius and 𝑚 𝑒 the mass of the electron from this we find that if we now attribute the centripetal force f maintain the orbit to the electrostatic coulomb attraction between the electron and the nucleus which both posse a charge of e for hydrogen we can write where 𝜀 0 be the permittivity of free space this can be rearrange and combine with equation 3 to show that the electron exist at discrete radius 𝑟 𝑛 from the nucleus such that by invoke the non-relativistic equation for kinetic energy and again invoke equation 3 it can be show that the energy 𝐸 𝑛 of an electron in the nth energy level be give by where 𝐸 1 be the ground state the low energy state an electron may occupy now since an emit photon 's energy be equal to the energy decrease an electron experience during de-excitation note energy level have negative value we can write where 𝐸 𝑝 be the magnitude of the energy level the electron de-excites to and 𝜆 be the wavelength of the emit photon if we combine this with equation 6 we arrive the once empirically obtain rydberg equation where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant which may be express a this be the quantity which we will set out to measure by use the spectrometer to determine the wavelength of emit photon if we then finally combine equation 8 with equation 1 we can relate 𝑅 ∞ to the angle 𝜃 of maximum order m to give where g be the gradient of the linear fit for a graph of sin 𝜃 against m thus if n and p be know we can measure 𝑅 ∞ fig 2. an energy diagram show some of the energy level an electron may occupy within a hydrogen atom the arrow show correspond to transition an electron may make during deexcitation the arrow be show in group correspond to the energy level they transit to which be know a the series of the transition show here left to right be the paschen balmer and lyman series 5 dash arrow indicate the infinite amount of possible transition due to electron transition from the infinite number of high energy level whose limit be the ionisation energy of hydrogen figure 2 show some of the theoretically infinite possible transition an electron may make during de-excitation in our experiment we will be observe only the balmer series which be the collection of transition where the electron de-excites to the second energy level correspond to p 2 a we be restrict to only be able to measure visible wavelength in our experiment we will measure the first three wavelength correspond to n 3 4 and 6 also refer to a ba-α ba-β and ba-γ transition the first part of the experiment consist largely of set up the spectrometer correctly to enable it to make accurate and repeatable measurement to begin the eye piece be focus onto the crosshair which be position such that the line be diagonal and would not be parallel to spectral line the camera lens be then focus to an object at an arbitrarily long distance ≈ 10m to ensure that the source can be accurately resolve the room be darken to minimise background light before a test sodium lamp be then turn on and place in front of the slit a mirror be secure into the same central position a where the grate will reside the telescope be then align with the collimator and the slit be set at a small width to aid in determine peak focus before it be place in front of the collimator the collimator focus be the adjust until maximum focus of the slit be achieve the crosshair be then align to the centre of the slit and the correspond angular position be record a 169°00 the telescope be then rotate through 90° result in a position of 79°00 ± 1 the telescope be temporarily secure and grate table hold the mirror be rotate until the sodium emergent from the narrow slit be incident on the crosshair see through the telescope at this point the rotational position of the table be record again a 79°00 ± 1 to ensure it have not move before it be then rotate by 45° such that the grate table and by extension the mirror be normal to the ray incident to the mirror after be unsecured the telescope be then move back round to it approximate initial position the mirror be then replace by a 300 div/mm diffraction grate orient such that the grate be approximately vertical we then view the spectral pattern of the diffract sodium light through the telescope the fine adjustment screw on the central grate table be then alter until all the visible spectral line on both side of the central maximum be a vertical a possible with respect to the crosshair and by extension the plane of rotation to minimise the skew of the pattern to enable a many maximum to be see a possible with this the setup process conclude and we then move on to make measurement the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen lamp before we proceed to record the angular position of the maximum for the observe red cyan and blue spectral line use the vernier scale on the spectrometer for each colour the first and second order maximum position be record a total of three time result in a total of 45 measurement be make include the measurement of the position of the central maximum the 3 rd order maximum be very faint compare to the other maximum and their position be hard to determine thus they be not measure a they would introduce a significant amount of random error through the spectrometer telescope we be able to resolve red cyan and blue spectral line which by reference to figure 2 we can attribute to the n 3 n 4 and n 5 initial energy level in the balmer series respectively a expect note that the wavelength we have call blue may be interpret a violet or purple by some for all measurement a diffraction grate of slit separation 3.33 ± 0.03 µm be use all the angle for each set of measurement be normalise with respect to the position of the central maximum to mitigate the introduction of systematic error from the telescope be misalign in between set of measurement be make the main source of statistical uncertainty arises from the fact that it be difficult to determine the exact location of the maximum of a spectral line due to the subjective nature of the human eye the degree of this effect be positively correlate with the observe width which be obtain by measure the thickness of the maximum correspond to m 1 for each colour which for all wavelength be see to be roughly 25 although the width of the bright region in which one could realistically determine to be the maximum have a small width of around 10 the width of this be then halve to obtain the effective error of 5 this effect be exacerbate by the vernier scale be inherently difficult to read exactly by eye especially give the dim light result in a

contribute to the overall systematic uncertainty in our measurement the most likely and obvious of which be the improper setup of the spectrometer in particular the misalignment of the diffraction grate cause it to be nonnormal to the ray incident on it another possible source of systematic error can be attribute to the variation in wavelength result from the refractive index of air not be exactly equal to that of air in a vacuum to investigate this idea we can consider the wave equation and recall the definition of a refractive index n of a material a the ratio of c to the wave speed in the medium from this we can then relate a wavelength 𝜆 of light in a medium to it wavelength in a vacuum 𝜆 0 a 𝜆 0 𝑛𝜆 10 if we now take n to be the accepted value of the refractive index of air at standard temperature and pressure a 𝑛 1.000277 6 from these value we obtain the value show in table ii and a final value for the rydberg constant of 𝑅 ∞ 1.0975 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 which have a small deviation from the accepted value of just 0.012 the wavelength for blue be now also in agreement with the accepted value show in table ii note that the assumption that the air use be under standard condition be valid a it can be show apply elden 's formula 7 to possible deviation from standard condition yield negligible difference in refractive index the uncertainty associate with the value of n itself be consider negligible a it experimental uncertainty be of the order ± 10 -8 our experiment set out to measure the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy use only a spectrometer and the bohr model of the atom our final obtain value for 𝑅 ∞ of 1.0975 ± 0.0008 × 10 7 m -1 agrees with the accepted value with a percentage difference of just 0.012 although our method obtain a relatively accurate result there be several way in which it could be modify to far increase the accuracy for example the great source of random error arose from the difficulty in accurately reading the vernier scale which could easily be solve via the digitisation of the vernier scale this would carry the add advantage of make the measurement process less laborious meaning that more measurement could be make in our limited allocate time which would far reduce the statistical error the other major source of random error which arose due to the difficulty in determine the position of the central point of maximum could be resolve use a photodiode which would allow u to quantitatively determine the point at which peak intensity and by extension the maximum occur the use of a photodiode would also have the add benefit of lift our restriction on be able to measure only visible wavelength meaning that we would be able to obtain measurement from the other transition series of hydrogen depict in figure 2 thus allow for a large data set and a form of verification that bohr 's model do indeed hold for all energy transition a point worth note be that the red maximum be notably brighter and more prominent than the other colour which may be attribute to the fact that at low voltage the baα transition be more probable to occur 8 result in red have a great intensity to resolve this one could simply increase the voltage a the other two transition probability increase with voltage up to a limit another possible reason for red have a great intensity be that in the visible spectrum low wavelength light be emit at a great intensity by hot body such a the incandescent lamp use in the laboratory a described by planck 's radiation law 9 although this effect could be rule out by simply carry out the experiment in a strictly zero-background light environment although a consideration of light wavelength dependence on refractive index result in our calculate value agree with the accepted value to a marginally great extent the fact that all value for 𝑅 ∞ be great than the accepted value suggests some form of systematic error be likely from the general mis-alignment of the equipment which can only be remedied by take great care during the setup procedure or by use more sophisticated equipment the standard rule of error propagation be apply to equation 10 to give an expression for the uncertainty 𝜎 𝑅 ∞ in the rydberg constant a where 𝜎 𝑑 be the absolute uncertainty in slit separation 𝜎 𝐺 be the absolute uncertainty in the gradient and k be a constant define a 1/4

17,GS_ZZF399_Redacted,in this experiment the diffraction pattern of a collimate beam of light from a hydrogen lamp incident on a grate be observe calculate two of the balmer transition wavelength and use these to calculate the rydberg constant from the diffraction pattern of the red transition wavelength the rydberg constant r ∞ be calculate to be 10920433.3 +/-9208.4 m -1 whereas use the turquoise transition wavelength r ∞ be calculate equally successfully to be 11011588.6 +/-14990.0 m -1 give error of 0.49 and 0.34 respectively in comparison to the true value of 10973731.6 m -1 when electromagnetic radiation be pas through a spectrometer the beam be collimate by a lens and then disperse by a grate this allows the diffraction pattern to be focus observe and use the vernier scale the position of the maximum can be measure for a beam of wavelength λ and separation d of slit in the grate the maximum of order m will be at the angle θ described by 1 𝜃 𝑠𝑖𝑛 −1 𝑚 𝜆 𝑑 from which the wavelength can be calculate use this and knowledge of the transition wavelength of the source of radiation in this case hydrogen in a hydrogen lamp the rydberg constant can then be calculate in this experiment we aim to observe the diffraction pattern of the different transition wavelength of the balmer series characteristic to the define energy shift within the hydrogen atom in excitation use knowledge of these shift we also aim to accurately measure the rydberg constant when an electric current be pas through a tube contain hydrogen gas it cause the excitation and subsequent deexcitation of the electron cause the emission of photon of characteristic wavelength to the distinct energy gap between energy level due to the energy of the electron be quantise four of these transition wavelength exist in the spectrum of visible light so can be observe by the human eye in a spectrometer the beam from the hydrogen lamp be collimate by a lens before fall incident on a diffraction grate at the grate multiple path be take by the beam to the point where the intensity be be observe each have slightly differ path length cause the path to be at different point in their phase progression cause the path to interfere the difference in path length be give by 2 difference in path length 𝑑 sin 𝜃 found from the assumption that the path to the point of measurement be virtually parallel and so can be view like in the follow figure carefully put in place and the position of the 0 th order maximum where θ 0° be found to be ≈ 66° use the vernier 's scale allow it to be identify in the result initially the diffraction pattern of the red light be examine the telescope be rotate to the great degree where the maximum be still discernible and the location of this maximum be record the position of the successive maximum be then record until the maximum become indiscernible cover the whole spectrum that would still give precise measurement the measurement be then repeat by a second observer to give data for comparison to check for erroneous result the same process be then repeat for the diffraction pattern result from the turquoise light the blue and the violet diffraction pattern be observe to check for similar trend however not measure due to have too few discernible maximum to give a trend that would provide accurate result the sine of the location of the maximum be then plot against the order in the relationship give by equation 4 which be thus plot use the gradient of which easily give the wavelength of the light use the balmer series the 2 calculate wavelength be equate with the correspond wavelength produce from change in energy level of the electron in hydrogen described by their transition from initial state n n 3 for the red light n 4 for turquoise to final state p p 2 in the balmer series allow the rydberg constant to be calculate use equation 5 for the 2 different diffraction pattern due to the calculation for the rydberg constant only require a string of multiplication the error analysis only require the use of two equation for their propagation 6 𝜎 𝑓 f√ equation 6 be apply in the case of calculate error in slit space d from error in the number of slit per unit distance s a d s -1 and error in the calculate rydberg constant from error in the wavelength 7 be apply in the case of calculate error in wavelength from the error in gradient m from the calculate covariance matrix and slit space d. for both diffraction pattern analyse the 2 set of data 1 from each observer be treat independently and compare to check for any erroneous result once compare and trend checked the 2 value for rydberg 's constant be calculate and a mean average be take due to error in θ be so small in comparison to the measure value the error bar have not be include in the graph for clarity the value for r ∞ determine experimentally be compare against the accepted value 12 r ∞ 10973731.6 m -1 and so can be see that the calculate value both come very close to the true value have error of 0.49 and 0.34 for the red and turquoise diffraction pattern respectively the result also come with very small uncertainty 0.08 and 0.14 respectively with the experiment have very high precision with very little random error however neither allows for the accepted value to fall within their range include uncertainty this suggests there be some small systematic error in the experiment or a random error exists from a source that have n't be identify these systematic error may possibly exist in manufacturing error in the slit error in focus or misalignment of the spectrometer or even in change condition in the laboratory additional random error that could account for the accepted value fall out of the range of uncertainty be in the maximum not be perfectly distinct a the initial slit be imperfect due to obstruction on it edge the edge of maximum be not a sharp a would be ideal for the experiment the orientation of maximum be also not perfectly vertical despite somewhat be counteract by align the crosshair with the midpoint of the maximum this may be another source of uncertainty additionally maximum at large angle be not perfectly focus add uncertainty and possibly identify a systematic error in focus and their intensity drop significantly both reduce the precision in measurement for the location of the maximum these error would have be partially cover in the error found in the gradient from the covariance matrix of the line of best fit however their magnitude may be underrepresented in the final uncertainty an indication of a source of possible source of systematic error could be see when observe the maximum upon examination there be maximum that could not be identify use the balmer series at regular interval hint at an error in set-up or with the grate or other equipment however if the average between the two calculate value for the rydberg constant be take it give 13 average calculate value for r ∞ 10966011.0 +/-8796.2 m -1 which have only 0.07 error and also include the accepted value for the rydberg constant within it range of uncertainty while maintain a very high precision overall this experiment be highly successful achieve the aim set out of calculate the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy with the final calculate value only have an error of 0.07 with the accepted value also fall within the range of uncertainty however the value calculate directly from each diffraction pattern be not quite a accurate and the accepted value lay outside both range of uncertainty suggest there be a small systematic error or an unaccounted/not fully account source of random error the most likely cause for this be a systematic error in the setup or manufacturing error of the equipment or slit see in the existence of unidentifiable maximum when the diffraction pattern be observe which may have alter the pattern and give rise to the small amount of error additionally there be some source of random error that have uncertainty that may have be underrepresented by the uncertainty in the gradient stem from the uncertainty in location of the maximum however for these random error to increase the uncertainty to the point where it include the accepted value it would require the final standard error in their result to increase by a factor of 5 and 2 respectively which be heavily unlikely due to the small magnitude of the uncertainty in location therefore be unlikely to be a significant factor in the inaccuracy of the calculate value ultimately both calculate result and the final average value have a very high level of accuracy and so any small factor or change in condition may have cause these error due to their magnitude a can be see in it high accuracy the experiment have many strength include the high precision measurement the experiment allow to be take and the ease of the experiment allow a large amount of data to be take however despite it large amount of success the experiment can still be improve upon in particular reduce the background light would allow for the width of the initial slit and the maximum to be reduce due to an increase in visibility of the maximum increase precision in the measurement this change would also allow for maximum of blue and violet colour to be more visible and so also accurately measure give more possible data to support or dispute the calculate value increase accuracy and confidence in the final result,superficial,bal,,,
18,GS_IHJ555_Redacted,where 𝜆 be the wavelength r ∞ be the rydberg constant with a measure value of 10973731.6 m -1 n and p be integer represent the energy level n be the initial state and p be the final state 2 by use equation 1 and the theoretical value of the rydberg constant we can calculate the wavelength and predict the colour of the light that we expect to see the light with the long wavelength be emit when electron drop from initial state 3 to final state 2. the wavelength be calculate to be 656 nm use equation 1 and this wavelength fall into the wavelength range for red light therefore the light with the long wavelength we expect to see be red light the grate have a large number of very narrow slit which be equally space the grate equation can be use to determine the wavelength of light where dsinθ be the path difference a show in fig 6 and m be the order number rearrange this equation we get therefore if we plot sinθ vs. m the gradient of the line of best fit of the graph will be the value of since we know the value of d we can calculate the wavelength of the light after determine the wavelength we have all the data we need to calculate the experimental value of rydberg constant use equation 1 fig 6. the path difference between light that go through the grate in this experiment we use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta and the wavelength of the light emit by a hydrogen lamp then calculate the rydberg constant in order to set up the spectrometer we focus the eyepiece and camera and align them with the axis of the collimator we set the cross wire a an `` x `` since it be easy to use this way then we turn the telescope which be the eyepiece and the camera lens through 90 degree and adjust the grate table until a reflect image be see in the eyepiece this mean that the incident beam from the collimator be now at 45 degree to the grate surface a show in fig 7. then we rotate the grate through precisely 45 degree accord to the scale so that it be set at 0 degree to the incident light beam 2 in order to make sure that the spectrum be not inclined we cover the upper and low part of the light source use two piece of tape a show in fig 8 thus the light be shorten and be fit into the cross wire completely a show in fig 9. by do this when we rotate the eyepiece we be allow to check if the spectrum be inclined left spectrum observe without use tape to shorten them when rotate the telescope can not check if the spectrum be inclined right spectrum observe after use tape to shorten them can check if the emission spectrum be inclined when rotate the telescope we rotate the telescope left and right horizontally until we observe a light and note the value of theta at that position in order to get a value for the uncertainty in theta me and my lab partner both read the value and we estimate that there be an error of ± 1.45 × 10 -4 radian associate with our measurement since both of u read a value of theta for each order we have two value of theta associate with the light since the space between the central maximum and the emit light with the same colour of an order that have the same magnitude should be equal e.g the red emit light of order ± 1 have the same distance from the central maximum the angle theta of the positive and negative order should have the same magnitude therefore we plot the sine of the average value of theta against the magnitude of the order accord to equation 3 the gradient of the line of best fit corresponds to the value of therefore by multiply the gradient by d we determine the wavelength by use equation 1 we can obtain the value of rydberg constant iv error result discussion by use equation 1 and the theoretical value of the rydberg constant we predict that the long wavelength of the light that we could observe be 656 nm this light be create when electron drop from energy level three to energy level two use the standard colour spectrum chart we found that the light with the long wavelength that we could expect to see be the red light refer to equation 1 we need the value of wavelength to determine the rydberg constant accord to equation 3 the graph sinθ vs. m should be a straight line and the gradient of the line of best fit corresponds to the value of by plot the data from table i. we obtain graph 1.0 and graph 2.0. in this experiment the grate we use have 78.8 line per mm therefore the space d be 0.0127 mm the gradient of the line of best fit for the green light be 0.04208 rad/m multiply this value by 0.0127 × 10 -3 m we determine that the wavelength of green light be 535 ± 185 nm similarly we determine the wavelength of red light be 678 ± 185 nm since the wavelength be a function of and a constant d we calculate the error associate with the wavelength by do differentiation formula use be show in appendix rearrange equation 1 for the rydberg constant therefore the rydberg constant be a function of 𝜆 n and p. since n and p be the energy level there be no error associate with them and 2 can be treat a a constant therefore only 𝜆 contributes to the error associate with 𝑅 we determine the error associate with it by do differentiation with respect to 𝜆 formula use be show in appendix we calculate the error associate with the rydberg constant to be ± 28993.5 m -1 for the red emit light and ± 35283.0 m -1 for the green emit light theta θ rad order table i. the value of theta associate with the 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd order red light and green light since there be energy release when electron drop from a high energy state to a low one and energy can be calculate by use where e be the energy h be planck 's constant and f be the frequency also where c be the speed of light 𝜆 be the wavelength combine equation 5 and 6 we get therefore energy be inversely proportional to the wavelength the light with the long wavelength be emit when the least amount of energy be release thus for the red light it initial state be 3 final state be 2. therefore n be equal to 3 and p be equal to 2. by use equation 1 and the wavelength we determine we calculate that the rydberg constant be 10622602.54 ± 28993.5 m -1 for the green light it initial state be 4 final state be 2. therefore we calculate the rydberg constant to be 9978172.747 ± 35283.0 m -1 compare these value with the theoretical value of the rydberg constant 10973731.6 m -1 there be 3.1 difference between the two value for the red emit light and 9.0 between the two value for the green emit light calculation be show in appendix the rydberg constant calculate use the data for the red light be more accurate than the one calculate use data of the green light one of the reason be that during the experiment we notice that the red light be observe to be more focus than the green light therefore we be more likely to get accurate measurement of theta for the red light graph 1.0 sinθ vs. m for the green light graph 2.0 sinθ vs. m for the red light the error associate with the reading of theta be random error it be cause by our judgement to determine this error we read off the theta from the scale alternatively and estimate that the uncertainty associate with the theta we measure be ± 1.45×10 -4 radian there be other source of error that affected our data for example when we observe the light the light be a bit blurry so defocus exist this mean that when we read off the angle the value be not precise also there be background light give that we be not work in a complete dark environment this could have impact on our data because the background light affected our judgement to place the emit light on the same place for each measurement and make it hard for u to observe the light clearly therefore we could not get measurement of theta also since we align the spectrometer manually the equipment could be not in the completely align position a a result of misalignment the value of angle theta we measure could be not accurate v. conclusion by do this experiment we determine the rydberg constant r ∞ which have a measure value of 10973731.6 m -1 to 9978172.747 ± m -1 for the green emit light and 10622602.54 ± m -1 for the red emit light the method use in this experiment be to use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta associate with the emit light for an order m then calculate the wavelength 𝜆 associate with the light via equation 2 together with these data we use equation 1 to calculate the rydberg constant the percent difference between the theoretical value of rydberg constant and the experimental value we obtain be 9.0 for the green emit light and 3.1 for the red emit light calculation be show in appendix this experiment show that one way to determine the rydberg constant be to use a spectrometer during the experiment we measure the data we need without major problem and the final result be relatively close to the theoretical value of r ∞ however we spent a large amount of time do the set-up therefore we fail to complete all the calculation within the time give from this experiment we learnt a way to determine the rydberg constant also we reinforce our knowledge on identify source of error such a defocus misalignment we also have a deeper understand of the importance of preliminary data by take preliminary data we gain some knowledge about the process thus we can take the definitive data more efficiently and accurately appendix formula use in calculate percent difference,expert,the,,,

conduct experiment be to accurately determine the rydberg constant with the use of a grate spectrometer specifically this meant passing the light of a hydrogen lamp through the slit in one end of the spectrometer and use the telescope at the other to determine different angle at which different maximum on a diffraction pattern occur this enable the use of equation to calculate the wavelength of the emission spectrum and then the rydberg constant from the bohr model atom have definitive energy level where electron exist 2 in a gas when an electron receives sufficient energy it becomes excite and jump to a high energy level during the experiment a voltage be put across a hydrogen lamp thus excite electron of hydrogen atom once electron have jumped to a high energy level they deexcite back down energy level release a photon or photon if they do this in multiple stage these photon frequency can be calculate use the equation where e be the energy of a photon in joule h be plank constant in joule second and f be the frequency in hertz the energy of these photon be equal to the difference in potential energy of the energy level the electron move between some of the frequency and thus the wavelength f the photon from hydrogen be in the visible spectrum between 390nm and 700nm 3 and this mean that they can be observe use the human eye in hydrogen these transition be from the balmer series and specifically be call 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 show red aqua and blue colour respectively if we then calculate the wavelength of these emission we can use the transition formula for hydrogen to calculate the rydberg constant where 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant in 𝑚 −1 𝜆 be the wavelength of the photon in meter and n and p be integer which represent the energy level of the initial and final

constant which be unitless b. spectrometer theory when incident light pas into a diffraction grate the light will split and superimpose produce an interference pattern this superposition will be constructive if two beam of light have a phase difference of an integer n of 2𝜋n at these point maximum will be observe and the angle from the incident beam can be measure use the telescope from figure 2 we can use trigonometry to get the equation for this first order maximum where d be the slit separation in meter and 𝜃 be the angle of diffraction in radian this equation be for a path difference be one wavelength and so the other maximum occur when the path difference be an integer n wavelength apart this give the equation where n be the order of the maximum to obtain the most accurate value for the wavelength of 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 the spectrometer be align such that the grate be perpendicular to the incident light this ensures the central maximum of each 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 will be on top of each other to get a standard zero value it also mean that the interference pattern be in accordance with 6 a 6 would not be valid for light enter non-perpendicular to the slit this ensures the most accurate result possible the first procedure carry out to align the spectrometer be focus the eyepiece such that the cross be clear this be to stop strain on the eye over long period of time it be also ensure that the crosshairs show a `` cross `` shape oppose to a `` plus `` a a cross be easy to distinguish on a dark background secondly the objective lens be focus this be conduct by move the spectrometer to a window the objective lens be then adjust until the building opposite come into focus now the collimator need to be focus with the telescope this be carry out in a dark room and start by illuminate a sodium lamp at the end of the collimator the lamp be put a close a possible to the slit a the light intensity increase via the inverse square law a you move the lamp closer this ensures that the brightest pattern be obtain also applies with the hydrogen lamp a slit then become visible in the telescope when in line with the collimator and so the collimator be adjust until focus now the spectrometer be focus it next need to be align to do this first the telescope be move precisely 90 degree around from the point where the crosshairs be on the slit a mirror be then place into the grate table and the table be rotate until the slit be again visible in the telescope at this point the telescope be return 90 degree and the grate table be rotate 45 degree the reading on the spectrometer should now be note a this be the reference `` zero `` point instead of a mirror in the grate table the chosen grate be then insert and a 78.8 line per mm grate be found to be most suit in find the optimal number of spectral line next the grate table need to be parallel with the spectrometer to do this the pattern be observe in the telescope and the height of the table be adjust until all the line in the series be at the same height a well a this remember to the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen lamp the sodium lamp be use for set up a be it bright and the hydrogen lamp get too hot if left on for long period of time which be not ideal during calibration of the equipment when measure diffraction angle it be ensure to not leave the hydrogen lamp on too long to avoid it become too hot and spectral line too dim in our experiment there be three visible colour of line these be from 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 and be produce by emission of certain energy photon and be part of the balmer series these line be measure until they be no longer clearly visible either side of the central maximum this produce four line either side of the central maximum for each colour and the angle at which the line be present be measure the grate spectrometer use have a vernier scale and so care be make to use it correctly a the number on it be small and hard to read after a long period of use some of the line in the telescope become hard to resolve and to distinguish colour and so the hydrogen lamp would be turn off and wait to cool this be to ensure that no line be miss during observation reduce the chance of outlier in our result from figure 3 you can see that the wavelength of the aqua light be much closer to the blue to alpha a the linear fit be much closer together this be because a previously mention from 3 a you move far away from the nucleus of hydrogen the energy level energy get closer together by and inverse square law and so the p=4 and p=5 energy level energy be closer than the p=3 and p=4 this lead to possible confusion between the aqua and blue line a not only be they close together but be also of similar colour this be a possible source of random error in the experiment and so great effort be make to distinguish between line by not keep the hydrogen lamp on for too long once all angle have be record dsin𝜃 against n be plot for red aqua and blue from 6 the gradient of this plot be equal to the wavelength of the photon emit and the graph should show a linear relationship with these wavelength 2 be then use to calculate the rydberg constant 𝐻 𝛼 𝐻 𝛽 and 𝐻 𝛾 wavelength be thus found to equal 657.0 ± 1 n𝑚 −1 491.3 ± 1 n𝑚 −1 and 443.5 ± another possible source of error could be in the diffraction grate in that it could be dirty thus diffract the light slightly or the line in the grate could be slightly not parallel from it manufacture this be a problem a in the derivation of 6 it be assume that there be a constant slit separation to reduce the chance for these source of error the grate should be thoroughly clean before use a well a this different brand grate should be use this ensures that the slit be perfectly

determine an accurate value of the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer and visible emission spectrum in the balmer series through this experimental procedure the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10850000 ± 90000 𝑚 −1 which be 1.088 away from the accepted value of 10973731.568508 𝑚 −1 which have a relative uncertainty of 5.9×10 −12 the accepted value be outside the suppose uncertainty in the measure value this show there be still step that could be take to ensure a more accurate result to reduce the error in the experiment the whole method should be repeat use a completely different set of equipment thus ensure the data be reproducible furthermore it ensures that there be no systematic bias in the set of equipment that be originally be use it also reduces the chance of unavoidable human error cause anomalous result in the data finally proven in the appendix there be another fourth violet emission 𝐻 𝛿 in the balmer series which be in the visible spectrum it be from

the emission line from an electron drop from n=3,4,5 down to n=2 balmer series and these result be concordant give a value of r ∞ =10,562,000±326,000m -1 5sf when electron in an atom be excite they be promote to a high energy level and rapidly drop back down since the energy of each level be precisely define the energy change from each drop in energy level will also come in precise value due to conservation law this energy will be release in the form of a photon -but how will we know what the wavelength would be it can be show that for an energy level in a hydrogen atom n=n the energy of an electron in this level will be proportional to 1 𝑛 2 1 therefore if an electron be drop from energy level n=n to level n=p the energy of the photon would be proportional to 1 𝑛 2 − 1 𝑝 2 for the follow experiment we will let p=2 and so p 2 =4 2 we now have energy e constant × 1 by define the rydberg constant to be 𝑅 ∞ − 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 ℎ𝑐 we now have 2 observe the spectral line upon observe the different line we would see a variety of colour the most clearly visible be red blue and indigo on the spectrum therefore before begin to measure diffraction angle we calculate to which value of principal quantum number n each colour correspond it be found that the aforementioned colour correspond to n=3,4 and 5 respectively 5 we note the angle that the vernier scale would read when the telescope be at normal incidence i.e when the angle θ be zero one experimenter would then slowly move the telescope around take care not to miss any line of the colour for which we be look we obtain all result for the red line first then blue then indigo and would align the equipment 's crosshair with the centre of this line they would take the angle note it down and without refer to this result would move the telescope back to the centre and repeat the reading the result would then be compare give some idea of the uncertainty involve 6 the angle on the scale at θ=0 be then subtract from the value give when the line be in the centre of the field of view to give a value of θ for each maximum the result obtain be treat independently for each colour of spectral line to help identify and eliminate any anomalous result due to potential systematic error when measure the angle for a colour we then plot graph use python of sinθ against the order of the fringe m which take integer value the wavelength λ be found by rearrange equation 3 and by exploit the fact that sinθ be directly proportional to m to give the equation where d be the diffraction grate 's slit separation we then rearrange equation 2 to give which will soon be use to find the constant in the follow section the first calculation do be to find the value of d the line separation for the diffraction grate the grate be say to have 300 line per mm and so this give 3×10 5 line m -1 this value could simply be invert to give d -and the answer will be kept in it exact form to avoid unnecessary round error therefore we have a value of 𝑑 1 3×10 5 m. the result obtain for each colour line 's maximum from m=-2 to m=+2 be a follow where m be the order of maximum and θ m and θ s be the angle independently measure by each of u the angle be give in division of sixtieth of a degree because the vernier scale can be read to give angle to the near arc-minute which be the mean and the uncertainty for the angle be numerically found and then sinθ be plot against m to obtain the three follow straight-line graph for the code use to determine the gradient and error see the appendix 6 ideally error bar would be include clearly only for the y-axis give that order m only take integer value but not enough information be collect to quantitatively define these very well see conclusion the gradient for the line be obtain and then multiply by the line separation d a in equation 4 to give value for the wavelength these be then insert into equation 3 which give the follow value of the rydberg constant use the result for the red line rydberg 's constant be 10,987,139. use the result for the blue line rydberg 's constant be 10,934,464. use the result for the indigo line rydberg 's constant be 9,762,914. fortunately although the gradient of the graph may have be inaccurate due to the lack of error bar have 3 independently calculate value of the constant help to provide an alternative way to find the standard error of the result found for the rydberg constant that which corresponds to the value 𝜎 √𝑛 ⁄ the follow calculation be therefore carry out on python to find this constants=sp.array

therefore found rydberg 's constant to be 10561505.7362 with a standard error of 326259.849914 we be force to consider whether the result for indigo should be discard from the final calculation because they be below the other 2 result that be far more concordant with each other if this low value be cause by an error this would most likely be a systematic error consider the very low deviation of point from the line of best fit on the graph for indigo however since only three result be obtain for the constant we deem it unreasonable to consider this result an outlier especially since it be clearly of a similar enough magnitude to the other value so eventually by use all three of the above result our final value of the rydberg constant be calculate to be 10,562,000 ± 326,000 m -1 5sf the accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10,973,732m -1 whereas my experimental value come out a 10,562,000±326,000m -1 my maximum would therefore be 10,888,000m -1 which would still be just below the true 7 value but be not too distant the percentage error be -4 1sf which be in fact relatively small the relatively high accuracy could be consider to be down to the equipment include the very fine vernier scale and the very fine and carefully align crosshairs use to orientate the telescope there could be many potential reason for inaccuracy however include many systematic error these may in particular may have played a part in cause the value of 𝑅 ∞ from the indigo line to be low than the mean of the other two result in fact by 11 a possibility for this could be the misalignment of the spectrometer it could easily have be knock by other student walk past and we do not check in between our reading that the alignment be correct an argument against this be the cause could be that for m=0 on the indigo graph θ be a close if not closer to zero than be θ on the graph for the first two colour observedwe must therefore look to other cause it could be possible that although the high care be put into ensure that the hydrogen lamp be not left on for more than ten minute at a time there be no evidence against this mistake have accidentally be make before and during the collection of result for the indigo fringe the increase temperature of the lamp do not cause it to turn off but instead could have heat the air around it and decrease the surround pressure lead to diffraction of the photon emit a they pas through region of different pressure even before reach the grate this would give a different value of θ and therefore of 𝑅 ∞ the increase temperature may also have affected humidity -again affect diffraction another systematic error would include any slight change in lamp position although the slit remain at the same orientation a the telescope assume no problem here light would still be come in at a slightly different angle if the lamp itself be to the side another error could be confusion of the fringe with background light which be unlikely because of the clear straight-line trend show for each graph or even with other faint nearby diffraction maximum from other energy level change -or even other heat element near the lamp a for uncertainty calculation this would have be much improve by consider the actual width of the diffraction fringe -which a a matter of fact turn out to be considerably wider than the area cover by the crosshair 8 this would have give a much well estimate of the spread of value that could possibly be obtain when take result rather than compare the two experimenter result when find the angle at the fringe 's 'middle the uncertainty be therefore not found a accurately a possible -especially with the lack of error bar -but the value of 𝑅 ∞ stayed relatively true to the expect value without too large a standard error of

21,GS_MOX979_Redacted,pectroscopy be the study of the spectrum of light and how it change a light interacts with matter a spectrometer be a piece of equipment that allows for the study of spectrum by splitting light base on it wavelength when spectrum be study wavelength intensity and other property of the light beam be measure these property can give insight into anything the light have interact with before enter the spectrometer spectroscopy be use in the study of thing a small a electron to a large a star and be therefore one of the most important field of experimental physic 1 in this report the technique of spectroscopy be employ to check for the presence of the element hydrogen lithium copper and sodium in the sun 's atmosphere establish the chemical composition of star be important a it hold the key to understand star formation prove that this technique work for the sun 's atmosphere open the door for use of the technique on other star or any extrasolar entity that emits a continuous spectrum this could help far the understand of the formation of the universe to find out if one of the previously mention element be present in the sun 's atmosphere the element emission spectrum be first determine the grate spectrometer split light by wavelength and allow for the calculation of prominent wavelength the spectrum of hydrogen be obtain from a hydrogen lamp which excite hydrogen atom into emit light the sodium copper and lithium be all burn in salt form use a blowtorch the sodium and lithium be burn in their `` chloride `` salt form the chlorine require a lot more energy than the blowtorch to emit light and so the spectrum obtain be purely from the metal the same be true for the copper which be burn in it `` sulphate `` form once the spectrum of hydrogen sodium copper and lithium have be determine they be compare to the fraunhofer line these be give to the student by the lab assistant 3 the fraunhofer line be first note in 1802 by wollaston 3 in 1814 fraunhofer who the line be name after start work to determine the wavelength of the line which he label from letter a to k. these line be show in table i. forty-five year after the discovery of the fraunhofer line it be found by kirchoff and bunsen that the line coincide with the emission spectrum of element they theorise that since the light from the sun originates from fusion reaction in it core it must pa through the atmosphere where some wavelength be absorbed by element such a hydrogen this process be discus far in part b of section ii the theory section of this report this process be what cause the dark line to appear in the spectrum of the sun when view from the earth the grate spectrometer investigate fraunhofer line s the diffraction grate produce point of constructive and destructive interference at angle base on the wavelength of the light diffract through the grate a diagram of light travel through a grate can be see in fig 1. note that for an actual grate there be many more beam of light than the two show in fig 1. however by symmetry the light will interfere constructively at the same angle for all beam therefore this diagram can be use to determine the relationship between angle and wavelength a can be see in fig 1 the upper beam will travel a great optical path length than the low beam from trigonometry it can be see that this path difference will be equal to the slit separation multiply by the sine of the diffraction angle for constructive interference the optical path difference must be equal to an integer number of wavelength this give the relationship between the angle for constructive interference and the wavelength of light passing through the grate 𝑚𝜆 𝑑 sin 𝜃 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength in metre 𝑑 be the slit separation in metre this be give by the grate use 𝑚 be the order of the peak 0 for central maximum and then numbered a 1 2 3 … a 𝜃 increase and 𝜃 be the angle with the normal for that peak where constructive interference occurs to calculate the wavelength experimentally the sine of the angle which cause constructive interference can be measure for several peak the angle can then be plot against their peak 's order m the gradient of this relationship will be equal to wavelength divide by the slit separation this give the relationship 2 from 2 we can obtain 𝜆 experimentally use 𝜆 𝑑 × 𝑑 sin 𝜃 𝑑𝑚 3 provide we measure the angle of diffraction at several peak quantum mechanic tell u that an electron can only exist around an atom at certain radius these radius correspond to specific energy the low energy radius be closer to the nucleus of atom for an electron to transition between these energy level it must receive or lose all the energy instantaneously when this happens the electron usually emits or absorbs light a see in fig 2. the energy gap between orbitals vary from element to element this mean that the set of energy require to promote or demote electron in an element be unique to that element from the planck-einstein equation it be know that 𝐸 ℎ𝜈 4 where 𝐸 be the energy of a light wave in joule 𝜈 be the frequency of the light wave in hertz and ℎ be planck 's constant which be approximately 6.63 × 10 −34 𝐽 • 𝑠 from 4 it can be deduce that the wavelength of the light emit or absorbed by an electron be give by 5 where δ𝐸 be the energy difference between the two energy level and c be the speed of light which be approximately 3 × 10 8 𝑚 • 𝑠 −1 it follow from 5 that if every element have a unique set of energy gap then every element will emit and absorb a unique set of wavelength this mean that when electron in atom be demote they will emit light of specific wavelength this be know a an element 's emission spectrum an element 's absorption spectrum can be found by passing a continuous light spectrum through atom of say element the wavelength correspond to energy gap in the atom will be absorbed by the electron this leaf narrow band of low intensity in the result spectrum an element 's absorption and emission spectrum be complementary meaning that the band of low intensity in the absorption spectrum correspond to the band of emit light in the emission spectrum fig 2. two electron be demote to low energy level the energy lose be emit a electromagnetic radiation 1 iii experimental set up fig 3 show the basic part of the grate spectrometer use the spectrometer use for this experiment be the `` pasco sp-9268a `` 2 the grate employ have 2001 line per inch or around 78.78lines per mm 1 this give a slit separation of approximately 1.269 × 10 −5 𝑚. the main angle scale be comprise of separation of half a degree and the vernier read in arc minute to set up the apparatus for this experiment the grate be remove from the holder the eyepiece be then focus onto the crosshair such that it appear on an image 5-10m from the camera this be do in order to reduce eye strain a light source be then pas through the slit the camera be rotate such that the beam of light be centre on the crosshair the collimator be then focus so that a sharp image of the slit appear in the eyepiece the camera 's angle be adjust after focus to ensure that the crosshair be centre on the slit the holder in the kit use could be regulate at any angle relative to the slit for this experiment the holder have to be parallel to the slit to ensure normal incidence on the grate to do this the angle scale be use to rotate the eyepiece 90 degree from the central beam a mirror be place in the grate holder and the turntable be adjust such that grate reflect light from the slit directly into the crosshair on the eyepiece a the camera and the slit be exactly perpendicular it be then know that the mirror and therefore the holder be exactly 45 degree from the beam the scale could then be use to rotate the turntable 45 degree and the telescope 90degrees so that the light take a normal path through the spectrometer the angle on the scale be take a the `` zero `` for the experiment to take reading the light be pas through the slit and the telescope could be rotate such that the crosshair appear on the centre of the slit the angle difference between the `` zero `` angle and the angle on the scale give the value of 𝜃 for that peak a hydrogen lamp be position in front of the slit to obtain the hydrogen alpha wavelength for the metal use a salt be burn next to the slit allow light to pa through the slit the blowtorch be use to burn the metal salt a it burn at very high temperature with little visible light emission when use the blowtorch safety glass be use and the flame be kept far away from any person the data in this experiment be handle in python by the `` scipy `` function `` polyfit `` the `` polyfit `` function allows for a weight factor to be inputted into the parameter for every data point therefore to obtain more accurate value in the gradient the reciprocal of the uncertainty be use a weight factor the uncertainty give in the gradient by python be take a the random error in the final value for the hydrogen lamp the data in table ii be obtain when the hydrogen lamp be place at the slit red and blue line be observe through the lens the red line correspond to the hydrogen- wavelength the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m -6 to m 6 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table ii be plot in python to give the graph in fig 4. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0519  0.0005. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0519 × 1.269 × 10 −5 6 6.58 x 10^-7m fig 3. the grate spectrometer the light pas through the slit and then becomes parallel after passing through the collimator the grate the diffracts the light where it can be focus and view through the camera and eyepiece the diffraction angle can be read off the turntable if the camera/eyepiece be rotate such that the diffraction beam be centre on the crosshair the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two measurement be use to calculate 𝜃. to calculate the error in the sine term the percentage error in the angle be multiply by the cosine of the angle this be use a a weight factor in the python calculation of gradient 𝜃 for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.94 this give an absolute error of around ±6𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 658 ± 6 𝑛𝑚 this value corresponds to fraunhofer line c which have a wavelength of 656.6nm this result be strong evidence for the presence of hydrogen in the atmosphere of the sun in order to more thoroughly check for the presence of hydrogen the wavelength of hydrogen- and hydrogen- could be determine if they be found in the fraunhofer line then this would prove to a much high certainty that the fraunhofer line be cause by light absorption from element in the sun 's atmosphere and that hydrogen be one of them for the sodium chloride salt the data in table iii be obtain when the sodium chloride be burn next to the slit orange line be see through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be again approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m -4 to m 4 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table iii be plot in python to give the graph in fig 5. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0465  0.0003. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0465 × 1.269 × 10 −5 7 5.90 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.71 this give an absolute error of around ±4𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 590 ± 4 𝑛𝑚 this value corresponds to fraunhofer line d which be a doublet of wavelength of 589nm and 589.6nm this result would suggest that there be likely to be a presence of sodium in the sun 's atmosphere although the fraunhofer line have a doublet of wavelength only one be see in the spectrometer if a high resolution spectrometer be use then the presence of two line could be confirm to give the best possible chance of see two line with the apparatus use several change could be make a brighter sodium lamp could be use instead of a flame a this will produce a more reliable spectrum a bright lamp would also allow for a small slit which would decrease the overlap of the two line decrease the slit space would also spread the spectrum more make the two wavelength more distinct for the copper sulphate salt the data in table iv be obtain when the copper sulphate be burn the light emit be diffuse and not very bright the light see through the lens be very spread out meaning the collimator may not have be able to make all the light beam parallel the error from the width of the peak and the parallax error be much large than for the other three at 40 arc minute peak from m -5 to m 5 be visible through the eyepiece the error in 𝜃 be take a √2 × 10′ ≈ 0.2357° this be due to the fact two

define to be zero the data from table iv be plot in python to give the graph in fig 6. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0420  0.0017. from 3 we find 𝜆=0.042× 1.269 ×10−5 8 5.33 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 4.06 this give an absolute error of around ±20𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 530 ± 20 𝑛𝑚 the range of copper wavelength do correspond to fraunhofer line e which have a wavelength of 527nm however the uncertainty in the wavelength be too high to be certain that the wavelength of copper match with this line also due to what be know about star formation it be unlikely that there be high amount of copper in the sun 's atmosphere a repeat of this experiment would require a more accurate way of get the emission spectrum of copper for example burning a more flammable salt with a large flame a more sophisticated spectrometer could also be use for the lithium salt the data in table v be obtain when the lithium salt be burn next to the slit a red line be observe through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute .. peak from m -4 to m 4 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table v be plot in python to give the graph in fig 7. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit `` function be 0.0528  0.0005. from 3 we find 𝜆 0.0528 × 1.269 × 10 −5 6 6.71x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.99 this give an absolute error of around ±7𝑛𝑚 and result in a final wavelength of 𝜆 671 ± 7 𝑛𝑚 this value do not correspond to any fraunhofer line suggest little presence of lithium in the sun 's atmosphere it would seem odd that little lithium can be found in the sun 's atmosphere a it should be more easily fuse than for example sodium although the technique give good result for hydrogen and sodium the spectrum of lithium should be checked use a different method in order to verify that the wavelength measure be correct the aim of this experiment be to determine the wavelength of the element hydrogen sodium copper and lithium and to compare these to the fraunhofer line in order to determine the chemical composition of the sun 's atmosphere the wavelength found be hydrogen -𝜆 658 ± 6 𝑛𝑚 copper -𝜆 530 ± 20 𝑛𝑚 lithium -𝜆 671 ± 7 𝑛𝑚 when compare to the fraunhofer line it be found that hydrogen and sodium be present in the solar atmosphere copper and lithium be not found in the solar atmosphere however more experimentation should be carry out before this be know for certain the result from this experiment show that it be possible to determine the chemical composition of distant object through analysis of their spectrum this could be use to check for the presence of the error in 𝜃 be

22,GS_GEI074_Redacted,this report examines the use of a grate spectrometer to analyse the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom from a hydrogen lamp source three different colour spectrum in the balmer series be observe due to the high precision of the spectrometer the wavelength of the emission line and therefore the energy change accompany each transition be able to be determine very accurately by compare these value to the theoretical energy change in the balmer series the exact energy level transition be able to be identify for every colour spectrum the rydberg constant be then calculate to be 1.099 ± 0.010 × 10 7 m −1 use the rydberg equation spectroscopy be the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation 1 each element have a unique emission spectrum so spectroscopy be a useful tool for identify unknown element emission spectrum arise from the de-excitation of an electron from a high energy state to a low energy state and the simultaneous emission of electromagnetic radiation the frequency of light emit be proportional to the energy difference between the two state a discrete range of wavelength of radiation be emit due to the quantisation of electron energy level which make up the emission spectrum atom of different element have distinct energy level therefore the emission spectrum of every element be different although the hydrogen atom contains only 1 electron that usually occupies the ground state there be many empty high energy orbitals after the electron be excite to a high energy level it drop to a low state and emits electromagnetic radiation the balmer series refers to the series of spectral emission line that be characterise by transition to energy level with principle quantum number n 2 from n 2 4 of these transition result in the emission of radiation in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum however only 3 be able to be resolve clearly in this experiment 2 the colour observe be red blue and purple in the late 19th century johann jakob balmer become the first physicist to empirically describe the appearance of spectral line johannes rydberg generalise this with the rydberg equation for all hydrogen transition not just to n 2 in 1888 3 this in turn lead to the establishment of the lyman paschen and brackett series it be important to note that the rydberg equation be a strictly empirical equation and the interpretation of the hydrogen emission spectrum in term of electronic structure be not formalise until niels bohr developed his semi-classical model of the atom in 1913 3 the semi-classical bohr model use classical mechanic to describe the circular motion of electron but they could only take certain quantise value of energy depend on orbital distance the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom yield the same result a bohr 's semi-classical approach so although the bohr model be somewhat incorrect see fig 1 it be sufficient to allow the correct relationship between quantum number and electron energy level in hydrogen to be derive an electron of mass m be assume to follow a circular orbit around the nucleus at an arbitrary radius r and speed v so the centripetal and electrostatic force can be equate 5 for a hydrogen atom with only a single proton and electron with charge of magnitude e where o be the permittivity of free space bohr postulate that the angular momentum of the electron could only take discrete value i.e it be quantise where n be the principle quantum number and h be the reduce planck 's constant by rearrange and equate equation 1 and 2 the radius of the orbit electron be give by 5 where h be planck 's constant the total energy of the electron e n be the sum of the kinetic energy and electrical potential energy which after rearrangement be give by 5 clearly the electron only take certain discrete value of energy which be proportional to the reciprocal of the principle quantum number square equation 4gives the energy level of the hydrogen atom it be important to note that bohr derive this result prior to the formal establishment of quantum mechanic which involves solve the schrödinger equation for a hydrogen atom in spherical polar co-ordinate 6 the energy difference e between the high energy level n and low energy level p be equivalent to the energy emit due to the transition planck 's law state that e hc λ where c be the speed of light and λ be the wavelength of light the relationship between λ and the principle quantum number n be therefore the rydberg constant r ∞ be define in term of fundamental constant a finally the rydberg equation be give by 4 the balmer series of wavelength be obtain when p 2. the grate spectrometer use in this experiment essentially consist of 3 component collimator grate platform and telescope light from the source first travel through the collimator which ensure that light ray be parallel before reach the diffraction grate which disperse the light the disperse spectrum be then focus by a camera lens onto the crosshair with a magnify image view with the eyepiece the grate platform and telescope could be rotate and be mount on a vernier scale the main scale be in increment of 0.5 • and the vernier scale be in arcminute this meant that the precision of the spectrometer be 1 arcminute set up the spectrometer carefully be vital to eliminate systematic error in diffraction angle and to produce a clear image this ensure that precise measurement could be take in order to produce the sharpest image possible • the eyepiece be carefully focus on the crosshair which be set to an x orientation • the camera lens be focus on a far away object by look out of a window • the telescope be then rotate opposite to the collimator the collimator focus be adjust without alter the camera focus such that a sharp image of the slit could be see the diffraction grate need to be exactly perpendicular to the hydrogen lamp source such that light ray from the source be collimate and that there be no path difference before passing through the grate to do this • the telescope be place directly opposite to the collimator with the grate remove such that the slit be see on the crosshair use the vernier scale on the spectroscope the telescope be rotate through 90 • and a mirror be place in the grate holder • the grate platform be adjust such that light be reflect into the eyepiece this meant that the orientation of the grate platform be 45 • from both the telescope and the collimator • the grate platform be then rotate exactly through 45 • use the vernier scale a reference so that it be exactly perpendicular to the collimator the telescope could be move around to observe a diffraction pattern when the mirror be replace by a 80 line per mm diffraction grate • the grate platform be adjust such that the grate ruling be parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope the telescope be move into the position where the crosshair coincide with the central bright maximum which appear a a mixture of the red blue and purple light the angle of the central maximum be record and use a the reference point from which the angle θ be record for each visible fringe by rotate the telescope until the crosshair align with the line the red and blue fringe be bright and fairly easy to see although they be more space out than the purple fringe the purple fringe be quite dim and several order could not be see with the telescope include order -2 -3 and +3 for the other purple fringe it be often challenge to see the crosshair against the purple so there be a great uncertainty for these reading additionally the hydrogen lamp gradually heat up and light intensity decrease which meant that it be even harder to see the already dim purple fringe when the lamp be close to overheat the lamp be place very close to the slit so the effect of other light source be negligible all the order that could be see clearly be record for all the colour from -4 to +5 for red -5 to +7 for blue and -5 to +5 for purple exclude the miss order a state before the precision of the spectrometer be 1 arcminute however there be a variation in reading for the vernier scale each reading be therefore repeat twice with the average value take a the angle the uncertainty be take to be the standard error of the mean it be found that the provide diffraction grate have a different number of line per millimeter than be indicate by the supplier approximately 78.8 lines/mm 4 this value be use to calculate the slit separation d. by plot a graph of dsinθ against order m for each of the colour the wavelength of the light emit during each transition could be determine by find the gradient use equation 4 the theoretical energy value of each energy level can be deduce and compare to the experimental value which be calculate by inputting the measure wavelength into planck 's law the theoretical energy emit be calculate from table 1. have identify which transition each wavelength of light correspond to the reciprocal of the wavelength be plot against 1 n 2 − 1 p 2 where p 2 due to it be from the balmer series from the rydberg equation 8 the magnitude of the gradient be equal to the rydberg constant the absolute value of the gradient be 1.099 ± 0.010 × 10 7 m −1 from equation 7 the theoretical value of the rydberg constant be 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 meaning that the experimentally determine value be within 0.25 of the true value a grate spectrometer be use to observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen 3 balmer series transition correspond to light emit in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum red blue and purple fringe be observe by measure the angle of the fringe relative to the central bright maximum their wavelength be able to

23,GS_BPP712_Redacted,the rydberg constant relates the wavelength of a photon emit by an electron to the electron jump from a high to a low energy shell in order to obtain it value experimentally the light emit by a hydrogen lamp be diffract and the observable spectral line be compare to their correspond electron jump the result be r∞ 11000000 ± 26000m −1 which be large than the agree value by 0.249 i n 1888 a formula describe the wavelength of emit light from hydrogen like element be determine empirically by the swedish physicist johannes rydberg it incorporate a constant call the rydberg constant r ∞ with a value of 10973731.6m −1 ref 1 25 year later the rutherford-bohr atom model be publish and r ∞ be derive from more fundamental constant to determine the value of the rydberg constant experimentally we inspect spectral line create by hydrogen with a grate spectrometer simultaneously the formula relate the wavelength to the electron energy shell jump rydberg formula be test for validity accord to huygen 's principle a light wave encounter a grate start create new circular wave these then interfere with each other and create observable maximum and minimum two adjacent slit in a grate form a double slit it can be therefore use a a simplify model fig 1 fig 1. a planar light beam encounter a double slit and create two circular wave every blue line corresponds to a crest wavefront the distance between two adjacent line be therefore equal to the wavelength λ. the red line represent a sample of the create maximum by interference s 1 and s 2 be path that light have to travel from each slit to create a maximum a maximum can only be create if two crest interfere with each other thus s 1 and s 2 have to be multiple of the wavelength in a grate the distance between two adjacent slit d be very small when compare to s 1 and s 2 thus it might be assume that the two path be parallel fig 2 a the difference in θ between them be negligible a forward travel light wave can be described a ψ e i ωt−kx where k be define to be the wave vector and ω the wave angular frequency assume that x be in the direction of the two diffract beam then the ray in fig 2 can be define a 1 where 1 represent the amplitude with respect to location of beam 1 and 2 represent beam 2 by incorporate the additional distance of d sin θ in order to form a maximum the two wave must interfere with their crest so that the phase difference of the two wavefunctions should be a multiple m of their wavelength λ mλ arg ψ 2 − arg ψ 1 and thus for the order number m ... −2 −1 0 1 2 ... the angle θ for each create maximum be therefore only dependent on the slit width and the wavelength of the diffract light because the inspect light might consist of several wavelength their interference pattern might overlap reduce d prevents this a θ would increase for small value the most suitable atom model to obtain the rydberg constant r ∞ be the bohr model accord to which electron orbit around a positively charge and very heavy nucleus whilst be on a specific energy shell fig 3 the result centrifugal force f cent be then equal and opposite to the attractive coulomb force f coul so that the electron stay in it orbit those electron be able to move from high to low energy shell by emit energy in the form of photon and move to high energy shell by gain energy 2 the far the shell from the nucleus the more energy the orbit electron have fig 3 an equation for the wavelength of an emit photon by an electron jumping from a shell n to a shell p can be derive by use a force ansatz so that f cent f coul and thus − where z be the number of proton in the nucleus and k 1 4π 0 thus v n and r n be the velocity and radius of the electron 's movement on the n'th energy shell and m e be the electron mass this result in accord to bohr the angular momentum of every electron can be described a l n h 2π where h represent planck 's constant this be equal to the product of the electron 's moment of inertia and it angular frequency n h 2π m e r 2 n vn rn thus by substitute equation 5 into 4 r n can be define a 6 in order to determine the total energy of an electron on the nth shell e n it kinetic and potential energy need to be add the potential energy e p ot be equal to the integral from r n to ∞ over f coul with respect to r. thus rn the kinetic energy e kin can be found by divide equation 4 by 2 and so e kin kz e 2 2rn hence 2r n so if an electron jump from the n'th shell onto the p'th shell it release energy of ∆e −kz e 2 2rn − −kz e 2 2rp by substitute equation 6 the release energy be described a the energy of a photon be give by e p h hf h c λ where c be the speed of light f be the photon 's frequency and λ be the photon 's wavelength due to energy conservation e p h ∆e thus where r ∞ denotes the rydberg constant hydrogen have only one proton in it nucleus z 1 hence a hydrogen lamp creates an electrostatic field which excites electron from the hydrogen and increase their kinetic energy those electron then lose their additional energy and jump to low energy shell by emit a photon only some jump create visible wavelength which be know a the balmer series fig 5 the setup be first adjust with a sodium lamp so that the collimator the grate and the telescope ax be align for θ 0 180 o where m 0 which have to be then subtract from every measurement of the diffraction angle additionally m and θ be define to be positive in the direction up from m 0 fig 5 and negative in the opposite direction the hydrogen lamp be place a close to the slit a possible to minimise the effect of ambient light a grate with 300 line per 1mm be chosen for the experiment a accord to equation 3 the high the density of slit the easy it be to distinguish two close line from each other however a grate with a high line density could not be use a θ be become too large to be properly measure and the observe spectral line to faint at m 0 a pink/violet line could be observe fig 6a this be a combination of all the other observable colour furthermore dark blue fig 6b turquoise fig 6c and red fig 6d spectral line be observe also a very faint purple line be see but it be to faint to be record and be therefore exclude from measurement preliminary all three observe colour seem to fit into the balmer series see section iib the edge of those line be perceive a much sharper by our eye the blurriness in fig 6 be a result of bad camera quality and therefore do not affect the actual measurement quality accord to equation 3 θ be approximately proportional to λ for small value so the far a spectral line be away from m 0 the large be it wavelength therefore the correspond photon have less energy a e p h h c λ simultaneously the wavelength for each colour be determine by plot m against sin θ fig 7 a linear regression be the best approximation for the collect data for all data point intercept the regression line with their errorbars so small that not visible in graph thus equation 3 be corroborate and the slope of the linear regession be then equal to d λ where d 1mm 300 the wavelength be therefore the product of the correspond slope and 1mm 300 accord to the spectrum of visible light these wavelength roughly correspond to the observe colour in fig 6 and also to the colour emit in the balmer series fig 4 have value of λ and correspond n equation 8 can be use to determine r ∞ so λ −1 should be proportional to − 1 n 2 − 1 p 2 where p 2 and the slope would be then equal to r ∞ fig 8 the three data point align so that a justified linear regression can be conduct the result function have a y-intercept of 5700 ± 4800m −1 it should however go through the origin in order to show proportionality it value be dominate by the scale use for the y-axis the intercept can be thus neglect and a direct proportionality between the two ax can be assume a a result equation 8 be verify the slope of the function be then equal to the rydberg constant a built in vernier scale be use to measure the angle θ whose small unit be 1 arcminute 1 60 o hence the uncertainty of the measure angle be half of it σ θ 1 120 o however the observe spectral line have a certain width and the cross wire be aim at their estimate middle but this width increase the uncertainty of θ fig 9 in order to fig 9. representation of the measurement of a red spectral line on the left-hand side the cross wire be aim at the estimate middle to obtain θ. on the right-hand side the cross wire be aim at each side of the spectral line to determine ∆θ calculate the correspond error the angle of both edge of the spectral line be measure and ∆θ be then calculate for every colour for every m. the measurement error of 1 120 o be incorported a a measurement error into the calculation ∆θ be then divide by 2 a the deviation from the centre of the line can be at most only half of it width the measurement error of each possible deviation from the centre be then add to the value to simulate the large deviation this be then define a the new σ θ all value in the appendix this uncertainty of θ also incorporates the diffraction cause be the collimator and the telescope a both use glass lens the slit be well align with the lens for the centre of all wavelength for m 0 be at θ 180 o hence the lens diffraction only influence the width of the strip and not their location however for certainty all the measurement be take quickly so that the refractive index of the surround air would not change significantly due to temperature or pressure change additionally no ambient light be shin whilst the measurement be take to increase the visibility of the spectral line in fig 7 all linear regression have a small negative yintercept but they all should be theoretically equal to zero thus a systematical error might have occur low the measure value of θ. the most probable origin of this error be an inaccurate calibration of the spectrometer small value of λ would lead then to large value of λ −1 and would thus explain the positive intercept in fig 8. the official value of r ∞ be 10973731.6m −1 ref 1 our experimentally determine value be however 11000000 ± 26000m −1 the official number do therefore not lie within the value of the obtain r ∞ it be however very close a it be small by only 0.239 hence the official value of the rydberg constant be not verify by this experiment the result be very precise with an uncertainty of only 0.236 however the slope obtain from fig 8 be strongly influence by random error a only three point define the linear regression hence the validity of the result would be increase by inspect a broader span of emit photon wavelength the aim of this experiment be to determine r ∞ with a spectrometer by inspect the balmer series emit by a hydrogen lamp with a result of r ∞ 11000000±26000m −1 we be able to proof the rydberg formula however the official value of the constant be not verify the grate spectrometer be a very precise measurement technique a the final uncertainty be very small it be however prone to random error the observable spectrum be limited to the visible spectrum of electromagnetic wave between 390 and 700nm a change of the measurement device would allow gathering more data and thus the validity of the result would increase,expert,the,,,
24,GS_WHP087_Redacted,this experiment be conduct to determine the rydberg constant by use the emission spectrum of hydrogen lamp in the experiment light emit by hydrogen lamp be diffract into bright fringe and be observe through a grate spectrometer fringe with three colour red green and purple be observe for each colour the diffraction angle and order of maximum be measure and be use to determine the wavelength wavelength of each colour and their correspondent initial and final energy level be then use to calculate the rydberg constant the value calculate with the red light be 11161664.7±40600.2𝑚 −1 the value calculate with the blue light be 10956139.2±51453.5𝑚 −1 and the value calculate with the purple light be 10773444.4±12520.1𝑚 −1 atom emit light with discrete wavelength due to electron movement but light be mixed so that color can not be observe through a diffraction grate light with different wave length have different diffraction angle which separate light by their wavelength so that wavelength of emit light can be measure wavelength of light emit by an atom be call emission spectrum it be in 1855 that the emission spectrum line of hydrogen atom be precisely measure by j. j. balmer and lyman it be found to be regular and conclude into an equation call balmer equation by the former the equation be an empirical formula which show that the wavelength of the emit light by a hydrogen atom be related to 1/𝑛 2 where n be any positive integer great than 3. and the equation be developed by rydberg into rydberg equation which be consist with a wider range of spectrum over next few decade and rydberg constant be therefore introduce to fit the equation but the meaning of the equation the constant and the emission spectrum still could not be interpret until the establishment of bohr model of hydrogen atom bohr explain that the emission of light be due to the transition of electron 's energy level and the energy of emit photon equal to the change in electron 's potential energy since energy level of electron be quantize the atom can only release light with certain wave length and the rydberg constant be later deduce by bohr use his model and plank 's photon theory with 0.05 percent of error which be interpret because of the atom movement in this experiment emission spectrum of hydrogen lamp be measure through grate spectrometer and the rydberg constant be calculate figure 1 1 spectrometer theory with light passing through grate in spectrometer principal maximum occurs when light that go through all slit have instruction interference which be to say that light passing through every slit have a phase difference of 2nπ with the light passing through the neighbor slit where n be any integer δ𝜙 2𝑛𝜋 1 where δ𝜙 be phase difference between two light wave which can be also express a δ𝑟 be denote a path difference and 𝜆 be wavelength the path difference can be farther express a where d be the separation between slit which be where n be number of slit per meter and 𝜃 be diffraction angle therefore and n represent order of maximum which be to say from equation 5 it can be told that light with different wavelength have different diffraction angle therefore a mixture of light with different wavelength can be separate through a grate and wavelength of each light can be determine by the linear relationship between diffraction angle and order of maximum a mention before rydberg equation describes the relationship between the wavelength of emit light and the correspondent change in energy level in hydrogen atom accord to bohr 's equation for energy level the total energy of an electron be and plank 's photon theory the photon energy be where 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of electron e be charge per electron and n be energy level of the electron the photon energy should equal the change in energy level therefore where n and p be final and initial energy level the equation can be rearrange into which mean where r

a sodium lamp be place in front of the slit the telescope be adjust so that the crosswire inside the telescope be align with the slit the telescope then be turn exactly 90 degree by the vernier angular scale and clamped and a diffraction grate with 78.8 line per meter be set on the turn table the turntable be rotate until the crosswire of the telescope be again align with the fringe of the slit from the reflection of the grate then the telescope be unclamped and rotate exactly 90 degree back the turn table be rotate exactly 45 degree and clamped the reading on vernier scale be record a central angle 𝜃 0 which for this experiment be 96.17 degree turn the telescope the fringe of sodium lamp light can then be observe through the telescope the sodium lamp be then replace by a hydrogen lamp turn the telescope red green and purple fringe be observe for fringe with each color the rotation angle show by the vernier meter and order of maximum be record and for each fringe the width be measure a the error there should be more color but be unobservable 1. for date of each color the fit line between order of maximum and the sine function of change in rotation angle to central angle 𝜃

25,GS_SUY577_Redacted,the rydberg constant be a constant which appear in atomic physic it be use when describe the wavelength of light in numerous spectral line series in a hydrogen atom particularly the balmer series although the value of this constant have be determine before we would like to provide some experimental validation for this ultimately our setup make use of a diffraction grate and spectrometer and by the principle of superposition generates a fringe pattern which we can observe position of principle maximum be related to the wavelength of the emit light and alongside knowledge of the balmer series a value for the rydberg constant can be calculate the value we obtain from this experiment to three significant figure be 1.10x10 7 m -1 with a statistical error of approximately 2.6 systematic error contribution will be discus in detail in section 4. however we attempt to control these in our experiment and this be confirm in our result a it be close to the true value of the rydberg constant the rydberg constant be first introduce a a proportionality constant relate the wavelength of light from the atomic line spectrum of a hydrogen atom to the quantum number correspond to the energy level that the electron transition this be call the rydberg formula and can also be apply to heavier element niels bohr show that the rydberg constant could be express in term of more fundamental constant 1 where me be the rest mass of the electron e be the elementary charge on the electron εo be the permittivity of free space h be the planck constant and c be the speed of light in a vacuum to determine a value for the rydberg constant our experimental setup u a spectrometer a spectrometer be a device which show light intensity depend on it wavelength or frequency the incident light be spread out by a diffraction grate but a prism can also be use both result in a spectrum but this will be discus far in section 2. an article from 1988 title 'precision measurement of the rydberg constant by d h mcintyre and t w hänsch suggest that the accuracy of the rydberg constant have be improve beyond 1 part in 10 9 nowadays the constant have an uncertainty of less than 7 part in 10 12 1 we do n't expect to achieve this level of accuracy in our experiment but it give an idea of how well-determined this constant be the energy of an electron which be bound in a hydrogen atom can only take discrete value this be one way of say that the electron 's energy be 'quantised when an electron fall from a high energy state to a low energy state a photon of energy equivalent to difference in energy state be release this photon also have an associate wavelength the rydberg formula be one illustration of this and be show in equation 1 2 where λ be the wavelength of the emit light r∞ be the rydberg constant for hydrogen n and p be integer which represent the low and upper energy state respectively this experiment be concerned with electron which fall to the n=2 energy state a some of the emit light have wavelength within the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum this be know a the balmer series and be show in figure 2.1 spectrum of a hydrogen atom in the balmer series 3 red appear furthest to the right and then colour change from aqua to blue to violet a you move towards the left the wavelength of the light decrease but the frequency increase until you reach ultraviolet which be invisible to the naked eye the spectrometer in our experiment be couple with a diffraction grate but a mention earlier a prism may also be use the prism separate the light because different frequency of light be refract by different amount this be call dispersion our diffraction grate act like many equally space slit we know from young 's double-slit experiment that when light pas through two slit an interference pattern be form the light interferes a it pas through the slit because of the path difference and result phase difference of two light ray position of maximum intensity occur when the phase difference of the two ray be an integer multiple of 2π it can be show that position of principle maximum for many slit be described by equation 2 where d be the separation of the slit θ be the angle from the centre to desire maximum m be an integer and represent the order number and λ be the wavelength of the emit light if for example we be interested in position of principle minimum equation 2 would be modify such that the left-hand side would be multiply by n the total number of slit firstly the optical spectrometer have to be set up such that result could be take accurately and reliably this involve ensure that the spectrometer be align such that light hit the diffraction grate at exactly 90º if this be n't the case we would see a very messy fringe pattern it be also necessary to make sure that the eyepiece of the spectrometer be focus on the crosshair and that the camera lens be focus on a distant object the crosshair be much easy to see when be use diagonally these be important because the image need to be clear free from parallax and at a comfortable view distance the experimental setup be show in figure 3.1 on the follow page powerpoint to display the experimental setup of the spectrometer the hydrogen lamp serf a the light source the slit limit the amount of light into the spectrometer the collimator be necessary because it make ray parallel before they enter the diffraction grate the camera lens focus the light ray create an image which be then view through the eyepiece by an observer a diffraction grate of 80 ± 2 line per mm be use to generate the fringe pattern the fringe pattern be observe use the eyepiece and the central maximum be locate this angle be record and take a the zeroth order the main scale on the spectrometer be divide into half of a degree and the vernier scale read in arc minute the angle θ be record a a function of the order m for each transition wavelength result be take either side of the central maximum and multiple result be take to improve reliability a measurement can be take very quickly since the angle θ be measure a a function of order m equation 2 implies that a graph of m versus sin θ should be plot for each transition wavelength this will result in a straight line with a gradient λ/d this be show in figure 4.1 a see in this figure the relationship between m and sin θ be linear for both red and blue light a expect we can see that the slope for blue light be not a steep a the slope for red light we also expect to see this a blue light have a shorter wavelength than red light vertical error bar be quite small this implies a small statistical uncertainty in our gradient and this be confirm when the wavelength with an associate error be calculate for each colour for blue light we determine the wavelength to be 488 ± 12.3 nm for red light the wavelength be determine a 650 ± 17.9 nm with the wavelength know equation 2 can be use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant blue light appear on the emission spectrum because of electron drop down from the n=4 energy state to the n=2 energy state red light appear on the emission spectrum a a result of electron drop down from the n=3 energy state to the n=2 energy state plug these value into equation 2 give u an average value of the rydberg constant a 1.10x10 7 ± 2.90x10 5 m -1 however this do n't account for any systematic error which we may have encounter in the experiment it do minimise random error such a misread the scale on the spectrometer in the low light condition source of systematic error which could have affected our result might include misalignment of the spectrometer position of our hydrogen lamp air pressure humidity and unwanted background light we attempt to control most of these factor throughout the course of our experiment the spectrometer alignment be an important part of the setup and it take u much longer to do it compare with record the data we each try to set up the spectrometer we also ask the demonstrator to check our setup before proceed because we realise that the spectrometer must be align correctly to achieve accurate and reliable result our hydrogen lamp be position a close to the slit a possible and we do n't move it throughout the experiment we come to the logical conclusion that since we perform the experiment in the same environment throughout the air pressure and humidity would remain fairly constant throughout and would have a negligible effect on our result we also try to limit any background light ensure desk lamp be switch off and the door be close in the dark room we estimate that these factor would be much more noticeable if we be intend to record the rydberg constant to a much high number of significant figure for three significant figure we estimate that these systematic error altogether would contribute about 0.01 to the total error our statistical error be much high than this at the sig fig scale we be measure at and so this can effectively be ignore to conclude the aim of this experiment be to provide some empirical evidence for the current accepted value of the rydberg constant the experimental setup involve an optical spectrometer together with a diffraction grate to display the typical emission spectrum for hydrogen with knowledge of the rydberg formula and balmer series a value for the rydberg constant can be determine for a know wavelength of light we determine the rydberg constant to be 1.10x10 7 with an approximate 2.6 statistical error however we felt that this experiment do take a while to setup a the optical spectrometer have to be align correctly to produce accurate and reliable result once the spectrometer be align it be relatively easy to record measurement unfortunately we struggle to see any other colour aside from blue and red such a violet and if we could see them the intensity be very low perhaps a spectrometer with a high resolution would enable u to see these other colour more clearly we understand from our research that the rydberg formula can be apply to heavier element and a such perhaps this experiment could be extend to other element aside from hydrogen result in a more complicate emission spectrum,extended,bal,,,
26,GS_TKK454_Redacted,measurement of angle of multiple colour wavelength and order of emission line of hydrogen from the balmer series be take use a grate spectrometer this data be put into a straight line plot which allow the calculation of wavelength which meant a determination of rydberg 's constant r ∞ be calculate and compare to the accepted value through two set of separate data we arrive at two mean value of r ∞ the best value be 10552000±250400 m −1 which carry an uncertainty of 2.4 and an error on the real value of r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 of 3.9 the rydberg equation be a general form of the balmer equation found in 1885 by johann balmer through trial and error and link the wavelength of emission line in the visible hydrogen spectrum and the electron energy level change that produce them 1 the formula give by balmer be a special case for the light emit by hydrogen that fall in the visible spectrum when atom become excite their electron can undergo transition between discrete energy level these energy change result in the emission of discrete energy packet photon which have wavelength correspond to the change in energy the range of possible change of energy level in an atom produce an analogous range of wavelength of photon call a characteristic emission spectrum these spectrum can be use to identify element through spectroscopy however in this experiment a know element will be use hydrogen and the position of it emission line measure in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to take measurement of angular position of spectral line on an arcminute resolution which be a very high resolution and good for make calculation to many significant figure because of the nature of a diffraction grate multiple 'orders or repeat of each colour of emission line can be observe use the spectrometer relationship between wavelength and angular position give in 2 we can plot a straight line graph from which the wavelength of each emission line can be calculate each different wavelength allows a separate calculation of r ∞ and compare our result to the real value allows a benchmark of our experimental technique to be make against high-level experimental determination a grate of 80 l.p.m be use instead for our first set of data take on january 23 2018 but then a second set of data be take january 30 2018 with a 300 l.p.m for comparison a hydrogen lamp be use a our source for our data a it give three well-defined visible spectral line but a sodium lamp be use in the setup of the apparatus a sodium lamp can be left on for longer without overheat the rydberg empirical equation be where n be the initial energy level of an electron in the atom n ∈ n and p be the final energy state p ∈ n p n. in the case of the balmer series p 2. this equation be relevant to this experiment a it describes the visible wavelength produce by hydrogen the balmer series be simply the result of the transition of electron from the n th state to the 2 nd low state in a diffraction grate light diffracts through microscopic slit of which there be of the order of 10 or 100 in a millimetre this cause the diffract light wave to interfere with each other and create light and dark fringe this allows the light that be generate by our source to be amplify into bright peak and mean that each wavelength be repeat in several fringe or 'orders figure 1 indicates figure 1 the path of monochromatic light wave diffract through a grate source 2 the path difference of wave that be travel through separate slit the line ac the condition that these wave must fulfill in order to constructively interfere and make a bright fringe be that they must be in phase at the point of observation this mean that the path difference must be some integer multiple of wavelength which lead to the equation where m be order such that m ∈ n and d be line space in metre this show that a graph of sin θ against m should be a straight line of gradient λ d a d be a constant calculate from where α be the number of line per millimetre in the diffraction grate α ∈ 78.8 300 α 78.8 be for the 80 l.p.m diffraction grate 2 we can calculate λ from this value of λ can be use in balmer 's equation subsituting the know value for n and p for each colour give in table 1 r ∞ can be calculate use the equation 5 which will allow u to make a comparison to the accepted value and hence comment on the accuracy of the experiment the spectrometer be calibrate carefully in order to obtain sharp spectral line across the order in the plane of the eyepiece to make measurement a accurate a possible figure 2 and 3 show clearly the adjustment mechanism that be use to calibrate the spectrometer when look through the eyepiece the observer see a crosshair over the image which be use to make fine visual alignment a show in figure 4. the eyepiece be focus onto the crosshair so it be sharp the telescope lens be then focus by position it near a window and adjust the objective lens until very distant object distance 10m become resolve this be to focus the camera on a point at infinty or close to so that parallax in the eyepiece be minimise without a diffraction grate in place the sodium light source be position in front of the slit and the telescope be move until the crosshair overlap the single emission line from the collimator indicate that the telescope and collimator be parallel it be at this point necessary to adjust the slit so that the line be a narrow a possible whilst still visible to make the position accurate when adjust the telescope position large movement be make by unscrew the fasten screw a label in figure 2 when the telescope be in approx-imately the right place the screw be fasten again and the fine adjustment screw be use to align the crosshair perfectly at this parallel position the reading on the vernier scale be take the angular vernier scale do not provide an absolute angle from a reference point but be instead use for relative measurement this measure value from the vernier scale become our 0 • reference point this reference point be use to rotate the telescope in the horizontal plane 90 • relative to the reference point and hence the collimator a mirror be then insert into the grate holder and the grate table be rotate without affect the vernier scale measurement such that a reflection of the light from the collimator be visible and align with the crosshair base on the principle of reflect light angle of incidence be equal to the angle of reflection this told u that the grate be orient at 45 • to both the collimator and the telescope and the table could then be rotate exactly 45 • use the vernier scale it be then geometrically sound to reason that the grate be in the plane perpendicular to the collimator within a tolerance dictate by the uncertainty on the vernier scale reading which be discus in 6. with the grate stand perpendicular to the collimator the grate table be lock in place to avoid the need for recalibration the mirror be then replace with the grate of choice 80 l.p.m then 300 l.p.m and the table adjustment screw be use to adjust the height and plane orientation of the table until the spectral line from the diffraction grate be in the plane of the telescope across a wide range of angle if the table be not align properly then measurement at high order would be make more difficult and less accurate a they would be in a plane not parallel to the horizontal this be show in figure 5. figure 5 a skew line which would be typical if the table be not correctly adjust this would be more visible at high order it be clear to see that it be not possible to easily define where a measurement should be take in this instance this setup process be follow closely from the lab manual 6 during the first attempt at the setup process the table alignment step be not follow properly a 300 l.p.m grate be be use a it be advise that this would yield clear order for each colour which would reduce confusion however before a full set of data could be take two thing be apparent primarily that the intensity of the spectral line be diminshing very quickly a order increase and so few data point could be take for each colour secondly that the spectral line be deviate from the horizontal this orientation problem be correct and then the grate switch in order to take more data point the main calculation of uncertainty do on the data come from the calculation of uncertainty on the gradient of our graph which be do computationally from the standard deviation of the data point around the regression line in python 's scipy package more data point make the value of deviation more reliable hence why the 80 l.p.m grate be eventually chosen the downside of this be that the order be not a well define -lines of very different order could be found very close to one another this be easily manage by keep good track of the order of each line a the measurement be be take for the 80 l.p.m grate a set of data be take by rotate the telescope through anticlockwise from the 0 • position a this reduce the reading on the vernier scale the absolute angle be negative which meant that the value of order that data be be take for be also negative a the telescope be move through the position and colour of each spectral line observe be record alongside it order this be do until the spectral line diminish to a point where accurate determination of position or order be no longer possible from this position the telescope be swept through again take a set of repeat measurement on the way back to 0 • for the sake of time measurement be not take for order ≥ 1. the raw measurement of angle be record and from them our sero position value be subtract to obtain a correct absolute value of angular position our zero position value be 220 • 10 or 220.17 • 2d.p the 300 l.p.m grate be use to generate a second set of data after the first experiment be perform this be to compare the value of r ∞ for each grate in order to combat the rapid diminish of order that be face with the grate measurement of order both less than and great than 0 be take whereas only order 0 be take with the 80 l.p.m grate repeat be also take for each value measure use the 300 l.p.m this meant there be enough data point to compute error calculation with however there be still distinctly few data point for each colour a discus in 3 each measurement carry an estimate ±3 or 0.05 • uncertainty a discus in 2 the graph of sin θ against order m yield a gradient of λ d therefore for each grate a linear plot be generate for each colour this allow an analysis of the gradient to be perform and λ calculate which in turn allow r ∞ to be calculate for each wavelength use equation 5. in analysis the graph plot for the measurement of angle and order take show a strong linear trend a expect however by inspection it be clear that the result already be not perfect table 2 7 show the wavelength of the line that we see in the hydrogen emission spectrum colour wavelength nm red 656 blue 434 purple 410 it be therefore clear that red should have a steeper line than the other two a gradient ∝ λ. however figure 6 show red be almost parallel to the line for purple the value of λ obtain from the gradient in figure 6 use equation 4 with d 1.27 × 10 −5 from equation 3 be thus present in the table below colour wavelength nm purple 600 ± 57 blue 485.9 ± 1.5 red 830 ± 151 these value be far from accurate and in the case of red and purple they be not precise either the value of wavelength for red be outside the visible range and the value for purple be close to the know value of red wavelength where it should be much low which indicates that there have be some error in the take of data when the measurement be be take the blue spectral line be the easy to see clearly and many more order be visible this be most likely why the value of position for blue be the best because the deviation around blue be the small it error have be quote to 2 d.p a there be great reason to say that it value be know to a high place of accuracy these value and their associate uncertainty be then use in equation 5 to calculate their respective value of rydberg 's constant these be give below colour r ∞ /m −1 purple 7490000 ± 710000 blue 9800000 ± 30250 red 8700000 ± 1580000 these value give a mean value of r ∞ 8660000±1730000 m −1 the discussion of uncertainty for both wavelength and r ∞ be give in 6. use the data from the 300 l.p.m grate another graph be plot similar to before see in figure 7. figure 7 figure 7 the graph for the 300 l.p.m grate show a much more intuitive set of data with the exception of the value of purple at order -3 which fall below the line but carry a large error and so do not influence the line heavily the line all show strong linearity it be also immediately clear that the purple and blue line be close in gradient and that red be much steeper a we expect previously but be not confirm by figure 6. the value of wavelength for this set of data be give in the below table colour wavelength nm purple 434 ± 3 blue 459 ± 10 red 659 ± 5 this show a remark improvement in the likeness of the data to the expect value for wavelength the uncertainty be also more consistent although interestingly blue carry a large uncertainty than the others contrary to the previous set of data these value of wavelength lead to the follow value of rydberg 's constant the uncertainty related to measurement on the vernier scale be subject to estimation a one issue with the precision of the experiement be that it be difficult to say to which arcminute the scale be reading to often multiple line would look close to be align which make the reading hard to give to a fine accuracy an estimate uncertainty of ±3 will be use for angle measurement where denotes arcminute or 1 60 th of a degree a this cover the number of line either side of a give reading that could have also be read a align or close to align this uncertainty of ±0.05 • be include in the calculation of the errorbars on the graph these errorbars be calculate use interpolation of the sine function for each order the error on sin θ σ be calculate use where θ be the mean value of θ take from the two repeat of each point σ θ be the standard deviation on θ calculate use the standard deviation formula on the two datapoints for each order and σ v ernier be the measurement uncertainty from the vernier scale reading σ v ernier 0.05 • all the value be transform to radian before the sine function be use in 6 and 7 a represent the minimum possible estimation of θ i.e the low bound and b represent the upper bound by find half the difference between the sine of a and b we be interpolate linearly in the boundary between the upper and low bound of angle although sine be not a linear function this be still a good estimate a the range between bound for each angle be very small and so the function can be approximate a a linear segment in this interval with negligible error this be prove by the fact that the errorbars on the graph be very small in most case invisible even though the scipy.errorbar function be use to plot them a the errorbars be so small yet the variation of the point around the line be so large it would be irresponsible to say that they be the best estimation of error for λ. a far well estimation of error be the measure of spread around the regression line this be calculate use scipy.polyfit which generates fit parameter for the regression line and also return a covariance matrix c. each point on the line be give a weight w such that w 1 σ which mean the uncertainty from the vernier measurement and the deviation of the repeat value be propogated appropriately the small the error the great the line lean toward that point the uncertainty on the gradient be found use which be the most comprehensive measurement of error on gradient and therefore λ. λ be calculate from the gradient use equation 6. it be reasonable to assume that there be no significant error on d due to manufacturing to estimate the uncertainty on our value of rydberg 's constant the general formula for uncertainty of any function z x a give by which in the case of equation 5gives the mean value of r ∞ calculcated in 5.1 and 5.2 be calculate use the arithmetic mean and the uncertainty value found from add all the other uncertainty in quadrature the mean value of r ∞ 8660000±1730000 m −1 and 10552000± 250400 m −1 both compare differently to the know value of r ∞ 10973731.6m −1 2 the first value have an error of 22 and an uncertainty of 20 both of which be large and indicate that the experimental technique use be flaw it be most likely that the setup be perform incorrectly which lead to a systematic error in the reading of the angle there could also have be an exaggerated effect of random error from reading the vernier scale due to inexperience with reading that type of scale the second value from the 300 l.p.m grate be notably the well value it carry a 3.9 error on the real value which be far more accurate to the level expect of the apparatus use the uncertainty on the value itself be 2.4 which be again a reasonable level of precision that one would expect from the use of a spectrometer which be inherently a precise piece of equipment the majority of this error would have be random and originates from the vernier scale reading a before but there be clearly less systematic error affect this repeat data from the set of data for the 300 l.p.m grate the value for r ∞ calculate from the red wavelength be the most accurate value and carry less uncertainty than the mean a it be the value correspond to the blue wavelength that be responsible for most uncertainty on the mean value from this value of r ∞ 10926000 ± 84200 m −1 the error on the know value be only 0.4 and the uncertainty be 0.8 and so unlike the two mean value the real value of rydberg 's constant fall within the uncertainty of this value this be extremely accurate and although the measurement equipment use have the potential to be very accurate it be debateable whether this value be representative of the experiment give that it be the only value that be this accurate and precise in conclusion the final value of rydberg 's constant from this experiment shall be quote a the mean value r ∞ 10552000 ± 250400 m −1 a it take into account the majority of datapoints take and give a good level of error and uncertainty and be clearly less systematically erroneous than the mean value

27,GS_TFY667_Redacted,"this project investigates the measurement of wavelength in the hydrogen spectrum use a grate spectrometer in order to ultimately deduce a value for the rydberg constant wavelength be measure for blue aqua and red emission line which be calculate to be 434.8 ± 2.4 nm 486.9 ± 1.3 nm and 659.6 ± 2.2 nm respectively with their true value be 434nm 486nm and 656nm 1 the rydberg constant be then deduce to be 10940685.2 ± 12293.4 m −1 which be accurate with a 0.3 error compare to the theoretical value of 10973731.6 m −1 2 spectrometer be use to examine the spectrum of light such that wavelength of light over the range of continuous absorption or emission line spectrum can be calculate with emission line spectrum emit by hot gas spectroscopy can be use to measure the width of the spectral line in order to determine property of the emit gas spectrometer be incredibly accurate device that can be use to study flame star plasma and semiconductor 2 for example in astronomy they can be use to measure the age rotational velocity and recessional velocity of interstellar object 3 the aim of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant use this spectroscopy technique involve a grate spectrometer on the emission line spectrum produce by hydrogen gas this be a physical constant that appear in the balmer formula for the spectral line of a hydrogen atom in order to do this the wavelength of the emission line be calculate by measure their diffraction angle after passing through the grate spectrometer emission line spectrum occur when hot gas emit spectrum and be present a a few define line of different colour which correspond to the specific wavelength of light emit by the gas these spectral line be unique to each element so can be use to identify them 1 for example the emission line spectrum for hydrogen can be show in fig 1. when an electron in an atom receives energy for example from heat the electron move to a high energy level cause the atom to be in an excite state however this state be unstable a atom be most stable in their ground state so the electron return to a low energy level by release it excess energy a a photon in the case of a hydrogen atom fig 1. the emission line spectrum produce by hydrogen gas show the four specific wavelength emit on the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum violet blue aqua and red this be what should be view during the experiment through the spectrometer the violet line be weak so sometimes can not be see image adapt from 1 there be multiple energy state that electron transition can occur between quantum mechanic suggests that these energy level exist discretely therefore the emit photon have discrete energy and specific wavelength such that where e be the energy of the photon h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light in a vacuum and λ be the wavelength of the photon this mean the presence of spectral line can be explain by quantum mechanic 4 fig 2. possible electron transition show how they relate to the balmer and lyman series for any atom the high energy level that the electron transition from can be from any number up to infinity but it be the energy level that the electron transition to that determines the series 5 the great the energy difference between the two transition state the shorter the wavelength of the emit photon a it have more energy if the energy difference be great enough the wavelength may be too short to be in the visible spectrum so would not be detect by the spectroscope a it lie in the ultraviolet range likewise if the energy difference be very small the wavelength may be too long to be in the visible spectrum so also would not be detect by the spectroscope a it lie in the infrared range the possible energy transition for hydrogen atom that emit photon in the visible range be from high level to the second orbital energy level this transition to the second energy level be know a the balmer series this idea of energy level and electron transition can be show in fig 2. the balmer series be where electron transition to n 2 from n ≥ 3 where n be the principal quantum number or energy level of the electron 4 in hydrogen both visible light transition and ultraviolet transition form the balmer series with ultraviolet transition also form the lyman series infrared transition form the paschen and pfund series the lyman paschen and pfund series have transition from high energy level to the first third and fourth energy level respectively 6 there be four wavelength displayed in the visible light spectrum for hydrogen 410nm 434nm 486nm and 656nm which correspond to the colour violet blue aqua and red respectively 1 the other balmer line with wavelength shorter than 400nm be in the ultraviolet spectrum and be not visible therefore in order for spectral line to appear on the visible light spectrum the electron transition must emit a photon of the correct wavelength the high energy level which the electron can transition from in order to do this have the quantum number n 6. the spectrometer can be use to view these spectral line by use a lens to produce a collimate beam of light which it disperses with a grate this disperse spectrum be then focus and view with an eyepiece the component that make up the spectrometer can be show in fig 3. fig 3. schematic diagram of the spectrometer and the three main component that make it up the collimator diffraction grate and the telescope the telescope can be consider a the camera and eyepiece this show the path that light take from the source through the device to the eyepiece where the spectral line can be view 2 light from the source travel through a narrow slit where it enters the spectrometer a collimate lens in the spectrometer make the beam parallel therefore all the light ray hit the diffraction grate at the same angle of incidence where this diffract light be then focus onto a cross-hair x by a camera lens an eyepiece be use to view a magnify image of the disperse spectrum 2 the grate consists of many equally space narrow slit with the slit separation be d. the light with wavelength λ diffracts through these slit and the diffract beam interfere with each other the diffraction effect be optimal with maximum wavefront curvature when the grate space have a similar magnitude to the wavelength of the incoming ray a maximum occurs when diffract ray interfere constructively so phase difference between neighbour ray be an integer multiple n of 2π where path difference be dsinθ with θ be the diffraction angle therefore where n represent a positive or negative order number this path difference be displayed in fig 4. the wave be out of phase so interfere destructively to form point of minimum when the path difference be nλ 2 the wave be in phase so interfere constructively to form point of maximum in both case n be an even integer transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by where n be an integer represent the energy level of the initial state of the atom and p be an integer represent the energy level of the final state of the atom here due to the balmer series in hydrogen for the visible spectrum p 2 and n 3,4,5 ... a the electron drop down from a high energy level to the second energy level 2 the rydberg constant be r ∞ which have a theoretical value of 10973731.6 m −1 and can be described in term of fundamental constant where c be the speed of light m e be the mass of an electron h be planck 's constant and α be the fine constant which can be define a where 0 be the permittivity of free space firstly we have to set up the spectrometer to ensure that it be properly align and focus in this way it could be use to make accurate measurement competent of precision of under three part in ten thousand the focus ensure that there be no parallax between the image and cross wire and the telescope need to be align with the axis of the collimator the eyepiece be focus onto the cross wire so that the image be at a convenient view distance without eye strain the camera lens be then focus by view a distant object roughly 5-10 metre away through the lens and focus this object onto the cross wire we place the sodium lamp in front of the slit to illuminate it turn the light off in the room to make this more effective a sodium lamp be use a the light source for set up the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp use later for take measurement would overheat if left on for too long we adjust the collimator 's focus without modify the camera focus until the image of the slit be sharply focus onto the cross wire the clamp screw and slow-motion drive be then adjust in order to align the camera and cross wire so that the cross wire be set on the slit image the slowmotion drive allow the camera to be rotate smoothly and by precise amount we rotate the cross wire a we found that they be most easily use when marked a an x instead of a '+ we move the telescope through exactly 90 degree use the rotation drive and clamped it in position there be two scale use in order to do this precisely the main scale divide into half of a degree and the vernier scale divide into arc minute a mirror be place in the grate holder and the grate table rotate until we could see the reflect image of the slit in the eyepiece once this occur we knew that the mirror be at 45 degree to the incident beam from the collimator we use the adjustment screw under the grate table to modify the height of the image and the grate drive to set the mirror so that the slit image be precisely at the cross wire use the reading that the telescope be set at when it be 90 degree we then rotate the mirror through exactly 45 degree so that it be accurately set at 0 degree incidence to the normal we then move the telescope back 90 degree so that it be at 0 degree orientation the spectrometer be now focus and align so measurement could be take 2 the mirror be replace with a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm and the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen gas lamp through the eyepiece the emission line spectrum of hydrogen could be view a we rotate the telescope use the slow-motion drive for each transition wavelength we measure the diffraction angle θ a a function of order m for positive and negative m value from the zeroth order the reading on the scale be note at the zeroth order a the reference value which be deduct from each transition wavelength reading to get θ. reading be record in degree and then arcminute use both the scale for some wavelength we found that we could obtain more order than for others a others grow dimmer faster for example blue we manage to obtain θ and m value for blue aqua and red line but not purple line for each colour wavelength record a graph of sinθ against m could be plot from equation 3 the gradient of this graph be λ d so the wavelength of each colour spectral line could be calculate from multiply the gradient by the grate space use equation 4we calculate the rydberg constant for each wavelength then could use these to obtain an average value for the constant the result for the variation of sinθ against order m for blue spectral line be present in fig 5. the error bar be barely visible a they be so small that they may be consider negligible this be due to the precision of the spectrometer the gradient of the slope be 3.43 ± 0.0192 x 10 −2 the diffraction angle θ be a function of the reference value and the record angle both of which have an error of half an arc minute a this be half an increment on the vernier scale therefore this error be add twice in quadrature to calculate the error in θ which be propagate through use function error to calculate the error in sinθ use equation 3 the gradient multiply by the grate space be equal to λ which can be calculate to be 434.8 ± 2.4 nm have a 0.56 uncertainty the theoretical value of the wavelength for blue spectral line here be 434nm which lie within the uncertainty therefore there be only a 0.18 error in our result show that it be extremely accurate with the wavelength calculate equation 3 can be use to calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ use the balmer series n 5 for blue wavelength r ∞ be 10953123.1 ± 61473.1 m −1 this be an uncertainty of 0.56 and an error of 0.19 from the theoretical value of 10973731.6 m −1 therefore our result here be very accurate also because the theoretical value lie within the uncertainty of our calculate result the result for the variation of sinθ against order m for aqua spectral line be present in fig 6. the gradient of the slope be 3.84 ± 0.0104 x 10 −2 use this the wavelength for aqua be calculate to be 486.9 ± 1.3 nm a 0.27 uncertainty error be calculate in the same way a described for the blue wavelength this compare to the theoretical value of λ be 486nm so our result have an error of 0.19 and be thus very accurate from the balmer series n 4 for aqua wavelength so r ∞ can be calculate from this data to be 10952833.7 ± 29572.5 m −1 this be an uncertainty of 0.27 and have an error of 0.19 compare to the theoretical value this result be also very accurate due to the small percentage error and because the theoretical value lie within the uncertainty of the r ∞ we calculate in the same way a the previous two colour the wavelength for red could be calculate from the plot of sinθ against order m which be present in fig 7. the gradient of the slope be 5.2 ± 0.017 x 10 −2 this lead to the calculate wavelength to be 659.6 ± 2.2 nm which be a 0.33 uncertainty the theoretical value of λ be 656nm therefore our result have a 0.55 error which be slightly large than the error calculate in the other wavelength but be still very small thus our result be accurate use n=3 from the balmer series for red wavelength r ∞ can be calculate to be 10916098.9 ± 35895.6 m −1 this have a 0.33 uncertainty and have a 0.53 error so this result be very accurate despite have a large error than the previous value calculate for r ∞ to deduce an overall value for r ∞ for this experiment the mean of the three r ∞ value calculate for the individual wavelength on the emission line spectrum for hydrogen be take this prove to be 10940685.2 ± 12293.4 m −1 with the error calculate use standard error of the three r ∞ value this result have a 0.09 uncertainty and a 0.3 error from the theoretical value both of which be very small thus fig 7. the result for sinθ plot against the order m for the red spectral line observe with the spectrometer with precise value and a strong positive correlation there be again negligible error bar however the error in this gradient be large than the error in the gradient of fig 5 and fig 6. prove the accuracy of this result and that systematic error be unlikely the main error take into account although very small be the human error in take reading from the scale we take this to be half an increment on the vernier scale -0.5 arc minute this be because the room be dark and the scale be very small to read so we have to use a magnify glass this error be propagate throughout equation 3 and 4 and then combine with the standard error of multiple data set to calculate the overall error in r ∞ a show in table 1 the r ∞ value calculate for each different colour photon be always slightly below the theoretical value despite all still be very accurate this may have be cause by a small systematic error there be several possible cause of this systematic error a we have to consider the effect of spectrometer misalignment defocus lamp position grate period air pressure and humidity and background light defocus seem unlikely because the emission line be very sharp and in focus the most likely cause of this systematic error be probably a slight misalignment in the spectrometer this may have explain why all the wavelength value calculate for each spectral line be slightly large than their theoretical value and thus the rydberg constant be always small furthermore θ value should have be the same for positive and negative order of the same magnitude however some be out by 0.5 which highlight how there be a small spectrometer misalignment the spectral resolution of the diffraction grate be limited to the grate period d. to obtain a high spectral resolution grate should be of a very large size or there should be a high number density of slit however this be difficult due to the high-precision process of the spectrometer 7 the grate period calculate from the number of line per mm give on the grate slide may not have be the exact value of the period but in fact slightly large which would explain the slightly large wavelength calculate other factor to consider be air pressure and humidity the theoretical wavelength value give be for those photon travel through a vacuum however the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in air be small to that in a vacuum this be primarily due to the atmosphere have a refractive index that affect the curvature of the electromagnetic path 8 this refractivity of air be dependent on pressure temperature and humidity a they all affect the density of air in a vacuum pressure be far low than the atmospheric pressure experienced in the room there be also matter in the air but not in a vacuum which affect the path of the diffract wave therefore take measurement for pressure temperature and humidity and use formula the density of the room can be calculate in order to calculate the refractive index n of air in the room this can be use to convert the value obtain for wavelength into the wavelength in a vacuum a λ vac nλ air 9 these new value could then be use to calculate r ∞ on the other hand the experiment can be conduct in a vacuum chamber to make the wavelength value more accurate to the theoretical vacuum value background light may have make it harder to view certain order a although external light do n't affect the position of spectral line it affect their relative intensity to the background view through the spectrometer this may have affected how for each colour photon we always found more negative order than positive order a positive and negative order be suppose to be symmetrical about the zeroth order in the same way our lamp position may have obstruct the view of some emission line so some be too faint to be see therefore to improve we could have turn all lamp off before take reading a we may have see more emission line at full intensity and we perhaps could have obtain more data point lead to an even more accurate gradient we may also have see the fourth violet emission line a this be include in the visible range for hydrogen emission line this would increase precision of result and the accuracy of the calculate rydberg constant the aim of the experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant r ∞ by use a grate spectrometer to calculate the transition wavelength produce in the visible range of the emission line spectrum for hydrogen gas our result for the wavelength r ∞ be very accurate and close to the true value with r ∞ calculate to be 10940685.2 ± 12293.4 m −1 only have a 0.3 error the spectrometer be use effectively to give precise measurement for value of the diffraction angle θ against order m and we be able to obtain value of θ for order of high magnitude up to 12 for aqua emission line the main error account for be the human error in take reading from the vernier scale on the spectrometer however small systematic error be consider in the data analysis a although our result be incredibly accurate they be n't perfect and be all out by a similar amount to improve the experiment perhaps multiple reading could have be take with the experiment repeat and the mean reading record to reduce uncertainty and human error possible systematic error could be take into account such a consider the effect of the atmosphere 's refractive index on the wavelength of the photon and thus conduct the experiment in a vacuum chamber measurement could have be take in order to make estimation for possible systematic error or to determine them which could then be include in the calculation of error also all background light should be eliminate in order to view the spectral line easily a perhaps more could have be observe",deep,exp,,,
28,GS_NPG050_Redacted,"the aim of the experiment be to measure the spectrum of vaporise hydrogen from a hydrogen lamp and determine the wavelength of the spectral line use this we calculate the rydberg constant for each spectral line and found an average and take the standard error the final value of the rydberg constant we obtain be 1.092x10 7 ± 3.180x10 4 m -1 this be a highly precise experiment generate a percentage error of only 0.291 the set up consists of a simple spectrometer with a 78.8 lines/mm diffraction grate and a hydrogen lamp the spectrometer can measure in the vernier scale the small increment of measurement be 1 arcminute we measure the angle at which each order of the spectral line appear after be diffract and plot a sin angle against order graph to determine the wavelength of the spectral line the wavelength be then use with rydberg formula to determine the constant spectrometry be a technique of use em radiation and in specific case also use the mass of an ion and magnetic field to determine the structure or the composition of a material or an object diffract light from a material or the amount of ion deflection in a magnetic field be analyse 1 in our experiment we be focus on the emission spectrum of hydrogen gas a a potential difference v across the filament in the hydrogen lamp be apply the gas be heat and cause the atom to be excite the electron in the atom be promote to a high energy level and then fall to a low energy level energy equivalent to the difference in the energy level be release in the form of a photon 2 the energy level be fix and so only photon with discrete wavelength be release therefore each element or compound have a unique spectral pattern in this experiment we be observe the balmer series in hydrogen this be to say we be look at wavelength of photon generate from an electron transition from a high level n=3,4,5… to energy level p=2 this produce photon in the visible spectrum this can be see in the rydberg formula give by eq 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 𝑛 be the energy level high than 2 and 𝑝 be the 2 nd energy level 3 the light in the spectrometer can diffract through a diffraction grate the wavelength of each spectral line can be determine by the diffraction formula give by eq 2 where ⅆ be the distance between the slit in the diffraction grate 𝜃 be the angle at which the order appear in radian 𝑚 be the order at which the spectral line appear where m 0 ±1 ±2 etc and 𝜆 be the wavelength pf the spectral line 4 the central order m =0 will appear at 𝜃 =0 at the central order all the spectral line will be overlap the set up consists of a simple spectrometer with a 78.8 lines/mm diffraction grate and a sodium or hydrogen lamp the set up can be see in fig 1. sodium lamp be use to ready the spectrometer a it produce high intensity light and have a longer operational time than the hydrogen lamp however the sodium lamp do take some time about 2 minute to reach maximum intensity it have a manageable warm up time this overall make the set up of the spectrometer much easy a time can be take to make fine adjustment the disadvantage of use a hydrogen lamp instead of shin light through a vial of vaporise hydrogen and measure an absorption spectrum be that lamp only remains bright enough to make measurement of the low wavelength light for about 10 minute it also only have an operational time of 20 minute this meant that the measurement have to make quickly this however be still more manageable than the alternate method of produce the hydrogen spectrum a the light emit through the hydrogen may have it own spectrum this may lead to confusion when analyse the overall spectrum the sodium lamp be set up in front of the slit and the slit be narrow the intensity of light from the sodium lamp be high and the narrow slit provide a high resolution of the spectral line the resolution be the ability to separate two spectral line and see them discretely the spectral line be then focus use the focus nob the spectral line be ensure to be vertical by place a filter that block some light and turn the line into small dot it be important to ensure that the

adjust until the line appear to be dot the filter be then taped on to the slit securely hold it in position the head of the spectrometer be rotate from left to right and we observe if the crosshair

see in fig 2 the diffraction grate be also place such that it be perpendicular to the slit and lens array in front of the lamp preliminary data of the order and angle at which the order appear be make use the sodium lamp here we notice that it be best to make measurement by rotate the head in one direction ie go from m= -4 to m=4 rather than start at the m=0 and change direction after reach the high order this be because change direction occasionally cause the spectrometer to shift a it be not fix to the table finally we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be place such that it be closer to the slit and the centre of the lamp face the slit the centre of the lamp be the brightest part of it the slit be also make to be a bit wider than before this allow more light into the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp be dimmer than the sodium lamp this however decrease the resolution of the spectral line the spectrometer be refocus and measurement be make first we slowly move from the 0 th order a this be the easy to identify to the -4 th order which we define to be in the clockwise direction then we measure the angle at which the red spectral line appear make sure to keep the crosshair in the centre of the line this be do by use the fine adjustment screw locate on the base we then measure the angle of the subsequent order of the red line until we reach m +4 we then repeat the same technique with the blue and purple line the observe spectral pattern of hydrogen can be see in fig 3 and the data of the angle of each order for each spectral line can be see in appendix a. a see in fig 3 the pattern also contains a rainbow artefact this be due to light from the surround enter the spectrometer if the experiment be do in perfectly dark condition then

hydrogen lamp be use in order to measure the diffraction angle of emission line which be in turn use to find the wavelength of emit photon which could be use with the rydberg formula to calculate a value of the rydberg constant photon will be emit from a gas when it be hot a electron that have become excite to high energy level be prone to spontaneous emission in which the electron fall from a

next the crosshair be to be align with the image of the slit and the focus of the collimator adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the crosshair the angle which the telescope be currently

31,GS_UGX035_Redacted,troscopy method with a hydrogen lamp the aim be to determine a value for the rydberg constant while investigate the effectiveness of the grate spectrometer in study the spectrum of light a value of 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 be obtain for the rydberg constant this result highlight the successful operation of the grate spectrometer because a precise result be found wavelength of 656.1 ± 2.7 nm 490.8 ± 3.4 nm and 439.8 ± 6.0 nm be calculate for red aqua and blue photon respectively these intermediate result far show the effective use of the spectrometer in achieve precision the result be only a little inaccurate because within experimental uncertainty it do n't quite agree with the accepted value of 10 973 736.6 m 1 for the rydberg constant this be due to a small systematic error t he grate spectrometer be a device that be construct with a specific pathway for light spectroscopy involves the study of spectrum by take measurement of radiation and this device be just one of many that can be use for this purpose electromagnetic radiation be able to pa through the spectrometer via a slit and then a collimator grate and camera before enter an eyepiece for observation the grate spectrometer be a great tool and can be use to show relationship between many quantity through the calculation of specific wavelength and constant like that of the rydberg constant this ability to identify relationship mean it have great importance with it application for example the result it be capable of produce allow the determination of gas temperature and density on a small scale and the velocity of galaxy with respect to each other on a large scale 1 exploit these experimental property meant that the rydberg constant could be found by take measurement of the emission spectrum produce by a hydrogen lamp specifically it be the analysis of interference pattern produce by the grate for different wavelength that contribute to the calculation diffraction be a process that result in the spread of wave a they pa an aperture or edge electromagnetic radiation can be consider to occur in waveform so it be able to undergo this phenomenon in the case of the grate spectrometer there be a diffraction grate which act a multiple aperture a the light wave pas through the aperture diffraction will occur and this will be more observable when the width of the aperture be similar to that of the light wavelength the grate consists of many narrow slit which have the same width and be separate equally each slit cause diffraction to occur and therefore interference can also happen this be because the light wave from each slit will cross path and superimpose path difference be the respective difference in distance travel by wave after exit the slit it be illustrate in fig 1 and through the use of trigonometry the path difference be give by where be the path difference d be the slit separation and ✓ be the diffraction angle the superposition result in an interference pattern form because the wave be able to interfere with each other periodically such that a consistent pattern be produce the interference occurs constructively when the wave meet in phase meaning there be a phase difference between them of a multiple of 2⇡ where be the phase difference and m be the order number the wavenumber which be write a k be characteristic to a wave and be consider a the phase per unit distance a demonstrate by this equation where be the wavelength the fractional distance of the wavelength move in other word the phase difference relates to the path difference by the follow equation equate the result in equation 1 equation 2 and equation 4gives the follow relationship between the separation of slit and the wavelength b. energy level in quantum theory atom consist of neutron and proton in their central nucleus with electron in surround orbital shell quantum theory explains the characteristic behaviour of the electron because of the quantum mechanical system they can be consider to act in the atom be clearly stable because it can retain it initial state in most case provide that it be not radioactive the explanation for the model of the atom by classical mechanic be unstable because it allows the electron to have any energy whereas in quantum mechanic the electron can only have specific discrete value of energy the electron be a negatively charge particle and will experience an attractive force due to it interaction with the positively charge nucleus a coulomb 's law state the presence of a resultant force by newton 's second law mean it be also accelerate accord to the larmor formula 3 the electron will radiate power because it be both charge and accelerate this radiation represent an energy loss and in the classical model this electron would spiral into the nucleus a represent in fig 2 meaning that the whole atom itself appear to be unstable fig 2. the classical model to the left show an electron that loses energy collapse towards the nucleus this electron be particle like the quantum model to the right show a stable electron orbit the nucleus with fix energy this electron be wave like 4 the quantum model allows electron to have discrete quantity of energy a way in which this be possible be if the electron be to act a stand wave in each orbit the orbit have a circumference that be a multiple of the electron 's wavelength which mean the orbit can only occur at specific distance from the nucleus the electron can only exist in these discrete orbit therefore they can only transition between these particular position 5 these transition amount to a change in total energy because there be a change in both potential energy and kinetic energy there be two case one where an electron drop an energy level and another where it rise an energy level rise an energy level require a gain in energy this be ultimately because the potential energy be increase and the attraction to the nucleus must be overcome fig 3. the electron move from a discrete high energy level to a discrete low energy level therefore there be a discrete energy loss which occurs a electromagnetic radiation this electromagnetic radiation be present a a photon characterise by a specific wavelength and frequency drop an energy level amount to a decrease in energy and it be this case that be explore in this experiment the decrease in energy be represent by the emission of a photon a fig 3 illustrates the photon emit will have a discrete amount of energy because of the discrete orbitals these packet of energy be quantise by the follow equation where e be the energy of the photon h be planck 's constant and ⌫ be the frequency of the photon this can be rewrite a where c be the speed of light consider this energy be quantise there must be a some kind of relationship between the energy of emit photon and their orbital ring or in other word energy level this energy be a function of wavelength a equation 7 show and so this relationship can be express by the equation where be specifically the wavelength of the emit photon in a vacuum r 1 be the rydberg constant z be the atomic number n be the initial energy level of the electron and p be the final energy level of the electron in the case of hydrogen because it only have one the equation simplifies to the transition between the energy level have many combination so they be divide in to series which be characterise by the final energy level of the electron the balmer series be one that be define for when electron drop down to the second energy level other series such a the lyman and paschen be define by energy level of 1 and 3 respectively 6 the significance of the balmer series be that it be the only series that produce wavelength within the visible light spectrum therefore throughout the analysis of the hydrogen emission spectrum the only line that can be view directly by eye in the laboratory be from the balmer series the transition which give visible light only go up to the point where the electron begin at energy level 6. this be because the change in energy level becomes so large that the wavelength of the emit photon be too small to be observe the human eye can view electromagnetic wave with wavelength between 400 and 700 nm the wavelength emit on the visible spectrum correspond to different colour emission a picture in fig 4. the grate spectrometer be set up on a raise platform by be attach to a small table so that all observation could easily be take at eye level throughout the experiment it be make sure that the optical equipment be not touch so that the equipment be clean and light could travel a expect the camera lens of the telescope be focus onto an object that be around 5 to 10 meter away this be do in a well lit room to make the image easy for view the eyepiece lens be then focus onto the crosshair to reduce parallax between the image and the crosshair itself once this be do the experiment be move into a darken room the telescope be align directly with the axis of the collimator so that they be position in a straight line a sodium lamp be place behind the slit for the rest of the setup in order to protect the hydrogen lamp a prolong use of it could have cause it to overheat and become damage the light from the slit be view through the eyepiece and the focus of the collimator be adjust until slit light be focus on the crosshair the slit size be reduce to the point where it be more manageable to focus it the crosshair be also rotate to a cross position a oppose to a plus position to aid this focus process the main scale and vernier scale be use to record the exact position of the telescope the grate table be rotate through 90 degree with the slow motion drive aid this rotation to be a accurate a possible once it be clamped tightly into position a mirror be place in the holder fig 5. the light from the hydrogen lamp pas through the slit and a reduce segment of it be capture this fraction of light can be diffract by the slit but the ray of light be make parallel when they pa through the collimator these parallel beam be then diffract by the diffraction grate have met it surface perpendicularly these diffract light ray then enter the telescope and be magnify into the eyepiece by passing through the camera lens and eyepiece lens 8 the holder be rotate until a reflect image from the collimator be view from the eyepiece to ensure that the grate surface be at 45 degree to the incident ray the adjustment screw on the grate table be alter so that the table be horizontal and at a height where the image be align with the crosshair the angle of the grate table be record and rotate through by 45 degree use the table and slow motion drive so that it surface be perpendicular to the incident ray the mirror be replace for a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm the telescope be finally then move back through 90 o to it original position so it be in alignment with the slit collimator and grate at this original position the light be observe a be a maximum with a combination of colour that have not be diffract at all this be take to be the reference point for order 0 and it position be record a 183.5 o 5 ± 0.5 the spectral line be observe briefly by rotate the telescope the slit size be alter by decrease and increase it until the line could be view optimally start from the maximum order at 183.5 o 5 the positive direction be take to be clockwise in which the scale of the angle reading increase the order record from here be also take to be positive the telescope be slowly rotate around until the first order be locate the colour present be record position the crosshair on each spectral line meant the angle on the scale could be measure for each colour at order 1. this be repeat across the whole quadrant for the subsequent order until no more line could be observe at all the telescope be then take in the counterclockwise direction from the reference point and the same reading be record such that the angle on the scale be decrease and the order be consider to be negative three colour be observe throughout the experiment these be red aqua and blue which can also be name h-↵ h-and h-respectively in relation to their electron 's initial position for all of these wavelength there be a positive correlation present between the sine of the diffraction angle and the order associate with that angle the diffraction angle be calculate by subtract the reference angle of 183.5 o 5 from the record value on the scale each reading have an error of 0.5 arcminute so the error in the diffraction angle be simply calculate by add the error in quadrature for the subtraction this meant each diffraction angle have an error of 0.71 arcminute with respect to the sine of the angle this error can be consider negligible a show by the very small error in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8. this emphasis the precision the grate spectrometer can have when take measurement the graph be manipulate such that they pas through the origin because this be a specific value for the datasets and can be record a well a state without error because it occurs at the reference angle for this experiment the wavelength and their error be calculate by multiply the gradient and error by the grate period of 12.69 µm the grate period be take to have no error because it be custom make therefore the only error account for in this calculation result from the angle measurement the red wavelength be calculate a 656.1 ± 2.7 nm this be closely align with the accepted value of 656.3nm within experimental uncertainty the aqua wavelength be calculate a 490.8 ± 3.4 nm 486.1 nm be the accepted value and the calculate value do n't agree with this experimentally but this be only a slight difference the blue wavelength be calculate a 439.8 ± 6.0 nm this wavelength coincides with the accepted one of 434.0 nm within the experimental error obtain the position of the lamp be found to have no affect on the position of the line because the slit still accepts a fraction of the light it be found however that the lamp position affected the intensity of the light with a reduction if it be far away therefore if it be n't a close a possible to the slit the line at great order may not have be visible a likely cause for an error in the wavelength be the calibration of the spectrometer the fact that the anticlockwise direction have more observable order suggests the diffraction pattern be n't symmetric about our reference point this mean the calibration of the instrument ca n't have be correct and the light may have hit the grate surface at an angle that be n't the normal this be highlight by the modulus value of the diffraction angle for each order in table i the symmetry appear to get bad a the wavelength decrease fig 6. a linear relationship be show between the sine of the diffraction angle and the order this red photon give the steepest gradient out of the three photon with a value of 0.05170 ± 0.00021 and this corresponds to how the absolute value of the error for the wavelength also increase a wavelength decrease to improve in this case a great grate period could be use a although less order would be present the same number should still be record-able the pattern would also be more symmetric because the angle of each order would be much more similar a far extension of this would have be to check the symmetry before take measurement by verify if it be calibrate correctly the air pressure humidity and temperature affect the record of the wavelength in a systematic way because when the each of these value increase the air in the room becomes less vacuum like the increase in pressure mean the pressure be n't exactly that of a vacuum increase in the number of water molecule in the air mean that the area be n't a deplete of matter so the air be less of a vacuum furthermore by the gay-lussac law the great temperature result in the pressure be great too such that it be less vacuum like 9 all of this mean the refractive index be great than that of a perfect vacuum so the speed of the light be less result in a reduce wavelength in this case the wavelength be n't less but actually slightly great therefore this must n't be a significant contributor to the variation of wavelength to their accepted value a likely systematic error would be that of the grate period it may not be exactly a state but actual more therefore the wavelength be calculate a be great than they should be in addition to this the separation may not be perfectly uniform and so wavelength would of course appear to be slightly different this would require a test of the diffraction grate value use a know wavelength for a monochromatic light by the same method a this experiment the calculate wavelength for each photon emission be related to their respective emission level use the balmer series it be evident that the red photon occur by an electron drop from a low energy level than the others equation 7 show this a it 's clear a large wavelength cause a small energy change therefore it could be conclude that the respective energy level state be 3 for h-↵ 4 for h-fig 8. this linear relationship have the shallowest gradient of the three photon of 0.03466 ± 0.00047 because it have the great energy and therefore the small wavelength and 5 for h- the reciprocal of the wavelength be plot against the change in the reciprocal of the square of the energy level to give a straight line in fig 9. the covariance matrix for this plot could not be calculate because there be only three point however the line clearly illustrates the linear relationship present where the gradient be the negative of the rydberg constant a predict by equation 8. the rydberg constant be calculate by consider each of the three value of the constant from the three wavelength a independent value that can form a normal distribution with a mean and standard error use equation 9. the rydberg value be found to have an average of 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 this meant the rydberg constant calculate can be state a 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 the value deduce for the rydberg constant do not agree with the accepted value of 10 973 731.6 m 1 this be only ever so slightly a the percentage difference be 0.77 this would suggest that the experiment be very accurate a it only differs from the accepted value slightly however within experimental uncertainty it be do n't therefore there be likely to be a small systematic error this error would have occur in the measurement take for the wavelength if the fourth colour be observe the experiment would have be well a the precision would be great because fig 9. there be a linear trend between the change in the reciprocal of the energy level square the slope be define a the negative of the rydberg constant the dash line be that of the actual constant and the solid one be the experimental one so it be evident there be a systematic error because the experimental value be shallower and therefore less than the accepted value the error be less and the linear relationship would have be verify more strongly the fact that there be only four point that be visible be still very little therefore a way in which the experiment can be improve to allow for more data point in the final plot be to record wavelength that be n't visible a method for this would be to use a uv-meter this would allow not only the uv-light in the balmer series to be detect but the uv-light in the lyman series the rydberg constant be deduce a 10 890 000 ± 40 000 m 1 this be a very precise result with a small percentage error of 0.40 it only deviate from the accepted value by 0.77 and this be most likely due to a small systematic error it be show that the grate spectrometer be effective in study the spectrum of light the proportional relationship between the sine of diffraction angle and their order be consistently verify this allow precise and accurate wavelength of h-↵ h-and h-to be calculate a 656.1 ± 2.7 nm 490.8 ± 3.4 nm and 439.8 ± 6.0 nm respectively a clear success for this experiment be the use of the spectrometer because record be take efficiently and precisely with the main and vernier scale despite this successful usage the setup could definitely be improve with well calibration to ensure that the pattern be symmetric about order 0. furthermore extra investigation could be carry out to estimate the magnitude of the potential systematic error an adaptation to the experiment would involve increase the number of wavelength obtain so that the experiment have less spread the use of a uv-meter would enable more line to be record the repetition of the experiment in a glass chamber would ensure the area be a close to a vacuum a possible allow great accuracy for the wavelength value the grate spectrometer be a sufficient device for deduce the rydberg constant and it be effective in produce precise result the combination of many theory like quantum and wave-particle duality result in the rydberg constant meaning it be a vital constant in explain the model of

32,GS_KUY555_Redacted,in this experiment we attempt to determine the rydberg constant by direct measurement of the wavelength of photon emit from the de-excitation of hydrogen atom in the balmer series use a spectrometer with diffraction grate of line density n 300mm −1 grate 1 and n 78.8mm −1 grate 2 we then use the rydberg equation to make an estimate of the rydberg constant from the gradient and y-intercept of the plot we estimate the rydberg constant within a tolerance of 2.7 or less use grate 1 we calculate r∞ 1.11 ± 0.03 × 10 7 m −1 and r∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the

the emission or absorption spectrum of a light source or gaseous atom spectrometer typically offer measurement to an accuracy of ±1 or 1 arc-minute 1 when propagate through this be equivalent to an error in the wavelength of approximately σ λ 0.03 give sufficient repeat measurement be make 2 make it one of the most accurate experimental equipment available a spectrometer be usually configure along with a refractive prism or a diffraction grate by use the prism it be possible to analyse the amount of refraction undergone by each incident wavelength of light and therefore determine the refractive index of the prism a a function of wavelength 3 by use a diffraction grate it be possible to use the diffraction angle to determine the wavelength of the incident light in our experiment we will be use the latter technique to analyse the emission spectrum of a hydrogen lamp the grate spectrometer have a range of application for example the grate spectrometer be use by fraunhofer in 1814 to see the 574 dark line of the solar absorption spectrum 4 which be subsequently use to determine the atomic composition of the sun similarly the light from distant star have be analyse by highly sensitive grate spectrometer and this have be use to determine their atomic composition which subsequently allows astrophysicist to infer the temperature and age of these star spectrometry can also be use with gas chromatography in forensics to analyse the composition of a sample of material a discus by knight the ratio of the intensity of these spectral line be related to the temperature of the gaseous sample while the width of the line be related to the density of the gas 2 give vital clue for analysis of the sample this technique can be use to confirm the presence of certain atom for example in a drug sample or can be use to verify the purity of water 5 the rydberg constant be fundamental to physic and be related to a number of physical quantity primarily the rydberg constant be the constant of proportionality in the rydberg equation which relates the wavelength of light emit by excite electron when they transition between the energy level of a hydrogen atom the value of the rydberg constant denote r ∞ be approximately 6 r ∞ 1.09737 × 10 7 m −1 however the rydberg constant also have other application for example it can be define in term of the fine structure constant α 7.29735 × 10 −3 which be a dimensionless quantity that characterises the ratio of the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two electron to the strength of the gravitational interaction between two planck mass 7 then the rydberg constant can be express a where a 0 5.29177 × 10 −11 m be the bohr radius the wavelength of light need to ionise a hydrogen atom be λ 9.12 × 10 −8 m and can be calculate by equate eq 1 to 1/λ from the planck-einstein relation the ionisation energy of the hydrogen atom be then e 2.176 × 10 −18 j. the rydberg constant be also related to the compton wavelength of an electron λ e by therefore the compton wavelength of an electron be λ e 2.426 × 10 −12 m. note that the relationship of the rydberg constant to other physical constant provide an indirect method of determine these constant for example if we be able to determine the rydberg constant through a grate spectrometer experiment then we be subsequently able to determine other related quantity such a the fine structure constant the bohr radius or the compton wavelength of an electron which can then be use to determine planck 's constant or the mass of an electron the ability to measure the rydberg constant accurately also limit the error in these related quantity that may be more difficult to measure experimentally spectrometry be the process of analyse the emission spectrum of a light source or the absorption spectrum of a sample material to understand the principle of spectroscopy the bohr model of the atom be use where electron exist only in discrete energy level which be unique to each atom therefore the energy level transition -that be the energy need for an electron to transition from a low energy state to high energy state -are generally unique for each atom when an atom de-excites it electron transition from a high energy state to a low energy state release energy a photon the energy release from each de-excitation event be equal to the energy difference between the initial energy state and the final energy state a these energy difference be discrete and unique for each atom the energy of the photon emit and hence the wavelength of the photon emit be also discrete and unique for each atom when an atom be excite by heating it electron move to high energy level but be unstable in these energy level and will spontaneously de-excite emit photon of discrete wavelength if these emit photon be analyse they will produce an emission spectrum conversely if an atom in it ground state be expose to white light contain photon with energy that coincide with the transition energy of the atom the ground state electron will absorb these photon and transition to the high energy level this will produce absorption spectrum of dark line where certain wavelength of white light be absorbed by the electron of gaseous atom in this experiment we will consider the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom hydrogen have a number of spectral series for example the lyman series be the set of spectral line when excite electron from energy level n 2 3 4 de-excite to the ground state we will focus on the balmer series which refers to the spectral line emission when electron in energy level n 3 4 5 de-excite to the second energy level this be because the balmer series be the only spectral series for hydrogen that result in the emission of line in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum the define equation for this behaviour be the rydberg equation where λ be the wavelength of the photon emit when an electron de-excites from the nth energy level to the pth energy level p n a before r ∞ be the rydberg constant p 2 for the balmer series and n 3 4 5 then the value of λ for different value of n be give in table i. the diffraction grate of the grate spectrometer behaves accord to the principle of diffraction and interference diffraction occurs when a wavefront encounter an obstruction the balmer series -these be the wavelength of photon emit when an electron in a hydrogen atom deexcites from the nth energy level to the second energy level note that n could take any value up to ∞ but these value of n be the only one that produce photon in the visible spectrum which range from 400-700nm 8 in it path such a an aperture or an obstacle 1 this cause the wavefront to curve around the obstruction which creates a path difference between different ray and therefore cause interference produce an intensity pattern that depends on the geometry of the setup when the number of slit be increase the intensity pattern becomes more complicate and be show for n 2 10 slit in fig 1. fig 1 plot show the intensity pattern produce by diffraction through n slit for a fix slit width and slit separation solid line note that each of the intensity pattern be modulate by the intensity pattern of single slit diffraction dash line since each slit have a finite width and therefore light also undergoes single slit diffraction through these slit the equation for the intensity pattern produce by a wave of wavelength λ diffract through a diffraction grate of line density n be 9 in this experiment we aim to use a grate spectrometer to make an estimate of the rydberg constant firstly we will use the grate spectrometer to measure the diffraction angle and hence the wavelength of light emit by a light source contain gaseous hydrogen atom we will compare these wavelength to those suggest by the rydberg equation accord to the balmer series allow u to make an estimate of the rydberg constant we can now use our derive equation to make prediction about the experiment firstly from the rydberg equation eq 2 we predict that we will observe principle maximum correspond to the wavelength and colour specify in table i. it be possible that the maximum correspond to λ 410nm will not be visible a it be almost outside of the visible light spectrum nevertheless we should be able to make measurement of at least three of the wavelength in table i. we can make the measurement of the wavelength λ by record the order m of the maximum observe and the diffraction angle θ at which the maximum occurs use the spectrometer then with sufficient repeat measurement we plot the graph of sin θ against m correspond to the relation give in eq 4. hence the slope of this plot should be and therefore we can determine the wavelength λ. once we have record the wavelength for correspond value of n from table i we then use the relationship in eq 2 to plot a graph of 1/λ against 1/n 2 this plot should have slope give by s −r ∞ 6 and y-intercept since p 2 for the balmer series we can determine the rydberg constant from these relationship we use a grate spectrometer with an engrave vernier scale on a rotate diffraction table the spectrometer include a collimator with a slit which ensures that the incident ray be parallel and an eyepiece which allows the intensity pattern to be observe a the light source we use a hydrogen lamp which excites gaseous hydrogen atom by passing a current through the gas the emit light be a mixture of wavelength but we will only be able to observe the visible photon with wavelength a specify in table i. we also have diffraction grate of slit density n 78.8mm −1 and n 300mm −1 provide to u fig 2 show the set-up of the apparatus a view from above fig 2 a plan view of the apparatus use to measure the wavelength of light emit by de-excitation of hydrogen atom the light emit by a hydrogen lamp be collimate before be diffract through the diffraction grate the rotate eyepiece can then be use to record the order m and the angle θ m of the spectral line first we configure the eyepiece by adjust the focus until it produce a clear pattern of the crosshairs we also rotate the crosshairs until they form an × instead of a this make it easy to find the centre of the spectral line see fig 7 in appendix b to complete the experiment successfully it be crucial that the light from the hydrogen lamp be perpendicular to the diffraction grate to prevent oblique incidence pattern which complicates the analysis 10 to do this we first lock the diffraction table and align the eyepiece parallel to the collimator while ensure no diffraction grate be use a source of light e.g desk lamp be use to illuminate the slit cover the opening of the collimator the slit be then close until the central line be view a a clear vertical line from the eyepiece if the line be not vertical the angle of the slit be adjust until this requirement be met once the crosshairs be centre on the line of light from the desk lamp the eyepiece be fix in position and an initial reading of the angle be take from the vernier scale on the diffraction table from this reading we subtract 90 • and then rotate the eyepiece to the calculate angle this ensures that the eyepiece be exactly perpendicular to the collimator from this angle we lock the eyepiece and unlock the diffraction table we place a reflective mirror in the slit holder and rotate the diffraction table until the reflect light from the desk lamp be incident on the centre of the crosshairs in the eyepiece this ensures that the grate holder be now position at an angle of 45 • to the collimator we take a note of this reading and add 45 • before rotate the diffraction table until it be at the require angle now the diffraction holder be align perpendicular to the ray from the collimator for the remainder of the experiment the diffraction table will remain lock in this position this alignment procedure be show in fig 3. fig 3 calibrate the spectrometer -it be essential that the spectrometer be align such that the incidence ray be perpendicular to the diffraction grate in order to prevent the effect of oblique incidence 10 initially we use grate 1 a this will produce a wider intensity pattern and will therefore have a small percentage error in the diffraction angle measurement we turn off external source of light and position a hydrogen lamp close to the slit of the collimator then we place the diffraction grate into the grate holder and rotate the eyepiece until the crosshairs be centre on the central fringe for each colour of spectral line visible we record the angle of the spectral line for each order up to the maximum visible order afterwards we repeat the experiment use the 2nd grate to give u additional measurement of the wavelength in the balmer series a expect the fourth spectral line correspond to the wavelength λ 410nm be too dark to measure accurately therefore the final data consist of only three visible spectral line the complete dataset be include in appendix c for your inspection to be able to plot the data we have collect we first convert each angle from arc-minutes to it radian equivalent use the formula where α be the degree element of the angle and d be the arcminute element subsequently we normalise the angle of each colour by subtract the average of the m 0 order maximum from each of the measure angle thereby ensure that the central fringe occurs at θ 0rad plot each of the value of sin θ for normalise θ against order of maximum m produce a linear graph for each of the visible wavelength of the balmer series a show in fig 4. from the plot in fig 4 we can deduce the wavelength of each of the spectral line use eq 4. these result be summarise in table ii now for each of the value of n and calculate λ we plot 1/λ against 1/n 2 accord to the relationship specify in eq 2. these plot be show in fig 5. from these graph we calculate the rydberg constant a summarise in table iii the error calculation in table ii and table iii have be adjust to account for the uncertainty due to the resolution of an instrument a well a the systematic error discus below for example the vernier scale offer an accuracy of up to ±1 or ±0.0167 • but the actual uncertainty in each measurement of the angle be great this be primarily because fig 4 a plot of sin θ against m for both diffraction grate note that the red light have the steepest gradient a it have the long wavelength which confirms the relationship in eq 5. with the 1st grate the maximum be spread far apart but their intensity reduces with θ so only the first three order of maximum be visible for the 2nd grate the percentage error in each measurement of the angle be great than with the denser grate but more maximum be visible with this grate and therefore the overall error in the wavelength be low of a significant parallax error when reading the vernier scale which give error up to ±3 depend on the angle the scale be be read from to minimise this we try to read the scale from directly above additionally the dark condition in the room meant that it be difficult for our eye to determine the exact point at which the engrave of the vernier scale line up sometimes lead to disagreement in the reading of up to ±6 furthermore there would be an error associate with the measurement of the angle of the central fringe which be propagate through each reading when the angle be normalise this central fringe angle be calculate from an average of three reading and therefore be likely to have a small error of around ±0.5 another source of error related to the alignment of the grate be in relation to the use of a mirror the mirror reflect light upon incidence with it surface but a diffraction grate diffracts light after it pas through the surface if we assume that the thickness of the mirror be approximately 2mm this would cause a shift in the reflection by up to fig 5 a plot of the inverse wavelength 1/λ against 1/n 2 where n be the quantum number of the energy level in the balmer series a specify in table i for the n 300mm −1 grate φ 64 see fig 6 which would impact the alignment throughout the experiment this error could be minimise by use a thinner mirror use a spectrometer which have a large distance between the diffraction grate and the eyepiece or hold the mirror on the outer side of the grate holder so that the thickness of the mirror can be neglect the systematic error due to the thickness of the mirror can not be measure by experiment since all of the measure value be affected by this systematic error and be therefore consistent however note that the misalignment of the diffraction grate cause all of the spectral line to shift by φ but this should not impact the relative angle between order and therefore should not be account for in the error calculation above accounting for these factor the uncertainty in our measurement of the angle be more than the resolution of the vernier scale it be reasonable to assume that this error be likely to be approximately ±6 which be what have be use for the measurement in table ii a minor source of error be in the value of the line density of each grate we be told that the line density be n 300mm −1 and n 80mm −1 nominally and these be often accurately produce with error approximately σ n ±0.001mm −1 however the diffraction grate be use and have scratch surface which would diminish their ability to diffract light therefore a conservative estimate of fig 6 a possibility of an error arise in the alignment of the spectrometer due to a finite thickness of the mirror the error in these diffraction grate be 0.1 these error have also be account for in the error calculation in table ii lastly we consider the error contribution due to external source or change condition for example heating of the hydrogen lamp may cause it to emit additional wavelength of light if the tube be not adequately evacuate in our experiment we observe an unexpected yellow spectral line while take measurement while we could not determine the source of the yellow spectral line we decide to ignore it a erroneous and focus primarily on those colour we have predict in our theory but this introduces the possibility that there be other erroneous spectral line in our data to prevent change temperature condition from affect our result we take the precaution of measure the result alternately -that be first red line then violet line then blue line -to ensure there be no immediate pattern in term of the wavelength of the light that could have be impact by the change external condition the final table of error contribution in the value of the rydberg constant be show in table iv the error in the rydberg constant be mostly due to the error in the diffraction angle of σ θ ±6 which subsequently impact upon the error in the wavelength of light from the balmer series however this error be reduce by take repeat reading in use the spectrometer we be able to accurately determine the angle of diffraction for different wavelength by measure the angle at which their spectral line form on an emission spectrum the spectrometer offer an accuracy of ±1 but we be unable to take advantage of this accuracy due to systematic inaccuracy e.g parallax error however we be able to collect a significant amount of data in order to reduce the effect of random error for each wavelength and each order we take up to three measurement and be able to take the average of these to a good degree of accuracy this be a strength of the experiment -the ability to reproduce the same result with consistency and very small fluctuation due to random error a limitation of this experiment be that it rely on the balmer series because it be the only series that produce visible light for the hydrogen atom in the balmer series we be only able to observe 3 of the possible 4 visible wavelength of light which meant that while our error in the wavelength could be reduce by do repeat measurement the error in the rydberg constant be great owe to the fact that we only have three data point for the rydberg plot this be the reason for repeat the experiment with the n 78.8mm −1 grate to provide additional data point for the rydberg plot however a more effective technique would have enable u to measure the wavelength of light from the ultraviolet spectrum e.g by use a uv image camera provide additional data point to more accurately determine the rydberg constant a weakness of this method of determine the rydberg constant be that it assumes the bohr model perfectly describes energy level transition for atom however the bohr model be not completely accurate a it do not account for the effect of fine structure 11 -which concern relativity on an atomic level and electron spin -and hyperfine splitting 12 which take into consideration the existence of electron cloud rather than energy level a a result of these effect the rydberg constant be often not measure directly from observation of the spectral line instead emission spectrum of hydrogen and deuterium be use before make adjustment for the fine structure hyperfine splitting and a finite nuclear mass a more accurate method would account for these effect in summary we use the balmer series of hydrogen to calculate the wavelength of photon emit when electron transition from energy level n 3 4 5 to p 2 use a spectrometer and grate of line density n 300mm −1 and n 78.8mm −1 with eq 4. we then plot our calculate wavelength accord to the relationship in eq 2 and calculate the rydberg constant from both the gradient and the y-intercept quantity use eq 6 and eq 7. use the n 300mm −1 grate we calculate r ∞ 1.11 ± 0.03 × 10 7 m −1 and r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and y-intercept respectively for the n 78.8mm −1 grate we have r ∞ 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 and r ∞ 1.09 ± 0.01 × 10 7 m −1 from the gradient and y-intercept respectively the intensity pattern of the single slit envelope be govern by the expression sin 2 α α 2 while the principle maximum of the multiple slit intensity pattern be give by the equation accord to weisstein 13 the latter expression can be rewrite a appendix c final data this be the final dataset for this experiment spectral line that could not be see or distinguish be omit,prediction,exp,,,
33,GS_VEJ488_Redacted,an experiment have be carry out to measure the rydberg constant by use of a spectrometer with a diffraction grate the rydberg constant r∞ which relates the wavelength of photon in the balmer series emit by hydrogen to energy level transition in hydrogen have be measure to be r∞ 1.10 × 10 7 ± 1 × 10 5 m −1 which be in agreement with the accepted value 1 this be do by measure the diffraction angle of light of the emission line spectrum of a hydrogen lamp through a diffraction grate and from this deduce the correspond wavelength of the emit light these wavelength be use with the rydberg formula for hydrogen to determine a value of the rydberg constant when a hydrogen atom transition from one energy level to a low energy level a photon be emit with energy correspond to the difference of those two energy level since there be discrete energy level the photon energy can only take discrete value by extension the photon wavelength can also only take certain discrete value a the wavelength of light be inversely proportional to it energy the relation between wavelength and energy level be discus in section 2 and the relation include a constant of proportionality r ∞ the rydberg constant this relation be of importance a hydrogen be abundant in the universe the emission spectrum of which provide insight in many area such a astronomy this experiment determines the rydberg constant by measure the wavelength of some of the spectral emission line of different energy level transition this be do by use of a spectrometer which pas the light from a hydrogen lamp through a diffraction grate separate the light of different wavelength across multiple diffraction fringe at angle to the normal of the grate by measure the angle of these fringe to the normal the correspond wavelength can be determine and subsequently the rydberg constant can also be determine the use of a spectrometer allows for a high degree of precision a it allows the angle of diffraction of light from the source to be measure to the order of arc-minutes the wavelength of a photon emit by a hydrogen atom be give by the rydberg formula 2 where λ be the wavelength of the photon emit r ∞ be the rydberg constant and p and n be principle quantum number which take integer value for the energy level that the atom transition to and from respectively for the spectrum of wavelength in the visible light spectrum know a the balmer series p 2 and n ≥ 3. therefore a graph of for n correspond to λ will exhibit a relation of direct proportionality with gradient equal to the rydberg constant r ∞ r ∞ can also be express a a product of other fundamental physical constant 2 where c be the speed of light in vacuum m e be the mass of the electron α be the fine structure constant and h be the planck constant use the measure value of these constant 1 we obtain a value of r ∞ to which the result obtain in this experiment may be compare of r ∞ 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 see section 7 the spectrometer

which the light be diffract λ be the wavelength of the light and m be the number of the fringe of diffract light from the centre the central fringe at θ 0 be m 0 and the first fringe from the centre correspond to m ±1 this can be see from figure 1 maximum point of constructive interference occur in the diffraction pattern when the path difference of light through neighbour slit d sin θ be equal to an integer multiple m of the wavelength λ give by mλ this allows the wavelength of light in a spectral line to be determine from the angle through which the light have be diffract reading the condition of the experiment and environment be kept a constant a possible the reading of the angle through which the fringe be diffract allow the wavelength of the spectral line of the three different measure colour to be determine the table of these reading be give in section 7. the error on each reading be due mostly to the spread of each fringe each fringe span 0.5 • vary for each fringe and due to uncertainty on the reading of the vernier scale the effect of air pressure temperature humidity etc have be neglect in correction on these result and a such have also be estimate and account for in the error on each reading graph of m against sin θ for each of the measure wavelength be give in figure 4. these graph suggest a direct proportionality relationship a be predict by equation 3 equation 3 predicts that the gradient of the line for each colour wavelength be give by gradient λ d where d be the distance between adjacent slit in the diffraction grate the inverse of the number of slit per metre therefore the product of the gradient of these line with the value of d 1 788003 m the manufacturer of the diffraction grate specifies approximately 78.8 line per millimetre with negligible error relative to other error in this experiment allow the first three emission wavelength of the balmer series to be calculate these wavelength be a follow be give in table 1 table 1 measure balmer series wavelength n λ n 3 650 × 10 −9 ± 10 × 10 −9 m 4 481 × 10 −9 ± 5 × 10 −9 m 5 342 × 10 −9 ± 7 × 10 −9 m equation 1 predicts that the gradient of the graph of λ against n be give in figure 5 the gradient of this line be 1.10 × 10 7 ± 1 × 10 5 m −1 and therefore the result be that the rydberg constant have be measure to be the error on this result could be low significantly with the spectrometer experimental set-up in particular this experiment take no repeat reading due to time constraint but do so would reduce the error similarly take reading to high value of m and take reading for more than three of the wavelength in the spectrum would reduce the error significantly the error on each angle reading could be reduce far if the focus of the spectrometer be improve and the slit narrow make each fringe narrower this experiment set out measure the rydberg constant which relates the wavelength of photon emit by hydrogen to the transition in energy level of the hydrogen atom in emit these photon it do so by use of a spectrometer and diffraction grate measure the diffraction angle of the spectral line from a hydrogen lamp the value obtain for the rydberg constant be r ∞ 1.10 × 10 7 ± 1 × 10 5 m −1 which be in agreement with the theoretical calculation of the constant from other fundamental physical constant the error on this result be relatively high and the spectrometer

34,GS_OXY643_Redacted,he rydberg constant be one of the most important constant of atomic physic because of it connection with the fundamental atomic constant e h me c and because of the high accuracy with which it can be determine 1 the aim of this experiment be to produce a measurement for the rydberg constant use a pasco precision spectrometer this involve diffract light from a hydrogen discharge lamp connect to a power supply through a diffract grate the light produce by the lamp consists of photon with quantize wavelength correspond to the difference in the energy between the initial and final energy state of the atom the diffraction grate with a fix grate space cause these wavelength to spread out at angle with wavelength dependence to produce emission line spectrum which be visible through a telescope this set up enable u to determine the quantize wavelength from which we could then determine the rydberg constant the constant appear most notably in the bohr model of the atom to put it simply niels bohr postulate that the energy of an atom can take only certain value for which he won the nobel prize in 1922. when a photon of a particular energy be eject from an atom he found that the energy of the atom decrease by the same amount he reason that this be an atom make a transition to a low energy level with the energy of the photon equate the energy difference in the internal energy state of the initial and final state from the emission line spectrum he be able to deduce that many different wavelength be emit which correspond to the different transition between energy level in an atom and that the wavelength produce be unique to different element these transition be best described by electron transfer from a specific stable energy orbit about the nucleus of an atom to a low one because the same element produce the same emission line he be able to also determine that it be not possible for there to exist an atom in an energy state that be intermediate to two adjacent energy level the constant appear in the rydberg formula which calculates the theoretical wavelength that will be emit by an atom when it transition to a low energy level the hydrogen wavelength in the bohr model be give by where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the emit photon s 𝑛 be the initial energy state of the atom 𝑝 be the final energy state of the atom and 𝑅 `` be the

be know by observation we can determine the initial energy state the atom be in prior to the emission of the photon for 2. because the centre of the fringe be judged by the person look through the telescope there be an error in the angle of the angular width of the fringe the gradient of this linear graph be 5.18e-2m ± 0.06e-4m where the error in the gradient be obtain from the covariance

obtain the follow linear fit the linear fit in fig 5 have gradient 3.92e-2m ± 0.06e-2m where the error in the gradient be calculate use the covariance matrix in jupyter notebook the error in the ydirection corresponds to the value in the fourth column of table 3 which be the error in the value of the angular displacement of the emission line from the central maximum use 3 we calculate the wavelength of blue light to be 497nm ± 7nm the blue emission line of the blamer spectrum of hydrogen be produce when hydrogen atom transition from the 4 th energy state to the 2 nd energy state by substitute 𝑛=4 and the measure value of wavelength into 1 the rydberg constant be measure to be 10.7e+6m ± 0.1e+6m where the percentage error in the rydberg constant be equal to the percentage error

have not be consider it be determine that the function use to calculate the error on the gradient of the graph be incorrect in it error analysis and the correct error be calculate manually this turn out to be the importance of be able to measure the rydberg constant accurately be establish due to the work of three physicist johan balmer johannes rydberg and niels bohr the balmer formula be discover empirically by johann balmer when measure the spectrum of hydrogen with an incorporate empirical constant rydberg stumble upon the balmer formula for the hydrogen spectrum and realise that it agree with his own formula relate the wavelength of the spectrum of various chemical the rydberg constant first arose when rydberg recast balmer 's formula and he measure the constant a 109 721.6 cm

be quite large for most of the value with a very small error on the reading for the 0 th order this limit the error on the gradient despite the large error for the other reading the discrepancy between the error for each measure order should be negligible since the method use for each reading be identical this indicates that the amount of reading take be insufficient to stabilize the magnitude of the random error theoretically twelve value must be take to minimize the error to ± 0.2 nm see ref 3 suggest the two set of data collect be insufficient the initial error calculation use the built in `` linregress `` function in python 3.6 which do not account for the error bar on each reading but instead calculates the error of the regression fit by calculate the average random error on a reading and add it in quadrature with the error on the gradient the error remains at ± 1 × 10 5 m to one significant figure to comment far on the result more reading must be take less order be visible for the purple line when compare to the red and blue line with the 2 nd order beam be extremely faint this could also be a source of error which be n't account for the value of r∞ obtain by use the wavelength calculate by the blue light be 1.109 × 10 7 ± 3 × 10 4 m -1 the wavelength of the light that be calculate and use to find 𝑅 ∞ be 4.81 × 10 -9 ± 1 × 10 -9 m give by the follow graph the value of the gradient be 0.144 to three significant figure with the same percentage error a the wavelength because the error on the gradient only come from d and λ. the error on d be unknown so the error on λ only come from the error on the gradient the same correction to the calculate error for the wavelength of the blue light must be consider due to the inconsistency of the error bar which lead to an improve error of ± 5 × 10 4 m -1 for r∞ for the red light a value of r∞ record be 1.129× 10 7 ± 8 × 10 4 m -1 with the wavelength be record a 6.38 × 10 -7 ± 8 × 10 4 m take from the follow graph the error on fig 5 seem to be more consistent with two error stand out a anomalous they can not be rule out however due to the amount of record data set be too low the correct error on the value of r∞ be 9 × 10 4 only slightly high than the previous error combine all the datasets to find the average value of the rydberg constant across all of the wavelength in the balmer spectrum give a value of 1.112 × 10 7 ± 1.3 × 10 5 m -1 there be a 0.99 error but the percentage difference be 1.34 it be this discrepancy that motivate far error analysis to see where the error be be underestimated which be found to be the lack of incorporation of the error bar in the python function use a state previously correct this an error of ± 140,000 to two significant figure lead to a percentage error of 1.26 this be still low than expect but this discrepancy be likely due to the lack of far repeat data set another source of error which may contribute to the discrepancy be the accidental adjustment of the apparatus which could have misalign the collimator grate or the vernier scale the width of the spectral line depend on the width of the slit and focus of the collimator this be adjust until the line be a thin a possible without become difficult to view in the eyepiece there be a random error when align the telescope on the rotational axis because the cross hair may lie on a slightly different position with each measure spectral line estimation must be use to far increase the accuracy of the random error on r∞ the error on the thickness of the spectral line can be approximate to ± 15 arcminute since the width of the spectral line be about 30 arcminute the error on the misalignment of the spectrometer be estimate to be ± 5 arcminute incorporate this into the error on the final value of r∞ give an error of ± 1.6 × 10 5 m -1 which give a percentage error of 1.42 which encompasses the actual value grate spectroscopy a a method be able to calculate a very precise value of the rydberg constant even though bohr 's theory of the atom which be assume in section ii do n't give a full explanation of the energy level of all atom it do give a very accurate prediction for the energy level of a hydrogen atom the high precision of the method use suggests the error and lack of far precision be not due to the method but due to other factor the vernier scale use be also very

36,GS_SCO219_Redacted,an investigation be carry out use grate spectrometry and balmer line from a hydrogen lamp to determine the value of rydberg 's constant use rydberg 's formula equation 1 know value for energy level and measure value for the wavelength of the emission line a value for r be obtain the value and associate error for r obtain be 1.083 × 10 7 ± 3.562 × 10 3 m −1 ±0.0329 although the error for r be apparently low because of the high precision of the spectrometer use compare this to the accepted value of r 1.097×10 7 m −1 4 it be note that the accepted value do not lie within the error bound of our calculate result this be likely to due the poor alignment of the grate and the potentially incorrect value for d. before johannes rydberg have developed his famous equation johann balmer investigate spectral line from hydrogen and deduce his equation which be applicable to energy state transition to the n=2 state it be only on the 5 th of november 1888 that johannes rydberg have generalise balmer 's equation so that it be applicable to any energy state transition in a hydrogen atom and therefore any hydrogen-like atom where λ be the wavelength of the light emit r be the rydberg constant and n 1 and n 2 be the initial and final energy level respectively the rydberg equation give u a very accurate way of calculate the wavelength of the photon release when an electron in a hydrogen atom de-excites to a low energy level exploration of hydrogen emission line have proven to be very important in the development of modern physic consider the fact hydrogen make up 75 of the element in our universe moreover the development of the rydberg equation lead to bohr 's model of the atom and the quantum revolution in this investigation the balmer line will be explore this be because some of the balmer line have wavelength which lie in the visible region whereas lyman line n 2 1 and paschen line n 2 3 have wavelength which lie in the infra-red and ultra-violet region respectively a diffraction grate spectrometer will be use to analyse the spectral line to obtain the constituent wavelength of light from a hydrogen lamp use these wavelength and rydberg 's formula equation 1 we can deduce an experimental value for r. when a hydrogen lamp be connect to a power source and turn on light of specific wavelength be emit a the high-energy electron pa through the hydrogen gas they interact with the hydrogen atom and cause them to excite once the electron in the hydrogen shell be in the high energy state it then naturally de-excites to a low energy state release a photon in the process the energy of the photon release upon de-excitation be equal to the energy change of the electron across the two energy state the equation that relates the energy level change in hydrogen to the wavelength of light release be call the rydberg equation -see equation 1. sometimes the rydberg constant be write a r ∞ where the '∞ indicates that we be assume that the mass of the electron be negligible compare to that of the hydrogen nucleus 3 the rydberg constant itself can also be express a a series of constant a publish by bohr in 1913 -see equation 2. m e e 4 8e 2 0 h 3 c 2 balmer line occur when the electron in hydrogen fall from high energy level to the second energy level therefore in the case for balmer line n 2 2. see figure 1 4 for a visual representation of the process since the photon release be in the visible part of the electromagnetic em spectrum one would be able to see the light from a hydrogen lamp with the naked eye it be indeed the case that at least three of the balmer emission line be visible to the human eye through a grate spectrometer when light pas through the diffraction grate in the grate spectrometer it get split into it constituent colour this because successive maximum and minimum occur for each wavelength of light a constructive and destructive interference occurs it can be easily deduce 1 that for a diffraction grate with slit separation d and light of wavelength λ the fringe space θ be give by equation 3 3 experimental method the observation of the balmer spectral line be carry out use a grate spectrometer 2 the eyepiece lens be adjust by adjust the focus while observe a distant image the collimator lens be a adjust so that a sharp image of the central maximum be observe through the eyepiece lens the adjustment of the collimator ensure that the light travel through the collimator a a parallel beam after calibration no adjustment be make to the lens for the remainder of the experiment the hydrogen lamp be place directly in front of the spectrometer slit in order that a much light pas through the slit a possible to give emission line that be a prominent a possible the diffraction grate of 78.8 slit per millimetre be place in the centre of the spectrometer the slit width be increase to allow more light through to locate the approximate position of the fringe the slit be then narrow so that it be a small a possible while still allow enough light through so that the spectral line be visible to reduce the uncertainty for the measurement the slit width be not adjust for the remainder of the experiment to measure the position of the fringe θ for each wavelength the cross-hair on the eyepiece be directly above the centre of the fringe four measurement of this angle be make and the average space for each wavelength be calculate although there be technically six balmer line which lie in the visible part of the em spectrum only three of these line be visible under the condition of the laboratory this be perhaps due to external light in the laboratory such a that from desk lamp enter through the eyepiece or collimator cause the emission line to appear fainter the colour observe be red aqua and purple there be clearly distinguishable and these colour would not cause confusion when observe the emission line where n 2 2 and n 1 which be the element of the rydberg equation to produce a linear plot for find r. the gradient of the graph give u a value for r the rydberg constant four reading for the spectrometer angle be take for each maximum and the standard deviation be calculate so a to obtain an error associate with each value of the spectrometer angle these error tend to be very low which be why the error bar be virtually invisible on the graph show in figure 3. the graph give value for θ with very little error this be expect consider the quality of the result obtain the point fit very well with the best-fit line the value for θ a we previously have establish be related to the wavelength λ by equation 3. this mean that we can calculate the value for λ for each value of θ. the error be calculate use the fact that the error of sin θ be co θ × σ θ the error of sin θ be then add by quadrature to the error of d. the inverse of λ be then found in order that we have a linear plot when we plot λ −1 against the factor f .the correspond value of f 1 for each colour be then calculate and all the relevant data be show in table 1. table 1 vale of spectrometer diffraction angle θ and inverse of wavelength λ −1 and their associate error and the energy level change factor f for each colour of the balmer emission line from the hydrogen lamp balmer line colour θ/degrees figure 4 show the graph produce when λ −1 be plot against the correspond value of f the gradient of the graph give a value for r the rydberg constant the calculate value for r and it error be 1.083 × 10 7 ± 3.562 × 10 3 m −1 ±0.0329 the accepted value for the rydberg constant be 1.097×10 7 m −1 5 so it be clear to see that this accepted value do not lie in the bound of our experimentally produce value the percentage error for the experimental result be very small 0.0329 the very high precision of the spectrometer provide very small room for random error this be evident in the graph which have point which correlate with each other very closely only a single point on the aqua emission line graph show in figure 3 do not fit on the line of best-fit despite the low error chance of random error the final result be 1.28 different from the accepted value of r. however this be very likely to be because of a systematic error during the experimental procedure consider the value for λ that have be calculate be high than the accepted value for the balmer line this be displayed in table 2. here we can see that for b α and b γ the percentage difference be similar this suggests a possibility of a systematic error which provokes a high measurement for the value of λ. nonetheless we can not say this with certainty because the measure value for b β be small than the accepted value a potential source of error be the value for d the diffraction grate line space the value be not experimentally test during this investigation it be simply quote a 78.8 line per millimetre and thus an estimate of the error have to be make to test this value for d a light source of know wavelength such a a laser or a sodium light source should be shone through the spectrometer while use the same diffraction grate and the fringe space be measure consider the fact that for b α and b γ the wavelength be great than the true value it be possible that the fringe space be great than the value for d use 1.27×10 −5 m another source of error may have be the alignment of the diffraction grate during the experiment the diffraction grate be place perpendicular to the light source and hence to the collimator however have the grate be slightly rotate the calculate value for λ would have be different equation 4 1 show the more precise way to calculate the wavelength where d be the slit separation λ be the wavelength θ i be the angle of the light source to the grate normal and θ be the fringe space it be therefore very important to ensure that the grate be perpendicular to the source at all time discrete balmer emission line be use in this investigation to determine a value for rydberg 's constant r. light from a hydrogen lamp be analyse use a grate spectrometer with 78.8 line per millimetre the value for the fringe space appear to correlate very well with each other thanks to the very high precision of the equipment use the value and associate error for r obtain be 1.083 × 10 7 ± 3.562 × 10 3 m −1 ±0.0329 although the error for r be apparently low compare this to the

37,GS_KSN764_Redacted,"the rydberg constant an important constant in atomic physic be measure by use of a grate spectrometer this be achieve through measure the angle of diffraction of spectral line in the balmer series a series of hydrogen emission line these particular spectral line be chosen a they lie in the visible region of electromagnetic radiation make them easy to detect the value of these wavelength and their correspond energy level transition be then use to find the rydberg constant r∞ from the rydberg formula this be found to be 1.096 × 10 7 ± 1.4 × 10 5 m −1 this be 0.1σ from the accepted value of 1.0974 × 10 7 m −1 1 t he rydberg constant r ∞ be one of the most accurately measure fundamental physical constant 1 2 it have many u in quantum physic appear mainly in equation relate to the ionisation energy of specie the rydberg unit of energy denote r y rydberg atom and rydberg molecule be all example of these it be very relevant in current research and in 2016 researcher from the kaiserslautern university of technology and purdue university observe `` butterfly rydberg molecule `` where there be a weak pair of a rydberg atom with a separate atom in the ground state 3 r ∞ and the rydberg formula both arise from rutherford-bohr model an approximation of the structure of the atom it can also be described in term of more fundamental constant although the most accurate measurement of the rydberg constant come from measure it constituent and more fundamental constant our investigation be to find the rydberg constant through the measurement of transition wavelength in hydrogen a this be far easy to perform in a laboratory these wavelength come from a relatively simple formula know a the rydberg formula an equation which relates the wavelength of emit photon to the initial and final energy level of the atom they come from for a hydrogen atom the wavelength of light emit from an atom with a final energy level of 2 and an initial energy level of 3,4,5 etc fall within the visible region of electromagnetic radiation this series of wavelength be know a the balmer series after johann balmer a swiss mathematician and physicist who discover them and an equation to calculate them in 1885. due to the abundance of hydrogen in the universe this series be especially useful in astronomy these balmer line can appear a either absorption or emission line depend on the source for our experiment a hydrogen lamp be use and so emission line be observe and measure the emission line from the hydrogen lamp be analyse with a grate spectrometer this comprises of a collimator that pas light normally through a diffraction grate disperse the spectral line the angle of diffraction of these spectral line be then measure use an eyepiece that rotates freely about the grate fig 2. the grate spectrometer be use because of it high precision and accuracy enable the measurement of the wavelength of a give sample of light to nanometer precision once the value of the wavelength be know the rydberg formula can be use to find the rydberg constant by graphical analysis the rutherford-bohr model be one of the simplest approximation of the structure of the atom apply mostly classical physic in this model the electron orbit around the nucleus in the same way that planet orbit around a star if we consider an electron orbit a hydrogen nucleus it total energy must be described by where e be the total energy of the electron v be the potential energy of the electron and t be the kinetic energy of the electron a the only force between the nucleus and the electron in the model be the electromagnetic force it can be show that this total energy be give by where k be 4π 0 −1 with 0 be the permittivity of free space e be the magnitude of the charge of an electron and r be the radius of the `` orbit `` of the electron it can also be show that the angular momentum of the electron must be quantise and so combine these discrete value of velocity with the equivalence of centripetal and electrostatic force we find where n be an integer arise from the quantisation of angular momentum and m e be the mass of the electron when n 1 r give the bohr radius substitute this back into equation 1 we get an expression for the total energy of a give energy level n a an electron jump from a high energy level to a low one the difference in energy between these two level be emit a a photon see fig 1. equate this energy difference to the energy of a photon give where λ be the wavelength of the emit photon n 2 be the initial energy level n 1 be the final energy level make n 1 n 2 and r ∞ be the rydberg constant give by where c be the speed of light in a vacuum h be plank 's constant and α be the fine structure constant 4 give by it be from this definition of the rydberg constant that the high accuracy measurement have be make however a λ n 1 and n 2 be know it be not need for this experiment allow the use of equation 5 directly in derive the total energy of the electron it be assume that the mass of the nucleus when compare to the electron be infinite denote by the subscript ∞ consider a finite ratio between the two mass coffman show 5 that the formula becomes where with m e be the mass of the electron and m be the total mass of the nucleus although not necessary for this particular experiment the rydberg formula can also be expand to describe other element that behave in a similar manner to hydrogen with the formula where z be the atomic number of the element if we take equation 5 rearrange for λ use the accepted value of r ∞ a 1.0974 × 10 7 m −1 and take n 1 a 2 then we can find the value of λ for n 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... ∞ table i. a these value be only for hydrogen the first spectral line be commonly refer to a h-α the second h-β and so on the first four spectral line be in the visible spectrum and so can be detect by the human eye all other line with these parameter lie in the ultraviolet region this series of spectral line with n 1 2 be know a the balmer series although more in depth analysis of the diffraction grate be possible for determination of resolution and to show the presence of secondary peak only the principal maximum be use in this experiment if an arbitrary point be consider that be illuminate by a diffraction grate a principal maximum will only occur if the path difference between neighbour slit to the give point be an integer multiple of 2π this mean that the phase difference φ be give by where s be the path difference between adjacent slit k be the wavenumber and m be a positive or negative integer a s d sin θ and k 2π λ then give and so through measurement of θ and m with the grate spectrometer determination of λ be possible for a give colour these value of λ can then be use with equation 5 to find r ∞ before start the experiment equation 5 be use along with the accepted value of the rydberg constant to calculate the expect wavelength of the first five spectral line of the balmer series table i. these wavelength be then convert into visible colour with colour chart from these value it be predict that all line with n 2 ≥ 5 would be in the ultraviolet range and so it be expect that four line would be visible to the eye the hydrogen lamp use to produce the spectral line would overheat if left on for more than approximately 15 minute when this occurs the lamp no longer produce accurate spectral line and will not turn on before cool to low temperature in extreme case this can cause permanent damage to the lamp for this reason the initial calibration of the grate spectrometer be do use a sodium lamp a a substitute this be use a the sodium lamp produce clear spectral line in a similar manner to the hydrogen lamp whilst not suffer from overheat the collimator and diffraction grate see fig 2 have to be perfectly align to ensure light would be incident normally on the diffraction grate minimise the error in the position reading the eyepiece be first focus on the cross-hair with an object 5-10m away the opposite wall of the laboratory be use the collimator be then calibrate by adjust the focus of the collimator until the source through the slit be at it sharpest a see through the eyepiece the slit width be minimise but not so much that the observe spectral line become hard to view the purpose of these step be both to minimise eye strain and to minimise the spread in the spectral line minimise the error in θ. the camera be then rotate by exactly 90 • and a mirror use in place of the diffraction grate to precisely align the diffraction grate mount the diffraction grate use have 2001 line per inch approximately 78.8 line per mm it be predict that four wavelength would be visible when use the hydrogen lamp table i. however initially only the red and aqua line be observe upon replace the hydrogen lamp the red aqua and violet spectral line be then visible but not dark blue from discussion with other team it become apparent that many lamp be not show all of the expect spectral line and so we decide to use the lamp despite only be able to observe three wavelength the cause of this be unknown however it be likely due to fig 2. a simplify top-down deconstruction of a grate spectrometer 4 the source slit collimator and grate remain fix whilst the camera crosshair and eyepiece rotate freely about the grate omit be the vernier scale in arc minute use to measure angle of rotation θ. for the gradient and their associate error see table ii either overheat of the lamp from previous usage or from other manufacturing defect the position of the spectral line of each colour be then measure by align the cross-hair of the eyepiece with the centre of the line the value on the vernier scale of the grate spectrometer be then record a the scale be in arc minute the error in θ be ±1 for each colour the position of the central line be measure follow by 3-5 line either side depend on their clarity the central line be of order 0 and far line along increase θ be decide to be of increase order and vice versa when the brightness of the line be such that their colour could not be determine with relative ease their position be no longer record to reduce the chance of the lamp overheat due to prolong usage reading be take for period of 5-10 minute with break of a few minute in between to allow to the lamp to cool to obtain a quantitative measurement of the error in the position of the spectral line the width of the 0 th order line of each colour be directly measure for later use see section iv-b this be do by take two position measurement one for each side of the fringe the wavelength of each spectral line be found from equation 13. this give λ a the gradient of the plot of d sin θ against m fig 3. the value of the calculate gradient in table ii all contain the expect value of λ from table i within their associate margin of error equation 5 be then use with the value of λ and n 2 from table ii to calculate the rydberg constant fig 4. through swap the two reciprocal term of n 2 1 an n 2 2 the gradient becomes r ∞ this give r ∞ to be 1.096×10 7 ±1.4×10 5 m −1 the accepted value of r ∞ be 1.0974 × 10 7 m −1 meaning that the calculate result be 0.1σ from the accepted value the main source of error within the dataset be from the human judgement of the centre of the spectral line to quantify this rather than estimate an uncertainty the width of an individual fringe of each wavelength be measure see section iii-b through subtract the great of these two angle from the other and combine the error for each in quadrature the total width of the line could be found halve the width and then combine this with it associate error in quadrature give the total error in each line position measurement for each wavelength see table iii this spread of each line be cause by the finite width of the slit and the diffraction of the light a it pas through it this effect be far amplify by any error in the focus of the collimator and the camera lens arrangement lead to a small but measurable spread in the observe position of each line error in the calibration of the grate spectrometer i.e the light not be normally incident on the diffraction grate also lead to systematic error in the line position these effect be mostly remove by use of a linear regression model all far calculate error be found from these line of regression initially the calculate wavelength of the violet light be found to be great than that of the aqua colour it be widely i. this meant that n 1 2 and n 2 3 4 and 6 a dark blue be not observe the gradient r∞ be found to be 1.096 × 10 7 ± 1.4 × 10 5 m −1 accepted that this be not true upon inspection of the violet data fig 5 it be found that at the two end of the dataset the position deviate dramatically whereas the central section remain linear and closely match the expect value upon remove these anomalous data point the gradient of the trend line of the central data point give a value far closer to the expect value calculate beforehand this new value be use in the calculation of r ∞ the cause of these peculiar anomaly may have be down to mis-association of the colour to the record line position a the brightness of the line decrease with distance from the central line this could explain why only the outermost line be anomalous many other dark line be observe however a their colour could not be determine accurately they be not record overall the error in the final result be reasonable consider it be found from only three data point fig 4. ideally all four wavelength would have be visible and repeat measurement of each spectral line would have be take to far reduce the error in r ∞ unfortunately due to the lack of another replacement hydrogen lamp and the lack of laboratory time allocate this be not possible both of these factor greatly increase the error in the final value the aim of the experiment be to find the rydberg constant through measurement of the spectral line of the balmer series through use of the rydberg formula r ∞ be found to be 1.096 × 10 7 ± 1.4 × 10 5 m −1 this be 0.1σ from the accepted value of 1.0974 × 10 7 m −1 this final error be mainly due to the lack of repeat be take and due to only three of the four wavelength be visible in future the accuracy of the experiment could have be greatly improve through

38,GS_XUQ367_Redacted,in this investigation we be determine the rydberg constant use hydrogen lamp and spectrometer we estimate the constant to be 1.046±0.022x𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 the accepted value for the constant be 1.097x𝟏𝟎 𝟕 𝒎 −𝟏 therefore the experiment be 4.65 accurate in the experiment we use a spectrometer and hydrogen lamp the spectrometer be an effective way to determine wavelength of light precisely and accurately by measure wavelength of the light that be emit from a hydrogen lamp we can determine the rydberg constant a the wavelength of light emit related to the rydberg formula for one of the wavelength measure we gain an anomalous result that be not part of any model in the rydberg formula although measurement for the other two wavelength do fit the model that the rydberg formula provide for this experiment we be determine the rydberg constant by observe the diffraction pattern when a beam of light from the emission of a hydrogen lamp be shone through a diffraction grate the light from a hydrogen lamp be not make up of a continuous spectrum of light but of distinct colour the distinct colour be due to the quantisation of energy level in electron in the hydrogen atom a the hydrogen gas be excite the electron in the hydrogen be promote energy level that be distinct and quantise see appendix a for diagram when the electron lose energy they be demote energy level and release a photon of light a the difference in energy level be distinct and not continuous only photon of certain wavelength be emit these wavelength can be estimate use spectroscopy technique the wavelength relates to the rydberg constant and the energy level the electron be promote to in the experiment the wavelength be determine use spectroscopy technique from multiple grate diffraction theory the wavelength of light can be estimate for the light emit and from this the rydberg constant be estimate the rydberg constant be very important in atomic physic and even in astrophysics the rydberg constant can predict the wavelength of light emit for hydrogen and ionise element with the same number of electron a hydrogen the rydberg constant can be use to model wavelength of photon emit in excite hydrogen thus it have important application in astrophysics by observe light from star or any other celestial body astronomer can shine the light through a grate similar to the one we use in the experiment can confirm presence of hydrogen 1 to determine the rydberg constant the value of the wavelength emit from the excite hydrogen must be estimate this be do by a graph the graph be sin theta against order of maximum this mean that the gradient be equivalent to the wavelength of light emit the light observe be red cyan green and blue with wavelength calculate to be 487.2±7.3nm 659.3±2.7nm 532.6±9.6nm respectively from this we get the rydberg constant to measure 1.046±0.022x10 7 𝑚 −1 this experiment u multiple grate diffraction theory to estimate the wavelength of the emit light the grate be make of equally space narrow slit each with a distance between them of d. suppose there be phase difference of neighbour ray of wavelength λ if the phase difference be an integer multiple of 2π then there be constructive interference of maximum intensity a show in appendix b the path difference be dsinθ the phase difference be calculate by 1 where ϕ be the phase difference a we be interested in the diffraction pattern for when there be a maximum constructive interference we know that ϕ be equivalent to 2πm where m=0 ±1 ±2 .. etc therefore we can equate 1.1 to 1.2 determine the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and spectrometer by cancel the 2π term and multiply by λ we derive 1.3 which we use for the analysis of result for the spectrometer 1.3 λ be related to the rydberg constant by 1.4 2 this be due to quantum effect of the electron in the hydrogen atom the electron in the hydrogen atom be at specific energy level when the hydrogen atom be in an excite state the electron be raise by an energy level or to even high specific energy level once the hydrogen atom be not in an excite state the electron in the excite state demotes an energy level when this happens photon be emit from the atom the energy of this photon be equivalent to the difference in energy of the electron energy level therefore in 1.4 p equal the final energy level and n equal the energy level of the electron in the excite state for visible light to be emit the electron 's final state be in the p=2 state any high would result in the photon be emit have a wavelength in the region of infrared light if the final state be low the photon will be in the uv spectrum in the experiment we be determine the wavelength of the light emit we research the balmer series for hydrogen appendix b so n and p be know 4 rearrange 1.4 can give a result for the rydberg constant iii method figure 1 show an example of a very similar spectrometer use 3 the slow motion drive or rotate table varies the angle of the eyepiece with cross hair the cross hair be line up with maximas when the angle θ be measure on the slow motion drive a the spectral line be of a certain thickness due to the slit before the collimator this provide an uncertainty in θ. we determine the uncertainty to be half the thickness of the spectral line a the true angle of maximum could lie within the region of the spectral line at the central maximum θ=0 and this be the point where the eye piece and the collimator where completely parallel to each other it be also require that the plane of the grate be exactly perpendicular to the collimator and be perfectly level this be so that 1.3 be valid we make sure that this be the case by the follow step first we align the eyepiece with the collimator without put in the diffraction grate next we rotate the eyepiece by 90˚ and clamped it into position the eyepiece and collimator be therefore perpendicular to each other we then place the grate in the holder and rotate it until we could see the reflect image of the slit align with the cross hair of the eyepiece this meant that now the grate be at an angle of 45˚ a show by figure 3. when this point be reach we rotate the grate by exactly 45 degree this assure that the grate plane be perpendicular to the light beam come out the collimator the eye piece be then rotate 90 degree exactly so that the eye piece and telescope axis be parallel to the light beam to obtain value of theta the telescope be rotate use the fine adjustment screw on the rotate table and the value of theta be read off on a vernier scale the vernier scale have a precision of 1 arc minute the hydrogen lamp be not like other lamp and can not be kept on for a long time we estimate the rydberg constant to be 1.046±0.022x10 7 𝑚 −1 this be close to the accepted value of 1.097x10 7 𝑚 −1 2 we observe the hydrogen to emit three distinct colour blue red and cyan green with wavelength 487.2±2.3nm 659.3±2.7nm 532.6±3.6nm respectively below show a graph of sin θ a a function of m. there be a strong linear fit with the graph and small uncertainty in value of sin θ for each of the colour the gradient of this graph be equivalent to the wavelength of the light divide by the distance between the slit grate there be small uncertainty with the estimation of the wavelength when research the balmer series 4 the value of the wavelength for light emit be similar for the blue and red spectral line for the red light beam the wavelength be meant to be 656.1nm which be very close to our value of 659.3nm and for the blue light beam the wavelength be meant to be 486.0nm which be again close to our estimate value of 487.2nm however the presence of light with the 532.6nm wavelength be not part of the balmer series this result be also not due to one anomalous result a the graph show a strong linear fit with each of the distinct colour a possible cause for this be that there be another light source go through the diffraction pattern but this seem unlikely a the measurement of the wavelength for this light be very precise and if this be the case it would have have to be a laser therefore we do not calculate the rydberg constant for this light beam when we estimate the rydberg constant we obtain value for the rydberg constant for the individual light beam and take the mean a the result infront of the collimator be a slit that make the light source a light beam however the slit have certain thickness and provide an uncertainty in theta a the light beam have a certain thickness we estimate the result of theta a the central part of the beam to measure the uncertainty we record theta the edge of the ligh tbeam the uncertainty be the difference in theta for the edge of the light beam and we divide this by a half below show a visualisation of the measurement of the uncertainty,extended,none,,,
39,GS_GTD911_Redacted,"the emission spectrum of hot hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the visible transition wavelength which lie on balmer series be observe and measure the rydberg constant r∞ which relates the energy level in the atom to the transition wavelength be calculate the value of r∞ obtain be 1.10±0.04 × 10 7 m -1 the result be what we expect and it also verifies the rydberg formula spectroscopy be the study of electromagnetic spectrum which be the wavelength composition of light due to atomic and molecular interaction a grate spectrometer u a diffract grate to disperse the incident polychromatic light into it constituent monochromatic component 3 in this experiment the emission spectrum of hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the rydberg formula explains the relation between the transition wavelength and the energy level with the proportionality constant be the rydberg constant the information about the wavelength of the emission spectrum be use to deduce the rydberg constant the word spectrum be first apply by isaac newton to describe the rainbow of colour that combine to form white light during the early 1800s joseph von fraunhofer conduct experiment with dispersive spectrometer that enable spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique 4 since then spectroscopy have become important in the study of physic and it be equally crucial in the astronomical biological chemical metallurgical and other analytical investigation 3 figure 2.0 show the electromagnetic spectrum of light that range from radio wave to gamma ray correspond to their wavelength 8 the electromagnetic spectrum can be anything from long infrared all the way down to gamma ray a show by figure 2.0. the light might have originate from anything from a cool crystal to a superhot plasma or from a star 1 the light spectrum generally take one of two form firstly hot solid such a a tungsten lamp filament emits a continuous spectrum of intensity that vary with wavelength secondly hot or electrically excite gas release spectrum that have concentrate emission at a few well-defined wavelength a see from the slit of the spectrometer a show by figure 2.1. this form be call 'emission line spectrum the ratio of intensity of spectral line for example can provide information about the density of the emit gas or the density of the free electron in an electrical discharge since the spectroscopy be a `` non-invasive `` technique it be one of the most powerful tool available to physicist 1 figure 2.1. show the emission spectrum of various element these line have well define position which correspond to well-defined wavelength 9 these gas also show 'absorption line spectrum which occurs when a continuous white light be pas through their cool state instead of emit spectral line the gas absorb the well-defined wavelength of light and reemit in random direction result in dark line in a continuous spectrum a see in figure 2.2 2 however the focus of the experiment will be on the emission line spectrum of hot hydrogen lamp determine the rydberg constant use the grate spectrometer the absorption spectrum of helium with well-defined dark line on the continuous spectrum of white light 10 a spectrometer need a dispersive object to disperse or separate the different wavelength of the incident light spatially 3 in our experiment we use a diffraction grate diffraction be a wave phenomenon that occurs when a wave encounter an obstacle or a slit 2 a grate can be consider a a large n of equally space very narrow slit 1 each slit be separate by a distance d 1 where m be the order number 1,2 here m take value of 0 1 and 2. in this experiment the value at the opposite direction take negative value such -1 and -2. the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen be divide into a number of spectral series spectral emission occurs when an electron transition from a high energy state to a low energy state to differentiate the two state the low energy state be designate a p and the high energy state be designate a n. since the energy of each state be fix the energy difference between the state be fix and the transition will always produce a photon with the same energy 5 hydrogen atom correspond to the wavelength of the photon emit 13 this experiment focus on balmer series since lyman series and paschen series do not involve photon that lie in the visible range so the value of p in this case be 2. the energy difference between level and hence the wavelength of emit photon be give by the rydberg formula 5 where r∞ be the rydberg constant which have the measure value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 it can be express in term of more fundamental constant a where me be the mass of electron c be the speed of light h be plank 's constant and α be the fine structure constant the value of 1/α ≈ 137.036 1,6 before proceed to make measurement the spectrometer be first properly alinged and focus firstly the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire `` x `` to find a set that do not strain the eye the instrument be brought outside the work space to a window the camera lens be focus so that a distant object be focus on the cross wire the distant object chosen be another window across the street since the distant in this context mean 5 to 10 metre 1 the telescope be set so that it be alinged with the axis of the collimator the hydrogen lamp be position close to the slit so that it be illuminate without change the camera focus the focus of the collimator be adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire the slit be adjust to it minimum width and the cross wire be set a an `` x `` rather than a a `` `` it be checked how the clamp screw and the slow motion drive work the camera and collimator be alinged so the cross wire be set on the slit image the telescope be move through precisely 90 deg by note the intial and final position on the vernier scale and clamped in position a mirror be put in the holder and the ruling be ensure approximately vertical the grate table that hold the mirror be turn until a reflect image of the slit be observe in the eyepiece this indicates the grate surface be at 45 deg to the incident from the collimator the height of this image be adjust use the adjustment screw under the grate table the reading be note the grate be rotate through precisely 45 degree use the scale so that it be accurately set at 0 deg normal incidence the mirror be replace with a grate slit the telescope be then move out of the way and look into the grate the telescope be move around to find the diffract image of the slit if the image be above or below the plane define by the cross wire the grate adjustment screw be use to rotate the grate in the plane of it surface until the image be at right height the spectrometer be now set up to make measurement the hydrogen lamp be only switch on whenever the measurement be go to be make since it get hots and the intensity of the emission line drop until they be not visible in the eyepiece the grate slit that have 78.8 line per mm 1 be chosen since it show more emission line up to 3 order number the hydrogen lamp be turn on and the diffract image be observe in the eyepiece the position of the centre of the diffration pattern be measure here the centre represent the zeroth order in the grate equation i.e eq 2.2. the first order m=1 of emission line be observe in the first order one of the emission line look red and it position be record the step above be repeat for the second and third order and the order in the opposite direction the second visible wavelength be blue the position of the blue emission line be measure in the same manner a red 's the third visible emission line look bluish purple however the intensity of the third emission line be very low so the grate slit be change to another one with 300 line per mm 1 which provide high resolution but only the first and second order can be observe my partner and i take reading of the position of the same line alteratively to get a value for the uncertainty in the angle turn θ. the entire measure process be repeat multiple time for the three different emission line to increase the accuracy all reading be record on the lab book and then transfer to the computer to be analyse eq 2.2 implies a plot of the sin θ vs. m will yield a straight line a plot of sin θ a a function of m be plot on python for each transition wavelength use the information about the slope the wavelength of each emission line be determine with their uncertainty for each wavelength the rydberg constant be deduce with it uncertainty the plot of sin θ vs. m be plot on python for each transition wavelength the slope of the plot from figure 4.3 be 0.1294±0.0008 the d use be 3.33 × 10 -6 m. this be different from those use for previous plot since the grate slit be change for well resolution the wavelength of the emission line obtain be 4.3±0.1 × 10 -7 m. the error in the angle of the emission line θ for each transition wavelength be calculate from the standard deviation of the data the error in the wavelength for purple emission line be increase to 0.1×10 -7 m from a very small error since the intensity of the line be very low i suspect the error be big than the value obtain from standard deviation in summary the transition wavelength be give on the table below by compare the colour observe with the figure 2.6 the result be very similar visually but the second emission line be actually aqua light blue and the third one be blue not purple apart from that the wavelength do correspond to the colour observe in figure 2.6. also the forth emission line violet which be suppose to be visible be not observe this could be due to low intensity of the hydrogen lamp provide the rydberg constant r∞ be calculate for each transition wavelength by use eq 2.3. since the spectral line on balmer series be of the visible wavelength the wavelength obtain from the experiment correspond to the balmer series therefore the value of p energy level of the final level in this experiment be 2. the result be summarise by the table below colour n λ 10 -7 m r∞ 10 the average of the value of r∞ obtain be 1.10±0.04 × 10 7 m -1 the percentage difference when compare to the measure value be 0.2 the measure value also lie within the range of the average 1.06,1.14 × 10 7 m -1 the error in the average be relatively large thus result in a large range however the measure value be very close to the average there be a few possible source of error which could have affected the final result for example the hydrogen lamp get hot and the intensity drop make it difficult to spot the line we also change the lamp for a few time and the position of the lamp might have be change sometimes the whole set up be move by accident which could have cause the set up to be misalingned hence a set up fix to table must be use with a well long last hydrogen lamp even though the experiment be carry out in a dark room there be table lamp on our neighbour table which could have affected the incident light into the diffraction grate therefore an opaque shield should be use to cover it leave a hole for the eyepiece besides the grate holder could have be move during the change of the grate slit the temperature and humidity be possible error source too since they can affect the system optic 3 therefore the temperature and humidity should be monitor and regulate during the experiment the emission spectrum produce by hot hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the visible transition wavelength which lie on balmer series be observe and measure the rydberg constant r∞ which relates the energy level in the atom to the transition wavelength be calculate the value of r∞ obtain be 1.10±0.04 × 10 7 m -1 when compare to the measure value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 the percentage difference be 0.2 the result be what we expect this also verifies the rydberg formula i.e eq 2.3. it should be note that the grate spectrometer be highly accurate and the lab script claim to give a precision of ±0.2nm for the wavelength of yelloworange light if repeat measurement be take 1 since the small error in λ we can achieve be ±4nm we be still a long way from reach the uncertainty of ±0.2nm therefore the experiment should be repeat multiple time with more careful procedure consider the step discus in the previous section apart from that this experiment only investigates the visible transition wavelength of hydrogen i.e balmer series the other spectral line such a those from lyman series and paschen series should be study and be use to determine the rydberg constant a they be also related to it by eq 2.3 5 besides hydrogen any hydrogen-like element can be use to determine r∞ too 5",extended,bal,,,

42,GS_CTW087_Redacted,the purpose of this report be to display the result of my experiment in which i attempt to calculate the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer the rydberg constant be a value which relates the frequency of photon emission which result from the transition of electron between discrete energy level in the atom the measurement be take use a collimator and a camera fit to a vernier scale with the use of a diffraction grate with 300 line per mm the final result of the experiment be 1.1005±0.0004 𝒎 −𝟏 this value be within less than 0.5 of the previously know value make the experiment successful pectroscopy be an extremely useful tool for scientific analysis it be a non-invasive technique which u light from a source to analyse the property of a substance or material the absorption or emission spectrum of the analyse material can provide key insight into the composition of the substance a specific element and compound have specific spectrum which they can absorb or emit for the purpose of this experiment hot hydrogen gas be use and it emission line be observe through a diffraction grate the eventual outcome of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant by use the relationship between wavelength and the degree of diffraction to calculate the wavelength of the light which the lamp emits the rydberg constant relates the wavelength of emit photon from a hydrogen atom for electron transmission between energy level for the purpose of this experiment a it be do by human observation the balmer emission series be use a it produce visible wavelength of light to calculate the wavelength of the light a spectrometer be use comprise of a collimator camera and vernier scale moreover the error in the calculate value be often on the order of a percent due to the precision of spectroscopy a a method however the rydberg constant can be use to calculate the wavelength of light emit from electron transition between any energy level outline below be additional theory which be require to understand the full detail of how the experiment work regard diffraction grate and the rydberg constant the diffraction grate can be assume to be a set of parallel narrow slit with separation d. thus if light of wavelength λ pas through a the grate a principle maximum occurs when all of the beam have a path difference which be a whole number of wavelength hence phase difference between adjacent wave be an integer multiple of 2π a show in equation 1.1 a path difference be 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 where θ be the deflection from the ray initial path then it follow hence plot 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 against 𝜆 produce a straight line from which the gradient can be use to get an accurate value of 𝜆. the rydberg equation be a direct outcome of the quantum behaviour of electron a they can only occupy discrete energy level in the atom when electron in the hydrogen atom transition between energy level from high to low they release photon a the transition energy be discrete only certain wavelength of light be emit the equation 2.1 relates this in a remarkably simple fashion where the initial energy level be denote by n and the final level be denote by p. for visible wavelength emission there be p=2 and n=3 4 and 5. hence there should be 3 visible wavelength the measure value of the 𝑅 ∞ be 10 973 721.6 𝑚 −1 it be also give by equation 2.2 where 𝑚 𝑒 be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light in a vacuum and h be plank 's constant finally 𝛼 be the fine structure constant give by 2.3 𝑒 2 4𝜋ħ𝜀 0 2.3 calculate the rydberg constant use a hydrogen lamp and a grate spectrometer a. spectrometer setup prior to any measurement take it be vital to calibrate the spectrometer so that the measurement we take be accurate the follow procedure align and focus the instrument it be key to note that once one part of a calibration be complete it be n't change during the experiment a it could have effect measurement take 1. we focus the eyepiece on the cross wire by turn the eyepiece it be preferable to have the crosshairs a an x than a '+ 2. we then go to a window and focus the camera lens on a distant object to by twist the camera 3. then we align the collimator and camera and turn on a sodium lamp this be use in place of hydrogen lamp a the hydrogen lamp overheats and can only be on for 15 minute at a time turn the slit to it narrow set to reduce our error then we align the middle of the cross hair to the center of the sodium beam 4. we note the reading on the vernier scale at that point remember that the large reading be in degree and the small one be in arcminute 5. then we move the camera through 90 degree towards ourselves when we do this we make sure the other part of the spectrometer be lock in place and we rotate the vernier scale 45 degree in the opposite direction so that it would end up in the same place after the camera be move and not underneath the collimator hence we could still read it and take a measurement 6. we then place a mirror in the slot until we could see a reflect beam exactly in the middle of the crosshairs meaning that the camera be at exactly 90 degree to the collimator 7. we again note the vernier scale reading we subtract 90 degree from this reading and move the camera back around so that it be at precisely 0 degree to the normal hence make it perfectly align 8. the final step be to replace the mirror with the grate our image be level they do not change height in the horizontal plane and hence no far adjustment be need then we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp align the crosshairs with the central maximum of the lamp we chose the 300 line per mm a we have a stiff camera the 300 line per mm grate a oppose to the 80 would give few maximum but have them more spread out hence there be less chance of u slide past one without notice which would have make our data inaccurate however the down side be that there be few maximum to measure and hence the uncertainty in the wavelength we calculate be great moreover the slit be a narrow a possible so the width of each maximum be small reduce the uncertainty in the position of the maximum a each measurement would have an uncertainty which be half of the width of the beam finally use the eyepiece we observe the position a 𝜃 minus the angle at the central maximum on the vernier scale for each of the three wavelength purple blue and red each have a minimum of 4 measurable maximum with red have an extra 2 and blue have an extra 1. the first calculation be to find the wavelength of each of the emission line by plot 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 𝜆 which would give a straight line graph with a gradient of show the calculate wavelength and their uncertainty the error in the gradient be calculate use the standard error of the repeat we take for each wavelength and compute in python use a covariance matrix the error in the wavelength be due to the difficulty in locate where the center of each maximum be a the error be half of the width of the beam this be minimize by have the slit at it narrow set find the constant itself be a simple calculation use equation 2. this be within 0.28 of the expect value of 10 973 731.6 𝑚 −1 and have a very small error suggest our experimental procedure be accurate perhaps use the 80 line per mm grate would have yield a small error in the wavelength a there be more maximum to measure however due to the limitation of our stiff camera we could not do this however if we be to repeat the experiment we would choose a well spectrometer and make this adjustment perhaps get a value closer to the know one the aim of this experiment be to verify the remarkable relationship between photon emission and electron transition in hydrogen atom through the use of spectroscopy the experiment be indeed successful and the value we found be with 0.28 of the know value this be testament to the remarkably low error in spectrometer measurement and our own conscious effort to minimize error perhaps the only flaw be that we sacrifice have more maximum to measure by use the 300 line per mm grate a oppose to the 80 line per mm due to the limitation of our equipment if we be to repeat the experiment we would use a well function spectrometer and use the 80 line per mm grate to reduce the uncertainty in our value of wavelength perhaps a more technical extension would be to use apparatus which could detect the paschen and lyman emission series the lyman series emits ultraviolet photon a n=1 and the paschen series emits infrared radiation a n=3 then there would be 9 measurable wavelength of light and reduce the standard error 𝜎 √𝑛 a n would be nine hence the value would be even more accurate,superficial,bal,,,

be when from here the theoretical value of the rydberg constant can be calculate with know value of h e k m 6 give r ∞ 1.097 × 10 7 m −1 which be similar to the literature value of 10973731.6m −1 give in the first year lab manual 7 grate spectrometer resolution with reference to figure 3 the phase difference ∆φ due to the grate that form a constructive interference be give by where d be the slit separation θ the angle from the zeroth order maximum and m the order of the maximum equation 14 then reduces to the minimum be give by which change to when there be contribution from n slit when there be two similar wavelength incident on the diffraction grate the intensity of the resultant emission spectrum form by the two wavelength will have peak very close to each other a show in figure 4. figure 4 the resultant emission spectrum form from light of two similar wavelength note the difference between ∆λ and ∆l which be difference in wavelength and resolve power respectively 7 if the difference in wavelength ∆λ be great than the resolve power ∆l of the grate a doublet would be see if ∆λ be small than ∆l than the grate spectrometer would fail to resolve the two peak for the purpose of the follow derivation it can be assume that resolve power ∆l equal difference in wavelength ∆λ light from the second wavelength be give by λ 2 λ 1 − ∆λ equation 14 and equation 17 be combine use λ 2 yield which reduces to equation 15 and equation 19 be then combine under λ λ 1 to form which together with definition λ 1 − λ 2 ∆λ yield from equation 21 it can be see that a the number of slit n on the grate decrease the resolution ∆λ increase hence the number of slit n remain at the point when the doublet disappears give the resolution ∆l and wavelength difference between the two light ∆λ classify a a g-type main-sequence star the sun be know to contain an abundance of hydrogen and helium 8 in the center where nuclear fusion occurs white light be produce and certain spectral be absorbed by chemical element present in the atmosphere of the sun figure 5 show the fraunhofer line associate with the sun by burning certain elemental salt in a candle flame and examine the light produce the composition of the sun can be analyse if an element produce the emission spectral line which match an absorption spectral line see in the fraunhofer line it can be conclude the sun contains say element for the purpose of this experiment it can be see that the atmosphere of the sun contains sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen the experimental set-up be divide into two phase calibration and data collection with reference to figure 6 the eyepiece crosswire camera lens be brought into focus on a distant object the telescope and collimator be then brought into alignment and the hydrogen lamp use a the source the focus of the spectrometer be then adjust until a sharp image of the zeroth order spectral line be visible next the telescope be move clockwise by 90 degree and a 78.8 line per mm grate place in the holder the grate table be turn and the height of the table adjust until the slit be again visible the grate be then rotate to be in alignment with the telescope and collimator thus conclude the calibration phase of the experiment for the rydberg constant experiment the order of the spectral line along with it colour be tabulate a a function of the reading on the vernier scale for the spectrometer resolution experiment a sodium lamp be place at the source and the telescope be direct at the small order where a doublet can be see a black piece of cardboard be slide from left to right between the grate and the object slowly until the doublet disappears at this point the ratio of the length of the grate cover up and the total length be estimate by eye for the fraunhofer line experiment a total of four salt be provide sodium chloride iron fill copper sulfate and magnesium oxide a candle be lit use a bunsen burner and the grate spectrometer point at the candle a ladle of the chosen salt be add into the flame and the color of the emission spectrum record and checked use the fraunhofer line show in figure 5. first it be note that all four spectral line h-alpha h-beta h-gamma and h-delta be see in the emission spectrum this be show in figure 7. the order of the balmer series a a function of the vernier scale reading be tabulate in table 1. set the zeroth order a the 0 degree a graph of sinθ against m for the red spectral line and blue spectral line be plot this be show in figure 8 and 9. from equation 15 it could be see that λ d slope since d 1 n 1 78.8mm 7 the value of λ could be derive from the slope of figure 8 and 9. this value of λ be then fed into equation 1 with the appropriate integer value of n 3 4 5 give an average value of r ∞ 10729936.11m −1 compare this with the establish literature value the relative difference be found to be small than 10 and therefore reliable the grate spectrometer resolution it be estimate that half of the total length of the slit be cover when the doublet disappear hence use equation 21 it be found that ∆λ 0.205nm where m 2 λ 2 589 × 10 −9 n 1 2 × 36mm × 80 line per mm the theoretical value for ∆λ be calculate from the follow ∆λ 589.6 − 589.0 0.6nm 24 although the experimental value be in the same order of magnitude a the theoretical value the relative difference be which be great than 10 and not reliable out of the four salt test iron filing and copper sulfate do not produce an emission spectrum sodium chloride produce yellow spectral line in correspondence to fraunhofer designation d and magnesium oxide produce red spectral line in correspondence to fraunhofer designation a a see in figure 5. qualitatively the experiment successfully capture the four spectral line h-alpha h-beta h-gamma and hdelta in the balmer series quantitatively the experiment determine the rydberg constant to a relative difference with the establish literature of 2 since the relative difference be small than 10 the experiment be consider consistent with theory these result be significant a they verify the emission spectral line associate with hydrogen which be commonly found in ionize interstellar hydrogen know a h ii region in astrophysics a nasa photograph of the orion nebula confirms this observation a show in figure 10. although the experimental value for resolution be determine to the same order of magnitude a the theoretical value the relative difference be large than 10 and hence be consider unreliable this inaccuracy of result could be due to an oversimplification in theory which do not account for how the spectrometer and it lens could contribute to an overall resolution this observation be back up by two fact firstly the theory predict that the pair of doublet in sodium lamp should merge into one when in fact one of the doublet simply disappear secondly both doublet disappear together when the source be a hydrogen lamp which should not happen accord to the theory this meant a more sophisticated theory accounting for the spectrometer 's contribution in resolution along with an increase care take during experiment would be necessary for future improvement figure 10 an astronomical photo of the orion nebula with easily identifiable h-alpha and h-delta spectral region locate in the center with h-beta and h-gamma region locate in the fringe 11 fraunhofer line refer to the fraunhofer line see in figure 5 it could be postulate that the solar composition contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen take an abridge table from a paper publish by the araa annual review of astronomy and astrophysics a see in figure 11 it could be see that the postulate be in fact correct figure 11 a breakdown of solar atmosphere composition show that the sun do contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen 12 iron filing do not produce a temperature a it melt point 1500 • c be great than the temperature of the candle 1400 • c although copper sulfate may have produce a green emission spectrum it be unclear whether if the result be due to a contamination of the candle flame hence the experimenter decide to err on the side of caution and discard the result for copper sulfate overall the experiment be consider consistent with theoretical prediction since the four spectral line predict by the theory be observe and rydberg constant be determine to a relative difference of 2 the result be consistent with theory for grate spectrometer resolution the discrepancy between the experimental resolution and theoretical resolution be too large 66 10 and hence a more careful treatment theoretically and experimentally would be warrant for fraunhofer line the result be consistent with the theory of araa which demonstrate that the sun 's atmosphere contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen hence the primary aim of the experiment be attain whilst the secondary aim obtain mixed success,deep,exp,,,
44,GS_KGR276_Redacted,the rydberg constant allows one to predict how the atomic spectrum of various element should behave and the aim of this first year laboratory experiment be to calculate a value for the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer to take measurement on the diffraction pattern from a hydrogen gas lamp the first few transition wavelength for hydrogen 's balmer series be calculate to within ±0.6 of currently accepted high precision measurement 1 these transition wavelength be then use in conjunction with rydberg/bohr 's formula to calculate the rydberg constant a 1.094 ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 this demonstrates the high level of accuracy and precision that can be achieve use spectroscopy the rydberg constant express in shorthand a r ∞ be a constant use most notably in rydberg/bohr 's relation that accurately predicts the transition wavelength for hydrogen the aim of this first year laboratory experiment be to use a grate spectrometer to measure the rydberg constant to a high degree of accuracy the rydberg constant first arose in johannes rydberg 's pioneer work on the hydrogen spectrum but with no explanation for the physic behind what be be observe later in bohr 's model for the hydrogen atom a physical explanation be provide to derive the same relation which accurately model the energy transition between orbital level 2 spectrometer be important instrument use in the study of light spectrum from various source and be use extensively in multiple field across physic for example in astrophysics where a great deal of the research on the chemical composition of the universe utilizes spectrometer by use a spectrometer to measure the transition wavelength emit by a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp bohr's/rydberg 's model for the hydrogen transition wavelength can be use to deduce the rydberg constant since the spectrometer be capable of very accurate measurement it should be possible to achieve a value for r ∞ within 1 of the currently accepted value of 10 973 731.568 508 ± 0.000 065 m -1 3 bohr 's model hypothesize that the energy level in a hydrogen atom correspond to stable orbit that the electron can take around the nucleus and that the electron can only exist in one of these discrete orbit bohr argue that the angular momentum of the orbit electron be quantize and use classical mechanic mixed with the idea of quantize angular momentum he derive the follow equation that describes the total energy of the electron in the n th permit energy level/orbit where e n be the total energy in the n th orbit m be the electron mass e be the electron charge and h be planck 's constant by equate the difference between 2 energy level to the energy of a photon it can be show that the transition wavelength for hydrogen be give by where n be the initial energy level of the electron p be the final energy level λ be the transition wavelength and r ∞ be the rydberg constant which bohr have show can be express in term of more fundamental physic constant a r ∞ 𝑚𝑒 4 8 ∈ 0 2 ℎ 3 𝑐 3 these transition wavelength correspond to the wavelength of photon that be emit when electron drop down from the n th energy level to the p th energy level the 4 transition wavelength in the visible light spectrum belong to the balmer series 2 which be make up of the transition wavelength from n ≥ 3 and p 2. use a grate spectrometer it be possible to examine these spectral line and to calculate the transition wavelength from which r ∞ can be calculate use 2 calculate the rydberg constant use a grate spectrometer a show in fig 1 collimate light ray arrive at the diffraction grate and be diffract by various angle θ produce an interference pattern the path difference between neighbor ray diffract by the same angle θ be dsin θ a highlight in fig 2. the correspond phase difference due to this path difference can be found by multiply the path difference by the magnitude of the wavevector where ∆φ be the phase difference d be the slit separation θ be the diffraction angle and λ be the wavelength of the light be diffract since constructive interference occurs when the phase difference be an integer multiple of 2π this give the follow relation describe the angle that the m th order maximum in the interference pattern will occur 5 where m be the order number from this relation the transition wavelength of hydrogen can be calculate by measure the diffraction angle over various order for each transition wavelength from here r ∞ can be calculate use these value for the hydrogen transition wavelength in order to prepare the spectrometer for take measurement the schematic show in fig 1 be first setup with the grate put to one side temporarily the grate and telescope be both mount separately such that the vernier scale on the spectrometer could be use to observe rotation of both the grate and of the telescope the vernier scale have increment of arcminute before take measurement there be a series of step take to ensure that the instrument be align and focus the eyepiece be focus on the crosshair and the camera lens be focus on a distant object such a the edge of a door that be approximately 15m awaythis be do to focus the camera a far away a possible since the light ray come from the grate be collimate the eyepiece be approach from various different angle and adjust accordingly to ensure that parallax between the image and crosshair be negligible the telescope be then align with the axis of the collimator and the slit width and collimator adjust such that a clear image of the slit be focus on the eyepiece use the clamp and the vernier scale the telescope be carefully rotate by 90.0 ± 0.1° and a diffraction grate of 2001 lines/inch be insert into the holder the grate be slowly rotate until the reflect image of the slit could be see in the eyepiece which indicate that the grate be now at 45° to the incident light ray the grate be then rotate back 45 ± 0.1° and lock into place such that it be accurately set at an angle normal to the incident light ray this be important since relation 5 assumes that the light ray be diffract approach the grate at normal incidence take these step ensure that the theory represent the physical scenario a accurately a possible since the grate ruling be not parallel to the rotation axis of the telescope the image form lay above the crosshair on the eyepiece the grate screw be adjust such that the image form on the eyepiece be in the middle of the crosshair and it be checked that the image form at large angle also form on the center of the crosshair once these step be conclude the spectrometer be set up such that the light ray from the hydrogen gas lamp would be collimate hit the diffraction grate at normal incidence and then focus onto the crosshair inside the telescope for view through the eyepiece in order to get a clear an image a possible of the balmer series spectral line the main light be switch off and desk lamp dim and the door be close such that the room be a dark a possible in the give condition despite this it be only possible to get a clear image of the balmer line correspond to n 3 4 5 a show in fig 3. initially the telescope be focus on the central order 0 maximum which occur at the same location for all wavelength and this angle be record a a reference point give that each maximum have a finite width there be a random error associate with each measurement due to the fact that the crosshair be not necessarily focus exactly at the center of each maximum which be estimate to be ± 0.2° this value be obtain by examine how reproducible the measurement be for give spectral line and note that it be possible to reproduce measurement to this degree of certainty to reduce this source of random error 5 measurement be take for every angle measurement such that a mean and standard error on the mean could be obtain the maximum for each transition wavelength be then measure at various order either side of the central maximum range from order m -5 to m 5. for each set of measurement for θ the mean value and standard error on the mean be calculate use the relation 𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 𝑐𝑜 𝑠 𝜃𝑑𝜃 6 the error on the mean value for θ be translate into the correspond error on sin θ for each transition wavelength the value of θ be use to plot sin θ against m see fig 4. in fig 4 a predict use 5 the data for each transition wavelength yield a linear relationship between sin θ and the order of maximum use a least square linear fitting a compute value for the gradient of each linear fit be obtain with the gradient correspond to λ/d from 5 use a covariance matrix which take into account the error on each individual data point it be possible to also obtain an error on the output gradient from here the value of the gradient and associate error be use to compute value for each transition wavelengthsee table 1. the value for slit separation be obtain from the grate period give on the diffraction grate the grate period be 2001 lines/inch and a small estimate uncertainty of ± 5 lines/inch be add to take into account any discrepancy between the quote period and the actual period this give u a value for the slit separation of 12.69 ± 0.01μm the fractional error for the slit separation and the gradient value be add in quadrature to obtain an error for the value of each wavelength the least accurate measurement be for the n=5 transition wavelength which have an error of 0.6 in comparison to recent high precision measurement for these wavelength 1 in order to calculate r ∞ fig 5 be plot use these compute value for the transition wavelength and their associate uncertainty a show in fig 5 the data follow a linear relationship with the gradient correspond to r ∞ a be expect from 2 from a least square linear fitting that be use a value for the gradient and thus r ∞ output be calculate of 1.094 ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 with a discrepancy of 0.3 between the calculate value for r ∞ and the currently accepted value 3 there be a high level of accuracy on the calculate value for r ∞ however the final uncertainty for the value for r ∞ come out at ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 which be equal to ± 0.64 the main contribute factor to this value for the uncertainty be the finite width of each maximum observe despite appear to the human eye at the center of the crosshair each time a measurement be make the reading on the vernier scale would still vary by ± 0.2° it be attempt to reduce the effect of this random error by take 5 measurement for each maximum however this be still a relatively small sample size be the experiment to be attempt again take a large sample size for each maximum such a 20 measurement would reduce the effect of the random error and would also reduce the standard error on the mean for each value give a small uncertainty on r ∞ fig 4. sin θ plot a a function of order of maximum θ be the angle at which the m th maximum occurs mean value plot for sin θ with the overlaid linear fit be obtain use a least square linear regression error bar calculate use 6 currently accepted value have be obtain from 1 a paper present data on the spectral line from hydrogen obtain use high precision laser spectroscopy another way to reduce the uncertainty and obtain a more accurate value would be to observe more hydrogen transition wavelength the linear fitting show in fig 5 only have three data point which corresponds to a large uncertainty on the output gradient use a more powerful hydrogen gas discharge tube that produce a more intense beam and by eliminate the small source of background light such a desk lamp it should be possible to observe the n=6 hydrogen transition wavelength which do lie within the visible spectrum a 410.2 nm 1 with more data point to consider the linear fitting would output a more accurate value for r ∞ a well a a small uncertainty a key factor that affected the accuracy of the final value of r ∞ be the value for slit separation use the grate use have a period of 2001 lines/inch with an estimate error of ± 5 lines/inch since the slit separation be a constant that be directly use to obtain the wavelength value and their error a repeat of the experiment could involve an investigation into the accuracy and uncertainty of this value since this could yield more accurate value for each transition wavelength and thus a more accurate value for r ∞ lastly source of random error such a background source of light in the spectroscopy room and random error due to the finite thickness of each maximum reduce the accuracy of the final result have a more powerful telescope on the spectrometer couple with a more powerful hydrogen gas lamp would allow the slit width to be reduce whilst still be able to resolve the spectral line this would reduce the random error due to the finite thickness of each spectral line and this also could make it possible to resolve the n=6 transition wavelength which would increase the accuracy on the value for r ∞ the main aim of the experiment be to accurately measure the first few wavelength of the hydrogen balmer series and use these to calculate r ∞ and a correspond uncertainty use a grate spectrometer and a hydrogen lamp angle at which maximum of intensity occur for the n 3 4 5 transition wavelength be measure and knowledge about diffraction and interference pattern be use to calculate the correspond transition wavelength of light it be then possible to verify the relationship that bohr and rydberg have both postulate between the transition wavelength and the correspond difference in energy level relation 2 accurately described the data that be observe with the predict relationship clearly be observe in fig 5. a value for r ∞ be obtain of 1.094 ± 0.007 x 10 7 m -1 that lay within 0.3 of the currently accepted value which be a key success another key success be that through the careful track of uncertainty and their propagation throughout the calculation a realistic degree of uncertainty be achieve for each wavelength with the currently accepted value for each wavelength a show in table 1 fall within the bound of the quote uncertainty to improve the experiment it be conclude that have total control the environment that the experiment be carry out in would be beneficial such that all source of background light could be eradicate with that achieve there could be a chance of resolve the n=6 transition wavelength which would increase the quality of the linear fitting in fig 5 and thus lead to a more accurate value for r ∞ with a small uncertainty also with more time available large sample size for each data point would help to reduce the impact of the random error that occurs since the standard error on the mean reduces by a rate 1/√n n be the number of measurement take it be also conclude that the accuracy on the value for the transition wavelength and thus r ∞ will always be limited by the accuracy of the grate period so a repeat of the experiment should also include an investigation into the accuracy of the specify grate period such that a more accurate value for the slit separation and it 's uncertainty can be obtain the laboratory session serve a a demonstration of the level of accuracy that can be achieve by a spectrometer and by take a sample of measurement with careful consideration of uncertainty and error it be possible to achieve measurement of nanometer level precision use such an instrument,superficial,bal,,,
