0,GS_VJL711_Redacted,since the room be dark and it be hard to read the cramped number on the veriner the angle of diffraction could be measure imprecisely we conclude that this be the major factor that affected the inaccurate rydberg constant there could be various systematic error that affected the result we try to perfectly align the spectrometer but this could be unsuccessful also the position of the lamp should have be a close to the slit a possible since it be directly related to the intensity of the light this could make u see the cyan colour light the air pressure and humidity be also other source but we decide that they be negligible in the experiment we try to measure the rydberg constant use a hydrogen gas tube and a spectrometer and we get 𝑅 ∞ 10.5 × 10 6 ± 4.4 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 which be only 0.4 unit less than the theoretical value however we fail to obtain the precise value a our uncertainty be over 40 percent of our value and we conclude that the width of the slit be not narrow enough to produce the precise result this could be improve by repeat the experiment in a darker room with a narrower slit width and a clearer vernier a for reference this be the code that have be use for data analysis,extended,bal

3,GS_HHM124_Redacted,we initially estimate the error for each measurement base on the difference between our recording and the width of the interference line which be approximately 2 arcminute most of the error be in the range of 3 to 6 arcminute however there be some measurement be the uncertainty range do not cover the same value a the measurement on the opposite side with the opposite order number since this indicate that the error estimation have to be too small i decide to increase the error associate with the two measurement these error get large than i hop but fortunately there be at least three measurement for each colour that be quite accurate the aim of this experiment be to obtain the value of rydberg 's constant the experimental procedure be quite good because we have obtain an accurate value for the constant but there be still some possibility for improvement we should have definitely checked that we have observe the right colour since it turn out that one of the observe one be not come from hydrogen this be not a huge problem since the constant could still be derive from other colour furthermore we could have also minimize other error we could have repeat the calibration until the central interference line would be at exactly 0 degree because probably then we would have also see small difference between the measurement on opposite side the error on the distance between two slit be also probably an overestimation one way to low it would be two use light with know wavelength find it interference patter and calculate the distance between two slit with the associate uncertainty the great strength of the data analysis for this experiment in my opinion be use the sine of angle versus order number graph because it really help to low the uncertainty in the slope and consequently in the rydberg constant,expert,bal

and we do find slight drop in intensity at point which create more unce1iainty when take reading when this occuned we ensmed that the background light be remove and we remeasured the value to get an eitor from a measurement of wavelength we add the eitors in quadrature to get a set eitor of ±0.35nm for every measurement this then have to be add in quadrature to the enor which occmted due to the
