0,GS_VJL711_Redacted,where z be the atom 's atomic number ùúÄ 0 be the vacuum permittivity me be the electron 's mass and e be the charge of the electron if we divide eq 2.2 by eq 2 2.6 where v and t be potential the kinetic energy of electron respectively 5 since the energy of a photon emit by a hydrogen atom be give by the difference of two hydrogen energy level where n and m be positive integer and n be great than m. from the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a photon ùúà ùëê ùúÜ 2.9 where c be the speed of light eq 6 can be rewrite a for hydrogen atom the atomic number z be 1. therefore the rydberg constant be define a in this experiment we experimentally measure the rydberg constant if hydrogen gas be heat or electrically charge the electron in the atom be excite and the add energy push the electron to high energy orbitals when the electron fall back to their original position the add energy be re-emitted in the form of photon and the wavelength of the photon be determine by the differnece in energy between the orbitals a show in where m can be call the order number we set up the spectrometer a show in fig 3.1 use a collimator a grate and a camera with a crosshair and ensure that they be in parallel the beam of photon from the light source be diffract by the grate so we set the angular position of the camera when they be parallel a an origin and rotate it until a light fringe be observe then we measure the angle of diffraction by measure the change in angle from the origin use a vernier we repeat this with a many other fringe a possible and statisticised the result to find the rydberg constant although the rydberg constant obtain from the experiment be reasonably close to the theoretical value the uncertainty of the constant be unacceptably huge and we found that there be various reason that affected our value since the room be dark and it be hard to read the cramped number on the veriner the angle of diffraction could be measure imprecisely we conclude that this be the major factor that affected the inaccurate rydberg constant we found that the major uncertainty emerge in consequence of the wide slit size since this cause the thicker width of the light fringe this could be improve by use a narrow slit there could be various systematic error that affected the result we try to perfectly align the spectrometer but this could be unsuccessful also the position of the lamp should have be a close to the slit a possible since it be directly related to the intensity of the light this could make u see the cyan colour light the air pressure and humidity be also other source but we decide that they be negligible there be background light which be inevitably require to measure the angle of diffraction we thought this could be the reason why the cyan colour of light and the 3 rd order light fringe of red and violet light be not detect and test without any light but we still could not see the line in the experiment we try to measure the rydberg constant use a hydrogen gas tube and a spectrometer and we get ùëÖ ‚àû 10.5 √ó 10 6 ¬± 4.4 √ó 10 6 ùëö ‚àí1 which be only 0.4 unit less than the theoretical value however we fail to obtain the precise value a our uncertainty be over 40 percent of our value and we conclude that the width of the slit be not narrow enough to produce the precise result this could be improve by repeat the experiment in a darker room with a narrower slit width and a clearer vernier a for reference this be the code that have be use for data analysis,extended,bal
1,GS_GXI055_Redacted,the data that we gather from the method be summarise in table 1 and table 2 we observe the light from the licl to be red and the light from the cuso 4 to be green. this be all do in python,extended,the

3,GS_HHM124_Redacted,in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the apparatus be already assemble my lab partner and i only have to do the calibration the diffraction grate in the experiment have 300 line per millimeter by analyze the data for interference line of each colour separately one can find it wavelength by relate the found wavelength to the appropriate change in energy level it be possible to find the rydberg constant use this method it be found that the value of the constant be 1.099 √ó 10 7 ¬± 2 √ó 10 4 ùëö ‚àí1 the only great problem in this experiment be that there be probably light come from an outside source which we fail to distinguish from the hydrogen spectrum when measurement be take the main aim of this experiment be to obtain the rydberg constant while also learn how to use a grate spectrometer with the use of a spectrometer one can study the spectrum of light 1 this allows u to thereby deduce some property of luminous object or substance a grate spectrometer disperses light with a grate in which the slit be equally separate this produce an interference pattern which depends on the wavelength of the disperse light and on the distance between the several slit in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the observe interference pattern allow u to deduce the wavelength of photon which be produce by different transition between energy level in the hydrogen atom by relate the wavelength to the appropriate transition one can derive the rydberg constant and it uncertainty the grate be make of many slit which create an interference pattern for light of wavelength ÔÅ¨ the constructive interference will occur at 1 where ùõ© be the angle at which the interference line be observe d be the distance between the slit and m be the order number an integer by find several angle at which interference occurs we can therefore accurately find also the wavelength of light furthermore the mention wavelength depends on the energy of the photon which be also the energy release by an atom make a transition from one energy level to another the wavelength be related to the transition between energy level by the rydberg equation 1 where r ‚àû be rydberg 's constant n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level in our experiment we could only observe visible light which be part of the balmer series the balmer series be know to be create when atom drop down to the second energy level from any high energy level 1 hence we know that p will always be 2 for our case the n related to each wavelength will be guess by use our previous knowledge of how the colour of observe light be connect to the energy carry by photon by use 1 to find the wavelength and then substitute them into 2 while make reasonable guess of n we can therefore derive the rydberg constant the grate spectrometer we use consists of a collimator a table with a grate holder a camera and an eyepiece although we be give a function grate spectrometer my lab partner and i have to calibrate the instrument during calibration we use a sodium lamp a the light source since the hydrogen lamp overheats quickly we focus the eyepiece at a convenient view distance to minimize eye strain both my lab partner and i have to agree on the calibration since we want to take measurement independently crosschecking our data and thereby make sure that we do not make a mistake while reading the angle on the scale or align interference line with the cross wire in the eyepiece then we have to focus the camera lens on a point far away since the light from our source be collimate similar to light from a distant object this be do by point the camera across the room the object that we point it at be approximately 15 meter away and focus it in such a way that there be no parallax between the see image and the cross wire the camera have to point directly at the collimator to achieve this the camera be rotate by 90 degree so that it be at a right angle with respect to the collimator a mirror be place in the holder for the grate slight adjustment be make to position of the mirror until the reflect light be align with the cross wire this meant that the mirror be form an angle of 45 degree with both the collimator orientation and the camera orientation by rotate the camera back by 90 degree and the table with the holder by 45 degree the camera be point directly at the collimator and the grate would be perpendicular to their orientation the mention part be then clamped into position we also have to set the right height of the grate by take a quick look at the interference line we notice that the one at great angle be dimmer and be above the centre of the cross wire we use three screw in the table to adjust the height and orientation the table could be tilt because there be three screw so that the grate be not tilt and we could clearly see all the interference line when the setup be complete the sodium lamp be replace with the hydrogen lamp and we start take measurement a grate with 300 slit per mm be use in table 1 we can see all the interference line at what angle they occur and their colour we initially estimate the error for each measurement base on the difference between our recording and the width of the interference line which be approximately 2 arcminute most of the error be in the range of 3 to 6 arcminute however there be some measurement be the uncertainty range do not cover the same value a the measurement on the opposite side with the opposite order number since this indicate that the error estimation have to be too small i decide to increase the error associate with the two measurement these error get large than i hop but fortunately there be at least three measurement for each colour that be quite accurate because the wavelength be calculate from the slope of the graph the error of the wavelength be not too large since the accurate measurement determine the slope to a great extent the wavelength of each colour be determine by plot a sin Œ∏ versus order number m. the error of sin Œ∏ be obtain by use the fact that at first i plot the sin Œ∏ versus order number line for all the colour on the same graph in python fig 2 but i also want to find the uncertainty of each slope since this be rather inconvenient in python i decide to use logger pro to find the minimum and maximum slope this method be show in appendix a. from 1 we can deduce that where k be the slope of the graph for one of the colour ùúÜ be the wavelength of light of that colour and d the distance between two slit the diffraction grate use in our experiment have 300 slit per millimeter with no uncertainty state i estimate it to be 0.5 of a slit per millimeter since otherwise the grate would have a different slit per unit length number state on it 2 we can see that all the wavelength match the true value except the wavelength for green light do not but there be a slight deviation of the mean value this might be due to systematic error most noticeable be the fact that the central line be not at exactly 0 degree but at 3 arcminute this indicates that the diffraction grate be not perfectly perpendicular although the angle by which it be deviate be small this could have cause a great change in the angle at which the interference pattern occur the green colour be not even close to any of the wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum and there be also quite large deviation of the data point from the best fit line most likely cause for it occurrence be that there be another element with hydrogen in the same lamp or that it occur because of another light source i be more inclined towards the latter explanation because it also explains why the uncertainty be so large if light be not come perpendicular to the grate the pattern will not be described perfectly by 1 from the wavelength obtain in table 2 it be possible to calculate the rydberg constant since it be already explain that the green colour wavelength do not match any of the value from literature it will not be use to obtain rydberg 's constant the other three wavelength will be use and we can expect to obtain very accurate value since the wavelength be also found to be accurate the final energy level in each case be 2 since all the emission line be part of the balmer series furthermore the initial energy level for each wavelength will be guess base on the fact that the energy of a photon be inverse proportional to the wavelength for example red light have the large wavelength hence it be produce by the low energy transition where the initial energy state be 3. blue light have slightly more energy hence the initial state be 4 and in the case of purple light the initial energy state be 5. equation 2 can be rearrange to obtain the rydberg constant i decide to write down the value for the constant to 9 significant figure since they will be use together to get the final result by take the average of the three value for each colour we obtain the follow result ùëÖ ‚àû 10986233.4 ¬± 17863.9 ùëö ‚àí1 ‚âÖ 1.099 √ó 10 7 ¬± 2 √ó 10 4 ùëö ‚àí1 6 the value of the constant found in literature be ùëÖ ‚àû 10973731.6 ùëö ‚àí1 2 the obtain value for the rydberg constant have the value from literature include in it uncertainty range we can conclude that the experimental procedure be appropriate and the error estimation be reasonable the aim of this experiment be to obtain the value of rydberg 's constant the experimental procedure be quite good because we have obtain an accurate value for the constant but there be still some possibility for improvement we should have definitely checked that we have observe the right colour since it turn out that one of the observe one be not come from hydrogen this be not a huge problem since the constant could still be derive from other colour furthermore we could have also minimize other error we could have repeat the calibration until the central interference line would be at exactly 0 degree because probably then we would have also see small difference between the measurement on opposite side the error on the distance between two slit be also probably an overestimation one way to low it would be two use light with know wavelength find it interference patter and calculate the distance between two slit with the associate uncertainty the great strength of the data analysis for this experiment in my opinion be use the sine of angle versus order number graph because it really help to low the uncertainty in the slope and consequently in the rydberg constant appendix a estimate the uncertainty of slope although the determination of uncertainty of slope be of central importance i decide to put in into in the appendix because it take a large amount of space logger pro be use to determine the uncertainty in slope at first all the data point with uncertainty be plot by use the `` model '' function under the `` analyze '' tab i be able to create an arbitrary best fit line and change it slope to see what be the great and low slope that could be plot through the error bar,expert,bal
4,GS_BSS023_Redacted,our experimental result confirm the expectation of the linear relationship between the order number and the sine of the angle at which interference maximum occur a be evident from the figure below however when plot the residual obtain when we subtract the expect value from the real value a nonlinear trend be observe which point to systematic error occur in our experimental setup therefore for the red and aqua maximum we obtain the percentage error on these value be 0.28 and 0.22 for red and aqua respectively which implies high statistical accuracy derive from the large sample base and low overall random error the random error which do exist be likely due to not reading the middle of the emission line accurately statistical error could be even far reduce by systematically building an even large database of measurement,expert,the

-red -preliminary data `` red '' fit `` red '' data fig 7. graph result from first data run red emission line this be the preliminary data record use the newly developed in/out method a before there be clearly a strong correlation between the two variable the uncertainty for m 0 be due to the fact that two central emission line be visible a cyan and a red at the centre they merge but it be difficult to determine whether these emission line should be treat a one or a two slightly separate emission line for this point they be treat a one thus increase the emission line width and therefore the uncertainty in the measurement of Œ∏. these data give a wavelength of 654.7 ¬± 0.2 nm and hence n 3. a value for the rydberg constant r‚àû be calculate a 1.0997 ¬± 0.0004 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 the accepted value of r‚àû do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty this new method have successfully reduce the uncertainty in the measurement however the value calculate for r‚àû do

for m 2 this issue prevent a measurement be take these data give a wavelength of 654.0 ¬± 0.4 nm and hence n 3. a value for the rydberg constant r‚àû be calculate a 1.1009 ¬± 0.0007 √ó10 7 m ‚àí1 the accepted value of r‚àû do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty during the second run of the experiment an orange emission line be see along with the red and cyan run 2 -cyan

measurement be take these data give a wavelength of 484.6 ¬± 0.1 nm and hence n 4. a value for the rydberg constant r‚àû be calculate a 1.1006 ¬± 0.0002 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 the accepted value of r‚àû do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty line since hydrogen do not have an orange colour emission line this line be measure and a wavelength of 587.5 ¬± 0.3 nm be record the data for this line be outline in figure 10. the origin of this orange emission line be unknown perhaps it originate from some out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp due to the high temperature inside although this do seem very unlikely an experiment study the emission spectrum of nacl solution flame test have be carry out with the equipment before this data run have be carry out although this do not seem to have affected the equipment in any way two final value for the rydberg constant be calculate one for each run of the experiment but take the mean of both the calculate value and their uncertainty for the first run of the experiment a final value of 1.111 ¬± 0.006 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 be calculate and can be see plot in figure 11 a `` average run 1 '' for the second run of the experiment a final value of 1.1004¬±0.0004 √ó10 7 m ‚àí1 be calculate and can also be see plot in figure 11 a `` average run 2 '' a can be see in figure 11 the accepted value for r ‚àû do not fall within any of the range define by the calculate value and their respective uncertainty however the data collect from each run be clearly quite different run 2 -orange -definitive data `` orange '' fit `` orange '' data fig 10. graph result from first data run orange emission line this be the definitive data record use the newly developed in/out method interestingly an orange emission line be observe in the hydrogen emission spectrum there do not exist an orange emission line hence this be measure in order to record a wavelength such that this emission line could later be look up this emission line be the brightest and clearest of the three observe during the definitive data run these data give a wavelength of 587.5 ¬± 0.3 nm from a previous experiment in which the emission line of sodium be measure a 587.7 ¬± 0.4 nm use a sodium vapour lamp and 587.6 ¬± 0.4 nm use a nacl flame test -both of these measurement use the in/out method this emission line be clearly identify a sodium j. sansonetti give this emission line of sodium a 588.9950954 ¬± 0.0000015 nm 5 data from the first run be less precise and also less accurate than data from the second run furthermore the uncertainty for the measurement take in the first run be clearly large in magnitude than the uncertainty for the measurement take in the second run the reason for this be unknown however it be hypothesise that the stark difference in each data set 's accuracy be due to the alignment of the spectrometer before the data be collect during the alignment process for the first run of the experiment explain in section iii when the grate be turn by precisely 45 ‚Ä¢ such that it be meant to be at 90 ‚Ä¢ to the centre line it be clearly not this perplexed u and the alignment process be attempt again upon repeat the alignment process the grate be still not perfectly align however we attempt to continue with the experiment for the second run the same issue occur again however this time the effect be much less pronounce although the grate do not seem to be at exactly 90 ‚Ä¢ to the centre line of the collimator the hypothesis be the data from the first run be less accurate more spread out because the spectrometer be more misalign whereas the data from the second run be more accurate less spread out because the spectrometer be less misalign in this experiment the rydberg constant for hydrogen be calculate a 1.1004 ¬± 0.0004 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 use angle measurement take with a grate spectrometer a hydrogen vapour lamp be use a the light source in order to observe fig 11. all of the calculate value for the rydberg constant value from run 1 have a large spread than those from run 2. also the value from run 1 have much wider uncertainty than from run 2 run 2 use the in/out method whereas run 1 do not average mean be take of the calculate value for run 1 run 2 and for all of the value these value be also plot alongside the individual emission line calculation for reference the accepted value for r‚àû have be plot 1.09737316 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 1 the accepted value for r‚àû do not lie within any of the range define by the calculate value uncertainty the emission spectrum of hydrogen use the equipment the experiment be run twice since a novel method for determine the centre of the emission line observe be developed after the first run of the experiment be complete the data from the first run be much less accurate and precise than those of the second run and this be clearly visible in figure 11. hence a the mean of the second data run be much more precise and accurate than that of the first this be select a the final value for the rydberg constant a calculate in this experiment unusually during data collection for the second repeat of the experiment an orange emission line be observe in the emission spectrum of hydrogen there do not exist an orange colour emission line the wavelength of this emission line be measure a 587.5 ¬± 0.3 nm confirm it a originate from sodium in a previous experiment use the same equipment the wavelength of the emission line from a sodium vapour lamp be record a 587.7 ¬± 0.4 nm and the wavelength of the emission line from a flame test of a nacl solution be record a 587.6 ¬± 0.4 nm the origin of this emission line be unknown a possible explanation could be out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp although this do seem to be an unlikely scenario for this experiment a visual grate spectrometer be use to make the measurement other spectrometer design exist such a a computer-aided grate spectrometer in which the eyepiece be replace with a detector array usually a ccd or cmos sensor the benefit of use a computer-aided spectrometer over a visual grate spectrometer have already be investigate 6 in this investigation it be found that there be no significant improvement or reduction in the uncertainty of the measurement when use a computer-aided spectrometer thus this experiment would not be improve through this suggestion however if the experiment be to be repeat again much more care should be take in align the spectrometer when carry out this experiment the spectrometer do not appear perfectly align before the first data set be record before the second data set be record the spectrometer be align much more carefully however the alignment be still not perfect it be hypothesise that the misalignment of the spectrometer explains the difference in accuracy between the two separate run of the experiment in order to far reduce the error in measure the angle of the maximum in the spectrum a diffraction grate with a high number of lines/mm could have be use such that the angle separate the order of the spectrum would be large thus the uncertainty in determine the small change in the angle on the vernier scale would have be far reduce combine with the `` in/out '' method of measurement developed the uncertainty could be reduce to an even well range more repetition of the experiment could improve the final mean value take for r ‚àû a long a the spectrometer be correctly align when carry out the experiment it be important to make detailed note on the alignment procedure so that during data analysis it be possible to notice any issue that may have arisen,superficial,none
13,GS_LZH215_Redacted,the graph produce from the red spectral line be show below in figure 6,deep,the
14,GS_SZB587_Redacted,"we have use diffraction grate spectrometry to measure the wavelength of the spectral line of hydrogen and determine the rydberg constant we have found the spectral line to correspond to the balmer series with wavelength of 660¬±10 nm for the red light and 490¬± 6 nm for the green light we calculate the rydberg constant heavy nucleus in air which we found to be 1090 ¬± 10 √ó 10 4 m ‚àí1 our measurement be 0.637 off the currently accepted value of 10973731.56859 10 ¬±9 √ó 10 ‚àí10 m ‚àí1 for the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 off the calculate value of 10960797 ¬± 10 m ‚àí1 for the rydberg constant in air both accepted value be within our range of uncertainty t he rydberg constant relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of an atom during electron transition to the the number denote the energy level between which the electron transition rydberg measure this constant to be 107,921.6 cm -1 1 the rydberg be first measure experimentally by janne rydberg a a constant common to each spectral series for the hydrogen atom 1 however this constant also arises a a consequence of a fundamental quantum mechanical effect namely the quantisation of energy level of the atom by apply the quantum mechanical atomic model to the hydrogen atom and quantise it electron energy level niels bohr be able to derive the rydberg constant theoretically 2 therefore the calculation of the rydberg constant be not only of importance to spectrometry but to the verification of the quantum mechanical model of the atom propose by bohr contrary to rydberg 's initial assumption the actual value of the rydberg constant varies between element depend on the mass of their nucleus 1 however for element whose nucleus be much heavier than an electron the rydberg factor r ‚àû be approximately constant the rydberg constant for heavy atom have be measure experimentally to a high accuracy to be r ‚àû 10973731.56859 10 ¬± 9√ó10 -10 m -1 3 in this experiment we aim to measure the rydberg constant use diffraction grate spectrometry we will examine the spectral emission line of hydrogen through a grate spectrometer and consequently determine the wavelength of the emission line this will allow u to calculate a value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each wavelength we will then calculate a mean measurement of r h and use it to calculate r ‚àû we compare our measure value to curently accepted value of the rydberg constant a well a discus the condition affect the constant such a the permittivity of free space. the main apparatus use in this experiment be a grate spectrometer a hydrogen lamp be use to excite hydrogen atom in order to radiate light the grate spectrometer collimates light come from the source through the collimator and directs it through a diffraction grate each wavelength of light diffracts at a different angle thus we achieve a separation of the spectral line of hydrogen emission the angle at which the light ray be diffract be a periodic function of the wavelength a show in fig 2. the difference between the path of the light ray diffract at two adjacent slit distance d apart to the same point on a plane l away from the grate be then from fig 1 equal to r 1 ‚àí r 2 thus if the angle between the line connect the midpoint between the slit and the point on the plane of incidence be Œ∏ then if the slit separation d be small enough compare to separation of the plane l then r 2 r 1 be approximately true now a r 1 r 2 the path difference be therefore dsin Œ∏ assume d l and slit width d then Œ∏ Œ∏ which be the angular displacement between the consecutive orders. if the two light ray be to interfere constructively the path difference between them must be an integer multiple of the wavelength therefore where m be the order of maximum intensity and Œª be the wavelength plot sine of the angular displace for each order against the order number we obtain a straight line whose gradient be Œª/d and a we know the separation d we can calculate the value of Œª for each spectral line the rydberg constant be an empirical constant calculate upon analyse the spectral line series of an element such a the balmer series for hydrogen emission spectrum 5 these series take the form where Œª be the wavelength of radiation r ‚àû be the rydberg constant for heavy element and n f and n i be integer characterise the spectral line and the series respectively 6 however the rydberg constant also arises when bohr 's quantum mechanical theory of the atom 1 be apply to the hydrogen atom 2 bohr 's derivation be base upon planck 's theory of the quantisation of radiation from an atom which state that atom only radiate energy which be integer multiple of a fundamental quantity this may be mathematically write a follow where e be the radiation energy ŒΩ be it 's frequency h be planck 's constant and n be an integer multiple 8 9 bohr 's model proposes that electron can exist in stable quantise circular 2 orbit around the atom without radiate energy where the centripetal force be provide by the coulomb attraction force therefore if an electron transition from a high energy n th i orbit to a low energy n th f orbit then by consider the energy of each orbit a the sum of the potential and kinetic energy of the electron the difference in energy between the orbit ‚àÜe be then give by 3 where m e be the electron mass e be the electron charge 0 be the permittivity of free space and h be planck 's constant 10 a the difference in energy be equal to the frequency of radiation multiply by planck 's constant 8 where c be the speed of light in a vacuum and Œª be the wavelength of radiation finally we get where with r ‚àû be the rydberg constant for large nucleus a the ratio of the mass of the electron to the proton be too large compare to the accuracy of the measurement of the rydberg constant the ratio be approximately m p /m e 1836 11 the mass of the proton must be take into account when find the rydberg constant for hydrogen this be in order to account for the motion of the nucleus however all that be need to account for the difference be to replace the term m e with ¬µ where ¬µ be the reduce mass for the protonelectron system 12 where with m n be the mass of the proton or the nucleus thus our calculate value of rydberg constant becomes r h denotes the rydberg 's constant for the hydrogen atom which be in fact the value of rydberg constant we will measure from the gradient of the graph of our experiment to obtain the value of r ‚àû we use the follow equation this experiment be perform use a spectrometer and hydrogen lamp light from the hydrogen lamp be pass through a light collimator which directs the light ray through the diffraction grate and into a telescope the spectrometer 's telescope be focus use an object 5 meter away to ensure sharpness of image a sodium lamp be use to align the collimator and telescope with the slit use the telescope 's cross-hair the width of the slit be chosen a a compromise between light intensity and sharpness of image the diffraction grate be then adjust to be perpendicular to the path of light between the collimator and telescope this be do by turn the telescope by exactly 90 degree from original alignment position with a mirror instead of the diffraction grate in place the mirror be then adjust until it be at exactly 45 degree to the telescope with the image from the mirror exactly at the centre of the cross-hair the mirror be then turn by 45 degree opposite to ensure it 's perpendicular to original align line of sight the mirror be then replace with the grate and telescope be turn back to original position the orientation of the grate in the vertical plane be also adjust by adjust the height and orientation of the grate stage so that the light ray pass exactly through the centre of the grate and appear in the centre of the telescope lens this be test by check that the image do not tilt or move up or down a the telescope be rotate the adjustment be do in order to prevent the diffract light ray from deviate vertically away from the plane of the telescope lens a well a tilt of the image which would increase uncertainty in it position another reason for ensure alignment be to prevent the light ray from hit the telescope at an angle to the horizontal plane which would reduce the accuracy of our approximate model in equation 2 a number of diffraction grating with different number of slit per millimetre be try to find the optimal grate to use for our experiment for each grate the angle between the first two maximum be measure a displayed in table 1. we settle on the 300 slit per millimetre grate a a compromise between have a suitable number of maximum per degree turn while each degree turn be itself large enough in order to reduce the uncertainty a well a have large enough resolve power for each spectral line the telescope be turn in both direction to measure the angle between the initial position and the maximum of each order a show in fig 2. for each maximum the angular width of the image appear in the telescope be measure twice by my lab partner and myself and the average width calculate to determine the uncertainty in our angular measurement for each wavelength we only take 5 measurement a beyond that the light be too dim to take any more accurate measurement of the angular displacement iv result 1 wavelength of spectral line a we plot sine of the angular displacement against the order the gradient of the graph be the wavelength Œª divide by the slit width d. from fig 3 the gradient of the green line 0.148 ¬± 0.002 dimensionless the gradient of the red line 0.197 ¬± 0.003 dimensionless for each line the relationship between the gradient g and the wavelength follow the equation the width of each slit in the grate be 1/300 mm 3.33√ó10 ‚àí3 ¬± 1√ó10 ‚àí5 mm consequently the wavelength of the red light similarly the green light 's wavelength Œª green be the uncertainty in each value of sin Œ∏ in term of Œ∏ where Œ∏ be the angular displacement be give by œÉ where with œÉ Œ∏ be the angular width of each maximum in our measurement for each colour œÉ Œ∏ be approximately constant for the red light œÉ Œ∏ 4 arc minute a measure by my lab partner and myself while for the green light œÉ Œ∏ 7 and 5 arc minute with a mean value of 6 arc minute this be all take into account when compute the error on the gradient 2 arc minute be also add in order to account for uncertainty in angle measurement on both edge of the image assume the error in the slit width and the error on the angular width of each maximum be linearly independent then the error on the wavelength œÉ Œª be therefore give in term of the uncertainty in the gradient and in slit width œÉ g and œÉ d respectively through 2 rydberg constant calculation the wavelength of the light ray observe correspond more closely to the balmer series than to any other series 5 therefore n f to equal 2 while n i be 3 for red and 4 for green in equation 3 for the rydberg constant for red light n i 3 and n f 2. the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h be give by 4 use equation 3 the weight mean for r h be thus a discuss in the theoretical section to find the rydberg constant for heavy nucleus r ‚àû we use equation 11 with m e be the electron mass and m p be the proton mass the ratio m p /m e be experimentally measure to be 1836.152470 76 11 thus our calculate value of r ‚àû be with a range of therefore our value of the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom and the rydberg constant for heavy element be indistinguishable due to the high uncertainty associate with each value the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ¬± 9√ó10 ‚àí10 m ‚àí1 which fall within our uncertainty range this mean our measure value have a mean percentage error of 0.638 4 all uncertainty calculation be include in the appendix our measure range of value for the rydberg constant agrees experimentally with the currently accepted value a it fall within our range however a number of random and systematic error that our uncertainty on the value be discuss below the rydberg constant be a function of the permittivity of free space a discuss in the theory section the permittivity of free space itself varies with pressure and humidity 13 therefore the permittivity of free space in our laboratory be different to the permittivity of free space in a vacuum upon which the accepted value of the rydberg constant be base the ratio of absolute permittivity of air to permittivity of a vacuum also know a relative permittivity be currently measure to be 1.00058986 ¬± 0.00000050 14 this mean that r ‚àû in air at standard pressure and temperature be 5 this value be still within our range of expect value of r ‚àû however the mean percentage error be reduce from 0.638 to 0.547 another major source of systematic uncertainty be background light presence of background light would cause the width of the observe image to be small a the eye becomes less sensitive to light this would force u to use a large slit width in order to increase brightness of image which would produce a less sharp image with large uncertainty in position it also meant that we could obtain few data point a the image become much dimmer for maximum of order high than 3 and less than -2. this assymetry in the data in itself suggests that background light from one direction be conceal the maximum at the order of -3. it also meant that we could not make any accurate measurement of the blue spectral line with n f =5 one blue spectral be observe at an angle of about -8 degree however the line be too dim to make any accurate measurement regard it position or to find any other blue spectral line theoretically the telescope have to be focus at infinity however we could only use a 5-metre-away object for focus due to the dimension and capacity of the laboratory room this meant that the telescope may have not be perfectly focus and a defocus aberration along the optical axis of the telescope might have occur this would mean that the image be stretch out with a large uncertainty in position while all care have be take to ensure the alignment of the spectrometer a discuss in the method section small deviation from alignment would lead to light fall at a vertical angle to the telescopic lens from fig 1 the path of light would be shift vertically i.e out of the paper in the figure this mean light would travel a distance r 2 or r 1 plus some vertical distance k. the path difference Œ¥ thus becomes if k=0 this simply reduces to dsin Œ∏ for k not equal to zero the path difference approximation a dsin Œ∏ becomes less accurate if k or the vertical misalignment be comparable to the separation of the slit and the telescope the uncertainty due to this add approximate becomes significantly large our experiment be aim at measure the rydberg constant by analyse the balmer series for hydrogen use a diffraction grate spectrometer we measure the wavelength of two of the spectral colour of the series the wavelength of the red colour be measure to be 660 ¬± 10 nm while the wavelength of the green colour be measure to be 490 ¬± 6nm these value be use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom which we found to be 1090 ¬± 10 √ó 10 4 m ‚àí1 we then use bohr 's atomic model formula for rydberg 's constant and found that the difference between the rydberg constant for hydrogen and that for heavy element be small than we could detect due to the size of our uncertainty in measurement in angular displacement the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ¬± 9√ó10 ‚àí10 m ‚àí1 in a vacuum and 10960797 ¬± 11 m ‚àí1 in air thus imply a mean percentage error of 0.638 on our measurement compare to the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 compare to the rydberg constant in air we have also calculate the rydberg constant in air at standard temperature and pressure use value for rydberg constant and relative permittivity from literature 14 at 10960797 ¬±11m ‚àí1 both of these value fall within our range of uncertainty for the rydberg constant if the experiment be to be repeat the most significant improvement to be make be improve isolation from background light such a run the experiment in a dark room with no external light or cover the collimator cover the collimator with a dark cloth would prevent external light from appear with the image reduce background light would allow for the gathering of the blue spectral line data this data could then be use to determine another value for the rydberg constant and hence improve the accuracy of the mean value it would also allow for the gathering of more data point for high order which would lead to reduce uncertainty due to random error another improvement would be the use of a diffraction grate with a wider slit a it would create more maximum per angular displacement and more data point can be gather this would reduce the effect of random error however it would also reduce the resolve power of the grate and thus introduce another uncertainty in the position of the maximum a grate with 150 slit per mm could thus be a well compromise between resolve power and number of data point over the 300 slit per mm grate we use use the same type of diffraction grate spectrometry analyse the spectral line of various element could be use to verify the relationship between r ‚àû and the mass of the nucleus in order to verify bohr 's atomic model 's accuracy a state in equation 8 the uncertainty on the wavelength be give by thus for red light the uncertainty be similarly the uncertainty in the green light 's wavelength be the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h a calculate use the red light 's wavelength be give by œÉ r where 2 the uncertainty on the weight mean for the rydberg constant for hydrogen œÉ r h be give by the sum of the inverse of the error square which bohr 's model assumes that electron rotate around the hydrogen nucleus in fix

centripetal force f centripetal be supply by the coulomb attraction force and give by 12 where 0 be the permittivity of free space e be the charge of the electron or the proton and r be the radius of the orbit we then have where m e be the electron mass and v it 's velocity a the orbit be quantise the angular momentum l n of the n th orbit be therefore also quantise this mean that for each orbit the angular momentum be an integral multiple of the reduce planck constant h. therefore we have where r n be the radius of the orbit and v n be the velocity of the electron in the orbit 12 solve equation 35 and 36 for r n and v n we get and we can now use these expression to work out the total energye total the energy of the orbit be give in term of kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p

34,GS_MJV182_Redacted,this investigation involve the determination of rydberg 's constant by mean of use a grate spectrometer to measure the angular displacement of diffract spectral line from a hydrogen lamp first calculate the wavelength of these spectral line and then use the value of these wavelength to calculate value for the rydberg constant the determination by this method produce the accurate result of 1.10¬±0.04 √ó10 7 m ‚àí1 1.09¬± 0.09 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 thus it be conclude that the set of data from the red diffract spectral line produce the data with the least amount of experimental uncertainty when an electromagnetic emission be diffract whether it be from distant star or a sodium lamp the various wavelength of the emission be diffract at different angle this therefore produce a spectrum of all the wavelength present in the emission where the spectrum will be 'continuous for a solid emitter such a heat metal filament -containing a continuum of wavelength of vary intensity however in the case of electron in heat or electrically excite gas the excitement and follow relaxation of the electron between the discrete energy level of the gas atom cause the spectrum to contain only specific wavelength -those that relate to the size of the discrete energy gap that the electron transition over this be give by Œª hc e where Œª be the wavelength h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light and e be size of the discrete energy gap these be call 'emission line spectrum from the spectral pattern they produce when examine use a spectrometer a spectrometer produce this spectrum by collimate a thin sliver of light from the source use either a lens or mirror and then passing the re-sulting beam through either a grate to diffract it or a prism to refract it each wavelength in the beam will diffract or refract at a different angle thus produce a spectrum spectroscopy have be use for analysis in chemistry physic and astronomy all the way since the early 19th century when joseph von fraunhofer first use a diffraction grate to produce a spectrum of the sun 's visible light which appear a a continuous spectrum with thin dark gap in certain area these be later determine to be certain element in the sun 's corona absorb discrete wavelength of the sun 's radiation to excite their electron to high energy level thus reduce the intensity of the sun 's light at these wavelength -i.e the dark gap this investigation us a grate spectrometer the same concept a that originally developed by fraunhofer to measure the wavelength of spectral line in the balmer series emit by a hydrogen lamp these can then be use to deduce the rydberg constant a fundamental constant which relates the the spectral line of an emission spectrum to their wavelength niels bohr in his hypothesis for the model of an atom define the rydberg constant r ‚àû in term of various fundamental physical constant where m e be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light h be planck 's constant and Œ± be the fine structure constant -which be itself a combination of other fundamental constant maximum of an interference pattern occur when the phase difference between two ray be an integer multiple m of 2œÄ the phase difference can also be express a the path difference of the two ray multiply by 2œÄ Œª where Œª be the wavelength of the interfere ray 1 and since the path difference be just the slit separation d multiply by sinŒ∏ where Œ∏ be the angle of diffraction thus eliminate 2œÄ here it can be see that sinŒ∏ be directly proportionate to m call the order number thus by measure the angle that the maximum appear at and know the slit separation of the diffraction grate the wavelength of the refract light can be determine the rydberg formula relates the transition wavelength Œª of hydrogen to the integer n and p which represent the discrete energy level of the excite and relaxed state of the atom respectively the balmer series refers to the series of electron transition from an excite energy state of n 3 4 5 ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚àû to a relaxed state of p 2. the rydberg constant can then be calculate use the balmer transition wavelength value determine use the grate spectrometer the follow be a diagram of the path travel by the light in the spectrometer the emission from the source be pass through a narrow slit where a collimator convert the light into a parallel beam after then passing through the grate at normal incidence part of the diffract beam can be focus through a camera onto the center of a cross-hair x shape 1. the eyepiece lens be adjust to focus on the cross hair then the camera focus on a distant object -to imitate parallel light 2. the telescope be then set to be align with the axis of the collimator 0 ‚Ä¢ of angular displacement and the hydrogen lamp position in front of the slit so a to illuminate it 3. the focus of the collimator be adjust until the image of the slit on the cross hair be a sharp a possible and the telescope position so the slit be in alignment with the center of the cross hair 4. the grate be move through precisely 90 ‚Ä¢ and the grate place in the holder the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit be visible in the eyepiece -this indicates that the grate be at an angle of 45 ‚Ä¢ with the incident beam from the lamp and the telescope 5. the telescope be rotate through 45 ‚Ä¢ back to be in parallel with the incident beam on the grate 6. the angular displacement from this point to the diffract spectral line of red light be then record a a function of their order of magnitude the same be do for the set of diffract blue and violet spectral line from the linear regression analysis of the slope in figure 2 the standard error in the gradient of the slope be 0.000225 0.0012 0.00271 for the red blue and violet spectral line respectively these along with the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate can be use to calculate the overall error in the value

slope slope 0.000225 0.0522 0.00431 6 therefore the value determine for the rydberg constant via the 'red line data be 1.10 ¬± 0.02 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 the same process apply to the 'blue and 'violet data set give rydberg constant value of 1.10 ¬± 0.04 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 1.09 ¬± 0.09 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 these result be notably accurate the calculate error in each obtain value account for the difference between

43,GS_HSB934_Redacted,"he rydberg constant rÔÇ• relates the transition wavelength in hydrogen to the energy level between which the electron transfer this applies to all element not just hydrogen thus we can use it to predict the wavelength emit from any atom through any energy state transmission rÔÇ• can also be use therefore to determine the difference in energy state through which any electron in any atom may transfer give u the value for the energy state in that atom the theory of this behavior be described in more depth in section ii spectroscopy be use to enable the repeat observation of one beam emit from the lamp when set up correctly a spectrometer be capable of make very accurate and repeatable measurement so it be important to set it up very specifically the equipment we use consist of a collimator a diffraction grate and a telescope by passing it through a diffraction grate the light beam be split up meaning multiple order could be analyze to obtain multiple value for the wavelength a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm be employ to achieve this the beam be then pass through a telescope to enable observation far description of the working of the setup can be found in section iii to carry out the experiment we observe the emission of a hydrogen lamp a tube contain low-pressure hydrogen gas after excitation through heating or electrify for example the atom in the gas lose energy in the form of photon a an electron in an atom transfer to a low energy state it emits a photon of energy equal to the difference in energy of the two state in a sample of one element only energy level of specific value exist thus only transition of specific energy can occur the photoelectric effect then result in the production of photon of certain wavelength only spectrum produce by excite gas be observe a have emission at just a few wavelength create an 'emission line spectrum in hydrogen these 'lines be give the name the balmer series 1 in the laboratory we observe just two line of which the wavelength be give by 2 where Œª be the wavelength of the light emit and n represent the initial and p the final state of the atom in the balmer series p=2 and n=3,4,5 ... the fact that only line of two different color be observe do not prove n=5 do not exist it be possible other wavelength of non-visible light be emit by the gas or that the atom be not excite enough for the electron to occupy state n=5 far experimentation would be need to confirm this in order to obtain multiple measurement of Œª different order of the emission line spectrum be look at figure 1 illustrates how a diffraction grate disperses a beam the order of the beam m can in theory be any integer m and ÔÅ¶ the angle between the 0 th order and the m th order be related by the equation grate be usually give by the manufacturer in term of n number of line per mm d be easily found by calculate n must be multiply by 10 3 first to find how many line there be per m so that d can be in unit m. in this calculation we assume the thickness of each line be negligible by measure the angle ÔÅ¶ for several value of m and plot m against sinÔÅ¶ the gradient of the graph becomes d Œª ‚ÅÑ after multiplication by d 1 Œª ‚ÅÑ can be substitute into 1 the light from the hydrogen lamp be first to be pass through a narrow slit follow by a collimate lens to produce a very thin collimate beam and then pass through a diffraction grate the light then be to be collect by a telescope consist of a camera lens and an eyepiece a crosshair x be visible through the telescope eyepiece to help with alignment all measurement be take with the line on the centre of the crosshair figure 2 illustrates the path of the beam through the setup a choice of two grating be available in our laboratory on of 300 line per mm and one of 78.8 line per mm i originally decide to use the grate n=300 because i thought this would result in a small percentage error for d take the error would be ÔÇ±0.05 line per mm however upon look through the eyepiece it be see that there be more visible order with the use of the n=78.8 grate so it be decide that we use this one in order to have the opportunity to obtain the maximum number of measurement so that ÔÅ± could be varied the grate be mount on a rotate grate table or turntable and the telescope which be attach to the turntable could also be rotate the turntable have a vernier scale on it which show the angular position of the turntable and the telescope use this ÔÅ± be measure these property be show in figure 3. the turntable be also utilized to accurately set up the spectroscopy equipment the grate have to be at precisely 90ÔÇ∞ to the beam achieve this be challenge the vernier scale on the turntable have a resolution of a sixtieth of a degree so tiny movement in the position of the telescope and angle of the table could be make such movement be make roughly and then fine-tuned use fine adjustment screw before the telescope and turntable be clamped into place it be important not to leave the hydrogen lamp on for more than 10 minute so a not to damage it so it be temporarily replace with a sodium lamp whilst position adjustment be make firstly the telescope be position so the source could be see to be align with the crosshair at 0ÔÇ∞ to the beam it be then rotate through exactly 90ÔÇ∞ and a mirror insert into the clamp where the grate would later sit this be exactly what be demonstrate in figure 3. the rotate grate table be then adjust until the beam could be see through the eyepiece of the telescope meaning the mirror be at 45ÔÇ∞ to the beam the turntable could then be rotate through 45ÔÇ∞ in order for the mirror to be at 90ÔÇ∞ to the beam at which point it be replace with the diffraction grate the slit space must remain a control variable so the same diffraction grate be use throughout the experiment keep d constant it be difficult to perceive the line through the eyepiece at the begin of the experiment due to background light to try to minimize this problem the main light be turn off in the laboratory with each desk have it own table lamp which be switch off during observation through the eyepiece light from other desk 's experiment still present a problem so a piece of black card with a collimator-shaped hole be cut out and stuck round the collimator with blu-tac this prove very effective in block out background light once set up the equipment be left clamped in position so only the telescope could be move this kept the turntable in a fix positon ensure the grate remain at the same angle to the beam and the 0 th order emission line remain in the same position the source be then switch back to a hydrogen lamp through the eyepiece we observe emission line spectrum of two different color one blue and one red we concentrate on the set separately to find two value for the rydberg constant rÔÇ•b and rÔÇ•r respectively blue be take first the crosshair be line up with the 0 th order line which be identifiable by the fact that it be both red and blue the reading on the vernier at 0 th order ÔÅ±0 be note and then the three repeat reading of ÔÅ±m be take one by each of my lab partner and i. this be do in order to spot with a view to remove any personal bias then an average be take to minimize variation in human judgement of the reading the measurement have to be take through a magnify glass a the scale be very small and the light low the range of m be restrict by the lack of accessibility to the eyepiece at large angle and also the time we have in the laboratory it be interest to note at this point that the blue line be separate by less angle than the red which illustrate the proportionality of sinÔÅ¶ to ÔÅ¨ a predict in 2 since blue wavelength be shorter than red one after collection of the raw data average of the three repeat reading be take in order to find ÔÅ¶ for each value of m ÔÅ±0 minus ÔÅ±m be calculate after the rearrangement of 2 m be plot against sinÔÅ¶ for both blue and red light a figure 4 and figure 5 respectively which be show below in python the of the line of best for of both graph be obtain the gradient of the blue light emission graph be found to be 25.642 ÔÇ±0.650 and the red 19.173ÔÇ±0.097 the gradient of the graph be equal to d Œª ‚ÅÑ recall 3 d be calculate to be 1.269ÔÇ¥10 -5 m ÔÇ±0.06 take the error in n to be ÔÇ±0.05 line per mm the gradient of both graph be then divide by d to obtain value for 1 Œª ‚ÅÑ 1 Œª b ‚ÅÑ be found to be 2.021ÔÇ¥10 6 m -1 which be repeatable because this would give a blue wavelength ÔÅ¨b of 495nm the range of blue light be 450-495nm 3 and this figure be within the range 1 Œª r ‚ÅÑ be also repeatable since it be calculate to be 1.511ÔÇ¥10 6 m -1 which give a red wavelength ÔÅ¨r of 662nm also within the accepted range for red light 620-750nm 3 it be give that the two balmer transition have initial state n=4 and n=3 and final state p=2 2 we can use the idea that the energy of a photon be proportional to the frequency of the photon therefore inversely proportional to it wavelength to decide which color light corresponds to which energy state transition from this we can deduce that the transition from n=4 to p=2 result in the blue emission because this be the large energy state transfer and blue light have the small wavelength by elimination the red light be a result of the transition from n=3 to p=2 these value for p and n be then fill into 1 to obtain r ‚àû from observation of blue light rÔÇ•b be found to be 1.078ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 and from red rÔÇ•r 1.088ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 systematic error be then address the computer calculate uncertainty on the gradient and the percentage error in d be add in quadrature to give ÔÅ≥b of ÔÇ±0.027m -1 and ÔÅ≥r of ÔÇ±0.006m -1 the percentage error for rÔÇ•r be small only ÔÇ±0.51 whereas that of rÔÇ•b be almost five time large ÔÇ±2.5 one can see from the position of the data point relative to the line of best fit in figure 4 that this be due to the presence of more variation with blue light which lead to a great uncertainty in the gradient the gradient error at first seem large on paper there should not have be much variation in the experiment because there be not many outside factor which could affect the setup moreover the equipment have a very small resolution the vernier measure to a sixtieth of a degree meaning uncertainty in the take of the reading should have be small however the experiment be conduct in very poor light for reason mention in iii a. which result in difficulty with reading the vernier scale even with the use of a magnify glass we rely on human judgement to deduce where the scale line up exactly from the raw data you can see that my lab partner and i all thought the scale line up at slightly different reading this introduce random error the range of ÔÅ± m be only about 9ÔÇ∞ so any error in the vernier reading whilst small result in a percentage uncertainty which be large than one would automatically expect furthermore due to the calculation ÔÅ±0 minus ÔÅ±m any uncertainty the measurement for ÔÅ¶ would be double that in also the set up of the spectrometer have to be do very precisely it be possible we do not take sufficient care in do this a result of this could be that the grate be not at exactly 90ÔÇ∞ to the beam i be not sure how this would affect the scatter of the beam far investigation would be need to confirm if this could have be a source of error there be far error to consider in this experiment one of which be the fact that the line in the observe spectrum have width although we align the center of the crosshair with the line we do not account for the fact that the line have a width result in uncertainty in the position of the line and therefore in ÔÅ±m i do not have time in the laboratory to investigate the size and implication of this error so have not include it in ÔÅ≥b or ÔÅ≥r but would have do so if i have have more time the rydberg constant have the measure value 10,973,731.6m -1 2 let u compare this with our calculate value for rÔÇ• of 10,780,000m -1 ÔÇ±270,000 m -1 and 10,880,000 m -1 ÔÇ±270,000 m -1 firstly let u establish if our two figure be concurrent with each other take into account uncertainty the low rÔÇ•r could be be 1.083ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 and the high rÔÇ•b could be be 1.105ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 the two result be therefore in agreement with each other a they lie within each other 's range the measure value for rÔÇ• also lie within the range we calculate in the laboratory although it only lie within the range of the blue emission line the large rÔÇ•r could be be 1.093ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 rÔÇ•r in contrast be closer to the measure value than rÔÇ•b in the laboratory the rydberg constant have be determine to be in the range of 1.053ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 to 1.105ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 this be concurrent with the measure value of rÔÇ• which be 10,973,731.6m -1 technique involve spectroscopic equipment be employ to obtain this range overall this method work very well once in position the spectroscopy equipment be simple to use and enable u to make precise measurement also there be only three parameter to measure in this experiment ÔÅ± 0 ÔÅ± m and n. this kept the magnitude of the systematic uncertainty low have we allow more time for the experiment we could have set up the spectrometer to a more exact standard which would have reduce the uncertainty on measurement take from the telescope it would also have be useful to use a vernier scale of large size to enable easy reading and therefore less error due to human judgement if the experiment have be conduct in a separate room the main light could have be switch on for the reading of the vernier again make the scale easy to read and reduce the error use a desk that be not situate adjacent to a wall therefore allow access to all angle of the telescope would have enable u to analyze more order of the emission line spectrum give u a figure for rÔÇ• closer to the true value alternatively a diffraction grate of small n could have be use cause the order to have small angle between them therefore more order would be see in the angle range permit by our setup and more value of m analyze",superficial,bal

50,GS_GYI981_Redacted,constant for all wavelength be relatively small around 2 for each meaning the result be reliable the linear relationship between the sine of the diffraction angle and order be prove graphically for all of the colour of light produce by hydrogen so the method be successful in prove the theory need to calculate the wavelength of the diffract light to improve the experiment i would have carry out the method in a darken isolated room where only one experiment be occur at a time ensure that there be a little external source of light a possible this would have be beneficial a with external source light it be difficult to see the spectral line produce by the diffraction grate and therefore it be a challenge to align the crosshair onto the centre of the spectral line by do this the uncertainty in the alignment would have decrease and consequently the overall uncertainty in the calculate value for the rydberg constant would have be small increase the reliability of the result another way to improve the experiment would be to take repeat reading of the angle of diffraction by for example both my lab partner and i take a reading of the scale for each spectral line this way a mean value could be calculate a well a the uncertainty in the angle this experiment have verify that the experimental set-up be capable of measure to a high accuracy by use data take from the set-up to calculate a know value to an acceptable degree of accuracy with small uncertainty within which the know accepted value lie,extended,bal
