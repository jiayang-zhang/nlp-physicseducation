0,GS_VJL711_Redacted,where z be the atom 's atomic number ùúÄ 0 be the vacuum permittivity me be the electron 's mass and e be the charge of the electron if we divide eq 2.2 by eq 2 2.6 where v and t be potential the kinetic energy of electron respectively 5 since the energy of a photon emit by a hydrogen atom be give by the difference of two hydrogen energy level where n and m be positive integer and n be great than m. from the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a photon ùúà ùëê ùúÜ 2.9 where c be the speed of light eq 6 can be rewrite a for hydrogen atom the atomic number z be 1. therefore the rydberg constant be define a in this experiment we experimentally measure the rydberg constant if hydrogen gas be heat or electrically charge the electron in the atom be excite and the add energy push the electron to high energy orbitals when the electron fall back to their original position the add energy be re-emitted in the form of photon and the wavelength of the photon be determine by the differnece in energy between the orbitals a show in where m can be call the order number we set up the spectrometer a show in fig 3.1 use a collimator a grate and a camera with a crosshair and ensure that they be in parallel the beam of photon from the light source be diffract by the grate so we set the angular position of the camera when they be parallel a an origin and rotate it until a light fringe be observe then we measure the angle of diffraction by measure the change in angle from the origin use a vernier we repeat this with a many other fringe a possible and statisticised the result to find the rydberg constant although the rydberg constant obtain from the experiment be reasonably close to the theoretical value the uncertainty of the constant be unacceptably huge and we found that there be various reason that affected our value since the room be dark and it be hard to read the cramped number on the veriner the angle of diffraction could be measure imprecisely we conclude that this be the major factor that affected the inaccurate rydberg constant we found that the major uncertainty emerge in consequence of the wide slit size since this cause the thicker width of the light fringe this could be improve by use a narrow slit there could be various systematic error that affected the result we try to perfectly align the spectrometer but this could be unsuccessful also the position of the lamp should have be a close to the slit a possible since it be directly related to the intensity of the light this could make u see the cyan colour light the air pressure and humidity be also other source but we decide that they be negligible there be background light which be inevitably require to measure the angle of diffraction we thought this could be the reason why the cyan colour of light and the 3 rd order light fringe of red and violet light be not detect and test without any light but we still could not see the line in the experiment we try to measure the rydberg constant use a hydrogen gas tube and a spectrometer and we get ùëÖ ‚àû 10.5 √ó 10 6 ¬± 4.4 √ó 10 6 ùëö ‚àí1 which be only 0.4 unit less than the theoretical value however we fail to obtain the precise value a our uncertainty be over 40 percent of our value and we conclude that the width of the slit be not narrow enough to produce the precise result this could be improve by repeat the experiment in a darker room with a narrower slit width and a clearer vernier a for reference this be the code that have be use for data analysis,extended,bal
1,GS_GXI055_Redacted,the data that we gather from the method be summarise in table 1 and table 2 we observe the light from the licl to be red and the light from the cuso 4 to be green. this be all do in python,extended,the

3,GS_HHM124_Redacted,in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the apparatus be already assemble my lab partner and i only have to do the calibration the diffraction grate in the experiment have 300 line per millimeter by analyze the data for interference line of each colour separately one can find it wavelength by relate the found wavelength to the appropriate change in energy level it be possible to find the rydberg constant use this method it be found that the value of the constant be 1.099 √ó 10 7 ¬± 2 √ó 10 4 ùëö ‚àí1 the only great problem in this experiment be that there be probably light come from an outside source which we fail to distinguish from the hydrogen spectrum when measurement be take the main aim of this experiment be to obtain the rydberg constant while also learn how to use a grate spectrometer with the use of a spectrometer one can study the spectrum of light 1 this allows u to thereby deduce some property of luminous object or substance a grate spectrometer disperses light with a grate in which the slit be equally separate this produce an interference pattern which depends on the wavelength of the disperse light and on the distance between the several slit in this experiment a grate spectrometer be use to study the emission spectrum of hydrogen the observe interference pattern allow u to deduce the wavelength of photon which be produce by different transition between energy level in the hydrogen atom by relate the wavelength to the appropriate transition one can derive the rydberg constant and it uncertainty the grate be make of many slit which create an interference pattern for light of wavelength ÔÅ¨ the constructive interference will occur at 1 where ùõ© be the angle at which the interference line be observe d be the distance between the slit and m be the order number an integer by find several angle at which interference occurs we can therefore accurately find also the wavelength of light furthermore the mention wavelength depends on the energy of the photon which be also the energy release by an atom make a transition from one energy level to another the wavelength be related to the transition between energy level by the rydberg equation 1 where r ‚àû be rydberg 's constant n be the initial energy level and p be the final energy level in our experiment we could only observe visible light which be part of the balmer series the balmer series be know to be create when atom drop down to the second energy level from any high energy level 1 hence we know that p will always be 2 for our case the n related to each wavelength will be guess by use our previous knowledge of how the colour of observe light be connect to the energy carry by photon by use 1 to find the wavelength and then substitute them into 2 while make reasonable guess of n we can therefore derive the rydberg constant the grate spectrometer we use consists of a collimator a table with a grate holder a camera and an eyepiece although we be give a function grate spectrometer my lab partner and i have to calibrate the instrument during calibration we use a sodium lamp a the light source since the hydrogen lamp overheats quickly we focus the eyepiece at a convenient view distance to minimize eye strain both my lab partner and i have to agree on the calibration since we want to take measurement independently crosschecking our data and thereby make sure that we do not make a mistake while reading the angle on the scale or align interference line with the cross wire in the eyepiece then we have to focus the camera lens on a point far away since the light from our source be collimate similar to light from a distant object this be do by point the camera across the room the object that we point it at be approximately 15 meter away and focus it in such a way that there be no parallax between the see image and the cross wire the camera have to point directly at the collimator to achieve this the camera be rotate by 90 degree so that it be at a right angle with respect to the collimator a mirror be place in the holder for the grate slight adjustment be make to position of the mirror until the reflect light be align with the cross wire this meant that the mirror be form an angle of 45 degree with both the collimator orientation and the camera orientation by rotate the camera back by 90 degree and the table with the holder by 45 degree the camera be point directly at the collimator and the grate would be perpendicular to their orientation the mention part be then clamped into position we also have to set the right height of the grate by take a quick look at the interference line we notice that the one at great angle be dimmer and be above the centre of the cross wire we use three screw in the table to adjust the height and orientation the table could be tilt because there be three screw so that the grate be not tilt and we could clearly see all the interference line when the setup be complete the sodium lamp be replace with the hydrogen lamp and we start take measurement a grate with 300 slit per mm be use in table 1 we can see all the interference line at what angle they occur and their colour we initially estimate the error for each measurement base on the difference between our recording and the width of the interference line which be approximately 2 arcminute most of the error be in the range of 3 to 6 arcminute however there be some measurement be the uncertainty range do not cover the same value a the measurement on the opposite side with the opposite order number since this indicate that the error estimation have to be too small i decide to increase the error associate with the two measurement these error get large than i hop but fortunately there be at least three measurement for each colour that be quite accurate because the wavelength be calculate from the slope of the graph the error of the wavelength be not too large since the accurate measurement determine the slope to a great extent the wavelength of each colour be determine by plot a sin Œ∏ versus order number m. the error of sin Œ∏ be obtain by use the fact that at first i plot the sin Œ∏ versus order number line for all the colour on the same graph in python fig 2 but i also want to find the uncertainty of each slope since this be rather inconvenient in python i decide to use logger pro to find the minimum and maximum slope this method be show in appendix a. from 1 we can deduce that where k be the slope of the graph for one of the colour ùúÜ be the wavelength of light of that colour and d the distance between two slit the diffraction grate use in our experiment have 300 slit per millimeter with no uncertainty state i estimate it to be 0.5 of a slit per millimeter since otherwise the grate would have a different slit per unit length number state on it 2 we can see that all the wavelength match the true value except the wavelength for green light do not but there be a slight deviation of the mean value this might be due to systematic error most noticeable be the fact that the central line be not at exactly 0 degree but at 3 arcminute this indicates that the diffraction grate be not perfectly perpendicular although the angle by which it be deviate be small this could have cause a great change in the angle at which the interference pattern occur the green colour be not even close to any of the wavelength in the hydrogen emission spectrum and there be also quite large deviation of the data point from the best fit line most likely cause for it occurrence be that there be another element with hydrogen in the same lamp or that it occur because of another light source i be more inclined towards the latter explanation because it also explains why the uncertainty be so large if light be not come perpendicular to the grate the pattern will not be described perfectly by 1 from the wavelength obtain in table 2 it be possible to calculate the rydberg constant since it be already explain that the green colour wavelength do not match any of the value from literature it will not be use to obtain rydberg 's constant the other three wavelength will be use and we can expect to obtain very accurate value since the wavelength be also found to be accurate the final energy level in each case be 2 since all the emission line be part of the balmer series furthermore the initial energy level for each wavelength will be guess base on the fact that the energy of a photon be inverse proportional to the wavelength for example red light have the large wavelength hence it be produce by the low energy transition where the initial energy state be 3. blue light have slightly more energy hence the initial state be 4 and in the case of purple light the initial energy state be 5. equation 2 can be rearrange to obtain the rydberg constant i decide to write down the value for the constant to 9 significant figure since they will be use together to get the final result by take the average of the three value for each colour we obtain the follow result ùëÖ ‚àû 10986233.4 ¬± 17863.9 ùëö ‚àí1 ‚âÖ 1.099 √ó 10 7 ¬± 2 √ó 10 4 ùëö ‚àí1 6 the value of the constant found in literature be ùëÖ ‚àû 10973731.6 ùëö ‚àí1 2 the obtain value for the rydberg constant have the value from literature include in it uncertainty range we can conclude that the experimental procedure be appropriate and the error estimation be reasonable the aim of this experiment be to obtain the value of rydberg 's constant the experimental procedure be quite good because we have obtain an accurate value for the constant but there be still some possibility for improvement we should have definitely checked that we have observe the right colour since it turn out that one of the observe one be not come from hydrogen this be not a huge problem since the constant could still be derive from other colour furthermore we could have also minimize other error we could have repeat the calibration until the central interference line would be at exactly 0 degree because probably then we would have also see small difference between the measurement on opposite side the error on the distance between two slit be also probably an overestimation one way to low it would be two use light with know wavelength find it interference patter and calculate the distance between two slit with the associate uncertainty the great strength of the data analysis for this experiment in my opinion be use the sine of angle versus order number graph because it really help to low the uncertainty in the slope and consequently in the rydberg constant appendix a estimate the uncertainty of slope although the determination of uncertainty of slope be of central importance i decide to put in into in the appendix because it take a large amount of space logger pro be use to determine the uncertainty in slope at first all the data point with uncertainty be plot by use the `` model '' function under the `` analyze '' tab i be able to create an arbitrary best fit line and change it slope to see what be the great and low slope that could be plot through the error bar,expert,bal
4,GS_BSS023_Redacted,our experimental result confirm the expectation of the linear relationship between the order number and the sine of the angle at which interference maximum occur a be evident from the figure below however when plot the residual obtain when we subtract the expect value from the real value a nonlinear trend be observe which point to systematic error occur in our experimental setup therefore for the red and aqua maximum we obtain the percentage error on these value be 0.28 and 0.22 for red and aqua respectively which implies high statistical accuracy derive from the large sample base and low overall random error the random error which do exist be likely due to not reading the middle of the emission line accurately statistical error could be even far reduce by systematically building an even large database of measurement,expert,the

-red -preliminary data `` red '' fit `` red '' data fig 7. graph result from first data run red emission line this be the preliminary data record use the newly developed in/out method a before there be clearly a strong correlation between the two variable the uncertainty for m 0 be due to the fact that two central emission line be visible a cyan and a red at the centre they merge but it be difficult to determine whether these emission line should be treat a one or a two slightly separate emission line for this point they be treat a one thus increase the emission line width and therefore the uncertainty in the measurement of Œ∏. these data give a wavelength of 654.7 ¬± 0.2 nm and hence n 3. a value for the rydberg constant r‚àû be calculate a 1.0997 ¬± 0.0004 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 the accepted value of r‚àû do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty this new method have successfully reduce the uncertainty in the measurement however the value calculate for r‚àû do

for m 2 this issue prevent a measurement be take these data give a wavelength of 654.0 ¬± 0.4 nm and hence n 3. a value for the rydberg constant r‚àû be calculate a 1.1009 ¬± 0.0007 √ó10 7 m ‚àí1 the accepted value of r‚àû do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty during the second run of the experiment an orange emission line be see along with the red and cyan run 2 -cyan

measurement be take these data give a wavelength of 484.6 ¬± 0.1 nm and hence n 4. a value for the rydberg constant r‚àû be calculate a 1.1006 ¬± 0.0002 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 the accepted value of r‚àû do not lie within the range give by the estimate uncertainty line since hydrogen do not have an orange colour emission line this line be measure and a wavelength of 587.5 ¬± 0.3 nm be record the data for this line be outline in figure 10. the origin of this orange emission line be unknown perhaps it originate from some out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp due to the high temperature inside although this do seem very unlikely an experiment study the emission spectrum of nacl solution flame test have be carry out with the equipment before this data run have be carry out although this do not seem to have affected the equipment in any way two final value for the rydberg constant be calculate one for each run of the experiment but take the mean of both the calculate value and their uncertainty for the first run of the experiment a final value of 1.111 ¬± 0.006 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 be calculate and can be see plot in figure 11 a `` average run 1 '' for the second run of the experiment a final value of 1.1004¬±0.0004 √ó10 7 m ‚àí1 be calculate and can also be see plot in figure 11 a `` average run 2 '' a can be see in figure 11 the accepted value for r ‚àû do not fall within any of the range define by the calculate value and their respective uncertainty however the data collect from each run be clearly quite different run 2 -orange -definitive data `` orange '' fit `` orange '' data fig 10. graph result from first data run orange emission line this be the definitive data record use the newly developed in/out method interestingly an orange emission line be observe in the hydrogen emission spectrum there do not exist an orange emission line hence this be measure in order to record a wavelength such that this emission line could later be look up this emission line be the brightest and clearest of the three observe during the definitive data run these data give a wavelength of 587.5 ¬± 0.3 nm from a previous experiment in which the emission line of sodium be measure a 587.7 ¬± 0.4 nm use a sodium vapour lamp and 587.6 ¬± 0.4 nm use a nacl flame test -both of these measurement use the in/out method this emission line be clearly identify a sodium j. sansonetti give this emission line of sodium a 588.9950954 ¬± 0.0000015 nm 5 data from the first run be less precise and also less accurate than data from the second run furthermore the uncertainty for the measurement take in the first run be clearly large in magnitude than the uncertainty for the measurement take in the second run the reason for this be unknown however it be hypothesise that the stark difference in each data set 's accuracy be due to the alignment of the spectrometer before the data be collect during the alignment process for the first run of the experiment explain in section iii when the grate be turn by precisely 45 ‚Ä¢ such that it be meant to be at 90 ‚Ä¢ to the centre line it be clearly not this perplexed u and the alignment process be attempt again upon repeat the alignment process the grate be still not perfectly align however we attempt to continue with the experiment for the second run the same issue occur again however this time the effect be much less pronounce although the grate do not seem to be at exactly 90 ‚Ä¢ to the centre line of the collimator the hypothesis be the data from the first run be less accurate more spread out because the spectrometer be more misalign whereas the data from the second run be more accurate less spread out because the spectrometer be less misalign in this experiment the rydberg constant for hydrogen be calculate a 1.1004 ¬± 0.0004 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 use angle measurement take with a grate spectrometer a hydrogen vapour lamp be use a the light source in order to observe fig 11. all of the calculate value for the rydberg constant value from run 1 have a large spread than those from run 2. also the value from run 1 have much wider uncertainty than from run 2 run 2 use the in/out method whereas run 1 do not average mean be take of the calculate value for run 1 run 2 and for all of the value these value be also plot alongside the individual emission line calculation for reference the accepted value for r‚àû have be plot 1.09737316 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 1 the accepted value for r‚àû do not lie within any of the range define by the calculate value uncertainty the emission spectrum of hydrogen use the equipment the experiment be run twice since a novel method for determine the centre of the emission line observe be developed after the first run of the experiment be complete the data from the first run be much less accurate and precise than those of the second run and this be clearly visible in figure 11. hence a the mean of the second data run be much more precise and accurate than that of the first this be select a the final value for the rydberg constant a calculate in this experiment unusually during data collection for the second repeat of the experiment an orange emission line be observe in the emission spectrum of hydrogen there do not exist an orange colour emission line the wavelength of this emission line be measure a 587.5 ¬± 0.3 nm confirm it a originate from sodium in a previous experiment use the same equipment the wavelength of the emission line from a sodium vapour lamp be record a 587.7 ¬± 0.4 nm and the wavelength of the emission line from a flame test of a nacl solution be record a 587.6 ¬± 0.4 nm the origin of this emission line be unknown a possible explanation could be out-gassing from the wall of the hydrogen vapour lamp although this do seem to be an unlikely scenario for this experiment a visual grate spectrometer be use to make the measurement other spectrometer design exist such a a computer-aided grate spectrometer in which the eyepiece be replace with a detector array usually a ccd or cmos sensor the benefit of use a computer-aided spectrometer over a visual grate spectrometer have already be investigate 6 in this investigation it be found that there be no significant improvement or reduction in the uncertainty of the measurement when use a computer-aided spectrometer thus this experiment would not be improve through this suggestion however if the experiment be to be repeat again much more care should be take in align the spectrometer when carry out this experiment the spectrometer do not appear perfectly align before the first data set be record before the second data set be record the spectrometer be align much more carefully however the alignment be still not perfect it be hypothesise that the misalignment of the spectrometer explains the difference in accuracy between the two separate run of the experiment in order to far reduce the error in measure the angle of the maximum in the spectrum a diffraction grate with a high number of lines/mm could have be use such that the angle separate the order of the spectrum would be large thus the uncertainty in determine the small change in the angle on the vernier scale would have be far reduce combine with the `` in/out '' method of measurement developed the uncertainty could be reduce to an even well range more repetition of the experiment could improve the final mean value take for r ‚àû a long a the spectrometer be correctly align when carry out the experiment it be important to make detailed note on the alignment procedure so that during data analysis it be possible to notice any issue that may have arisen,superficial,none
13,GS_LZH215_Redacted,the graph produce from the red spectral line be show below in figure 6,deep,the
14,GS_SZB587_Redacted,"we have use diffraction grate spectrometry to measure the wavelength of the spectral line of hydrogen and determine the rydberg constant we have found the spectral line to correspond to the balmer series with wavelength of 660¬±10 nm for the red light and 490¬± 6 nm for the green light we calculate the rydberg constant heavy nucleus in air which we found to be 1090 ¬± 10 √ó 10 4 m ‚àí1 our measurement be 0.637 off the currently accepted value of 10973731.56859 10 ¬±9 √ó 10 ‚àí10 m ‚àí1 for the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 off the calculate value of 10960797 ¬± 10 m ‚àí1 for the rydberg constant in air both accepted value be within our range of uncertainty t he rydberg constant relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of an atom during electron transition to the the number denote the energy level between which the electron transition rydberg measure this constant to be 107,921.6 cm -1 1 the rydberg be first measure experimentally by janne rydberg a a constant common to each spectral series for the hydrogen atom 1 however this constant also arises a a consequence of a fundamental quantum mechanical effect namely the quantisation of energy level of the atom by apply the quantum mechanical atomic model to the hydrogen atom and quantise it electron energy level niels bohr be able to derive the rydberg constant theoretically 2 therefore the calculation of the rydberg constant be not only of importance to spectrometry but to the verification of the quantum mechanical model of the atom propose by bohr contrary to rydberg 's initial assumption the actual value of the rydberg constant varies between element depend on the mass of their nucleus 1 however for element whose nucleus be much heavier than an electron the rydberg factor r ‚àû be approximately constant the rydberg constant for heavy atom have be measure experimentally to a high accuracy to be r ‚àû 10973731.56859 10 ¬± 9√ó10 -10 m -1 3 in this experiment we aim to measure the rydberg constant use diffraction grate spectrometry we will examine the spectral emission line of hydrogen through a grate spectrometer and consequently determine the wavelength of the emission line this will allow u to calculate a value of the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h for each wavelength we will then calculate a mean measurement of r h and use it to calculate r ‚àû we compare our measure value to curently accepted value of the rydberg constant a well a discus the condition affect the constant such a the permittivity of free space. the main apparatus use in this experiment be a grate spectrometer a hydrogen lamp be use to excite hydrogen atom in order to radiate light the grate spectrometer collimates light come from the source through the collimator and directs it through a diffraction grate each wavelength of light diffracts at a different angle thus we achieve a separation of the spectral line of hydrogen emission the angle at which the light ray be diffract be a periodic function of the wavelength a show in fig 2. the difference between the path of the light ray diffract at two adjacent slit distance d apart to the same point on a plane l away from the grate be then from fig 1 equal to r 1 ‚àí r 2 thus if the angle between the line connect the midpoint between the slit and the point on the plane of incidence be Œ∏ then if the slit separation d be small enough compare to separation of the plane l then r 2 r 1 be approximately true now a r 1 r 2 the path difference be therefore dsin Œ∏ assume d l and slit width d then Œ∏ Œ∏ which be the angular displacement between the consecutive orders. if the two light ray be to interfere constructively the path difference between them must be an integer multiple of the wavelength therefore where m be the order of maximum intensity and Œª be the wavelength plot sine of the angular displace for each order against the order number we obtain a straight line whose gradient be Œª/d and a we know the separation d we can calculate the value of Œª for each spectral line the rydberg constant be an empirical constant calculate upon analyse the spectral line series of an element such a the balmer series for hydrogen emission spectrum 5 these series take the form where Œª be the wavelength of radiation r ‚àû be the rydberg constant for heavy element and n f and n i be integer characterise the spectral line and the series respectively 6 however the rydberg constant also arises when bohr 's quantum mechanical theory of the atom 1 be apply to the hydrogen atom 2 bohr 's derivation be base upon planck 's theory of the quantisation of radiation from an atom which state that atom only radiate energy which be integer multiple of a fundamental quantity this may be mathematically write a follow where e be the radiation energy ŒΩ be it 's frequency h be planck 's constant and n be an integer multiple 8 9 bohr 's model proposes that electron can exist in stable quantise circular 2 orbit around the atom without radiate energy where the centripetal force be provide by the coulomb attraction force therefore if an electron transition from a high energy n th i orbit to a low energy n th f orbit then by consider the energy of each orbit a the sum of the potential and kinetic energy of the electron the difference in energy between the orbit ‚àÜe be then give by 3 where m e be the electron mass e be the electron charge 0 be the permittivity of free space and h be planck 's constant 10 a the difference in energy be equal to the frequency of radiation multiply by planck 's constant 8 where c be the speed of light in a vacuum and Œª be the wavelength of radiation finally we get where with r ‚àû be the rydberg constant for large nucleus a the ratio of the mass of the electron to the proton be too large compare to the accuracy of the measurement of the rydberg constant the ratio be approximately m p /m e 1836 11 the mass of the proton must be take into account when find the rydberg constant for hydrogen this be in order to account for the motion of the nucleus however all that be need to account for the difference be to replace the term m e with ¬µ where ¬µ be the reduce mass for the protonelectron system 12 where with m n be the mass of the proton or the nucleus thus our calculate value of rydberg constant becomes r h denotes the rydberg 's constant for the hydrogen atom which be in fact the value of rydberg constant we will measure from the gradient of the graph of our experiment to obtain the value of r ‚àû we use the follow equation this experiment be perform use a spectrometer and hydrogen lamp light from the hydrogen lamp be pass through a light collimator which directs the light ray through the diffraction grate and into a telescope the spectrometer 's telescope be focus use an object 5 meter away to ensure sharpness of image a sodium lamp be use to align the collimator and telescope with the slit use the telescope 's cross-hair the width of the slit be chosen a a compromise between light intensity and sharpness of image the diffraction grate be then adjust to be perpendicular to the path of light between the collimator and telescope this be do by turn the telescope by exactly 90 degree from original alignment position with a mirror instead of the diffraction grate in place the mirror be then adjust until it be at exactly 45 degree to the telescope with the image from the mirror exactly at the centre of the cross-hair the mirror be then turn by 45 degree opposite to ensure it 's perpendicular to original align line of sight the mirror be then replace with the grate and telescope be turn back to original position the orientation of the grate in the vertical plane be also adjust by adjust the height and orientation of the grate stage so that the light ray pass exactly through the centre of the grate and appear in the centre of the telescope lens this be test by check that the image do not tilt or move up or down a the telescope be rotate the adjustment be do in order to prevent the diffract light ray from deviate vertically away from the plane of the telescope lens a well a tilt of the image which would increase uncertainty in it position another reason for ensure alignment be to prevent the light ray from hit the telescope at an angle to the horizontal plane which would reduce the accuracy of our approximate model in equation 2 a number of diffraction grating with different number of slit per millimetre be try to find the optimal grate to use for our experiment for each grate the angle between the first two maximum be measure a displayed in table 1. we settle on the 300 slit per millimetre grate a a compromise between have a suitable number of maximum per degree turn while each degree turn be itself large enough in order to reduce the uncertainty a well a have large enough resolve power for each spectral line the telescope be turn in both direction to measure the angle between the initial position and the maximum of each order a show in fig 2. for each maximum the angular width of the image appear in the telescope be measure twice by my lab partner and myself and the average width calculate to determine the uncertainty in our angular measurement for each wavelength we only take 5 measurement a beyond that the light be too dim to take any more accurate measurement of the angular displacement iv result 1 wavelength of spectral line a we plot sine of the angular displacement against the order the gradient of the graph be the wavelength Œª divide by the slit width d. from fig 3 the gradient of the green line 0.148 ¬± 0.002 dimensionless the gradient of the red line 0.197 ¬± 0.003 dimensionless for each line the relationship between the gradient g and the wavelength follow the equation the width of each slit in the grate be 1/300 mm 3.33√ó10 ‚àí3 ¬± 1√ó10 ‚àí5 mm consequently the wavelength of the red light similarly the green light 's wavelength Œª green be the uncertainty in each value of sin Œ∏ in term of Œ∏ where Œ∏ be the angular displacement be give by œÉ where with œÉ Œ∏ be the angular width of each maximum in our measurement for each colour œÉ Œ∏ be approximately constant for the red light œÉ Œ∏ 4 arc minute a measure by my lab partner and myself while for the green light œÉ Œ∏ 7 and 5 arc minute with a mean value of 6 arc minute this be all take into account when compute the error on the gradient 2 arc minute be also add in order to account for uncertainty in angle measurement on both edge of the image assume the error in the slit width and the error on the angular width of each maximum be linearly independent then the error on the wavelength œÉ Œª be therefore give in term of the uncertainty in the gradient and in slit width œÉ g and œÉ d respectively through 2 rydberg constant calculation the wavelength of the light ray observe correspond more closely to the balmer series than to any other series 5 therefore n f to equal 2 while n i be 3 for red and 4 for green in equation 3 for the rydberg constant for red light n i 3 and n f 2. the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h be give by 4 use equation 3 the weight mean for r h be thus a discuss in the theoretical section to find the rydberg constant for heavy nucleus r ‚àû we use equation 11 with m e be the electron mass and m p be the proton mass the ratio m p /m e be experimentally measure to be 1836.152470 76 11 thus our calculate value of r ‚àû be with a range of therefore our value of the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom and the rydberg constant for heavy element be indistinguishable due to the high uncertainty associate with each value the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ¬± 9√ó10 ‚àí10 m ‚àí1 which fall within our uncertainty range this mean our measure value have a mean percentage error of 0.638 4 all uncertainty calculation be include in the appendix our measure range of value for the rydberg constant agrees experimentally with the currently accepted value a it fall within our range however a number of random and systematic error that our uncertainty on the value be discuss below the rydberg constant be a function of the permittivity of free space a discuss in the theory section the permittivity of free space itself varies with pressure and humidity 13 therefore the permittivity of free space in our laboratory be different to the permittivity of free space in a vacuum upon which the accepted value of the rydberg constant be base the ratio of absolute permittivity of air to permittivity of a vacuum also know a relative permittivity be currently measure to be 1.00058986 ¬± 0.00000050 14 this mean that r ‚àû in air at standard pressure and temperature be 5 this value be still within our range of expect value of r ‚àû however the mean percentage error be reduce from 0.638 to 0.547 another major source of systematic uncertainty be background light presence of background light would cause the width of the observe image to be small a the eye becomes less sensitive to light this would force u to use a large slit width in order to increase brightness of image which would produce a less sharp image with large uncertainty in position it also meant that we could obtain few data point a the image become much dimmer for maximum of order high than 3 and less than -2. this assymetry in the data in itself suggests that background light from one direction be conceal the maximum at the order of -3. it also meant that we could not make any accurate measurement of the blue spectral line with n f =5 one blue spectral be observe at an angle of about -8 degree however the line be too dim to make any accurate measurement regard it position or to find any other blue spectral line theoretically the telescope have to be focus at infinity however we could only use a 5-metre-away object for focus due to the dimension and capacity of the laboratory room this meant that the telescope may have not be perfectly focus and a defocus aberration along the optical axis of the telescope might have occur this would mean that the image be stretch out with a large uncertainty in position while all care have be take to ensure the alignment of the spectrometer a discuss in the method section small deviation from alignment would lead to light fall at a vertical angle to the telescopic lens from fig 1 the path of light would be shift vertically i.e out of the paper in the figure this mean light would travel a distance r 2 or r 1 plus some vertical distance k. the path difference Œ¥ thus becomes if k=0 this simply reduces to dsin Œ∏ for k not equal to zero the path difference approximation a dsin Œ∏ becomes less accurate if k or the vertical misalignment be comparable to the separation of the slit and the telescope the uncertainty due to this add approximate becomes significantly large our experiment be aim at measure the rydberg constant by analyse the balmer series for hydrogen use a diffraction grate spectrometer we measure the wavelength of two of the spectral colour of the series the wavelength of the red colour be measure to be 660 ¬± 10 nm while the wavelength of the green colour be measure to be 490 ¬± 6nm these value be use to calculate a value for the rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom which we found to be 1090 ¬± 10 √ó 10 4 m ‚àí1 we then use bohr 's atomic model formula for rydberg 's constant and found that the difference between the rydberg constant for hydrogen and that for heavy element be small than we could detect due to the size of our uncertainty in measurement in angular displacement the currently accepted value of the rydberg constant be 10973731.56859 10 ¬± 9√ó10 ‚àí10 m ‚àí1 in a vacuum and 10960797 ¬± 11 m ‚àí1 in air thus imply a mean percentage error of 0.638 on our measurement compare to the rydberg constant in a vacuum and 0.547 compare to the rydberg constant in air we have also calculate the rydberg constant in air at standard temperature and pressure use value for rydberg constant and relative permittivity from literature 14 at 10960797 ¬±11m ‚àí1 both of these value fall within our range of uncertainty for the rydberg constant if the experiment be to be repeat the most significant improvement to be make be improve isolation from background light such a run the experiment in a dark room with no external light or cover the collimator cover the collimator with a dark cloth would prevent external light from appear with the image reduce background light would allow for the gathering of the blue spectral line data this data could then be use to determine another value for the rydberg constant and hence improve the accuracy of the mean value it would also allow for the gathering of more data point for high order which would lead to reduce uncertainty due to random error another improvement would be the use of a diffraction grate with a wider slit a it would create more maximum per angular displacement and more data point can be gather this would reduce the effect of random error however it would also reduce the resolve power of the grate and thus introduce another uncertainty in the position of the maximum a grate with 150 slit per mm could thus be a well compromise between resolve power and number of data point over the 300 slit per mm grate we use use the same type of diffraction grate spectrometry analyse the spectral line of various element could be use to verify the relationship between r ‚àû and the mass of the nucleus in order to verify bohr 's atomic model 's accuracy a state in equation 8 the uncertainty on the wavelength be give by thus for red light the uncertainty be similarly the uncertainty in the green light 's wavelength be the uncertainty in the rydberg constant for hydrogen r h a calculate use the red light 's wavelength be give by œÉ r where 2 the uncertainty on the weight mean for the rydberg constant for hydrogen œÉ r h be give by the sum of the inverse of the error square which bohr 's model assumes that electron rotate around the hydrogen nucleus in fix

centripetal force f centripetal be supply by the coulomb attraction force and give by 12 where 0 be the permittivity of free space e be the charge of the electron or the proton and r be the radius of the orbit we then have where m e be the electron mass and v it 's velocity a the orbit be quantise the angular momentum l n of the n th orbit be therefore also quantise this mean that for each orbit the angular momentum be an integral multiple of the reduce planck constant h. therefore we have where r n be the radius of the orbit and v n be the velocity of the electron in the orbit 12 solve equation 35 and 36 for r n and v n we get and we can now use these expression to work out the total energye total the energy of the orbit be give in term of kinetic energy e k and potential energy e p

34,GS_MJV182_Redacted,this investigation involve the determination of rydberg 's constant by mean of use a grate spectrometer to measure the angular displacement of diffract spectral line from a hydrogen lamp first calculate the wavelength of these spectral line and then use the value of these wavelength to calculate value for the rydberg constant the determination by this method produce the accurate result of 1.10¬±0.04 √ó10 7 m ‚àí1 1.09¬± 0.09 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 thus it be conclude that the set of data from the red diffract spectral line produce the data with the least amount of experimental uncertainty when an electromagnetic emission be diffract whether it be from distant star or a sodium lamp the various wavelength of the emission be diffract at different angle this therefore produce a spectrum of all the wavelength present in the emission where the spectrum will be 'continuous for a solid emitter such a heat metal filament -containing a continuum of wavelength of vary intensity however in the case of electron in heat or electrically excite gas the excitement and follow relaxation of the electron between the discrete energy level of the gas atom cause the spectrum to contain only specific wavelength -those that relate to the size of the discrete energy gap that the electron transition over this be give by Œª hc e where Œª be the wavelength h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light and e be size of the discrete energy gap these be call 'emission line spectrum from the spectral pattern they produce when examine use a spectrometer a spectrometer produce this spectrum by collimate a thin sliver of light from the source use either a lens or mirror and then passing the re-sulting beam through either a grate to diffract it or a prism to refract it each wavelength in the beam will diffract or refract at a different angle thus produce a spectrum spectroscopy have be use for analysis in chemistry physic and astronomy all the way since the early 19th century when joseph von fraunhofer first use a diffraction grate to produce a spectrum of the sun 's visible light which appear a a continuous spectrum with thin dark gap in certain area these be later determine to be certain element in the sun 's corona absorb discrete wavelength of the sun 's radiation to excite their electron to high energy level thus reduce the intensity of the sun 's light at these wavelength -i.e the dark gap this investigation us a grate spectrometer the same concept a that originally developed by fraunhofer to measure the wavelength of spectral line in the balmer series emit by a hydrogen lamp these can then be use to deduce the rydberg constant a fundamental constant which relates the the spectral line of an emission spectrum to their wavelength niels bohr in his hypothesis for the model of an atom define the rydberg constant r ‚àû in term of various fundamental physical constant where m e be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light h be planck 's constant and Œ± be the fine structure constant -which be itself a combination of other fundamental constant maximum of an interference pattern occur when the phase difference between two ray be an integer multiple m of 2œÄ the phase difference can also be express a the path difference of the two ray multiply by 2œÄ Œª where Œª be the wavelength of the interfere ray 1 and since the path difference be just the slit separation d multiply by sinŒ∏ where Œ∏ be the angle of diffraction thus eliminate 2œÄ here it can be see that sinŒ∏ be directly proportionate to m call the order number thus by measure the angle that the maximum appear at and know the slit separation of the diffraction grate the wavelength of the refract light can be determine the rydberg formula relates the transition wavelength Œª of hydrogen to the integer n and p which represent the discrete energy level of the excite and relaxed state of the atom respectively the balmer series refers to the series of electron transition from an excite energy state of n 3 4 5 ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚àû to a relaxed state of p 2. the rydberg constant can then be calculate use the balmer transition wavelength value determine use the grate spectrometer the follow be a diagram of the path travel by the light in the spectrometer the emission from the source be pass through a narrow slit where a collimator convert the light into a parallel beam after then passing through the grate at normal incidence part of the diffract beam can be focus through a camera onto the center of a cross-hair x shape 1. the eyepiece lens be adjust to focus on the cross hair then the camera focus on a distant object -to imitate parallel light 2. the telescope be then set to be align with the axis of the collimator 0 ‚Ä¢ of angular displacement and the hydrogen lamp position in front of the slit so a to illuminate it 3. the focus of the collimator be adjust until the image of the slit on the cross hair be a sharp a possible and the telescope position so the slit be in alignment with the center of the cross hair 4. the grate be move through precisely 90 ‚Ä¢ and the grate place in the holder the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit be visible in the eyepiece -this indicates that the grate be at an angle of 45 ‚Ä¢ with the incident beam from the lamp and the telescope 5. the telescope be rotate through 45 ‚Ä¢ back to be in parallel with the incident beam on the grate 6. the angular displacement from this point to the diffract spectral line of red light be then record a a function of their order of magnitude the same be do for the set of diffract blue and violet spectral line from the linear regression analysis of the slope in figure 2 the standard error in the gradient of the slope be 0.000225 0.0012 0.00271 for the red blue and violet spectral line respectively these along with the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate can be use to calculate the overall error in the value obtain for the rydberg constant here be an example calculation for the 'red line set of data the error in the slit separation of the diffraction grate be take a ¬±2 a state by the manufacturer thus d slope slope 0.000225 0.0522 0.00431 6 therefore the value determine for the rydberg constant via the 'red line data be 1.10 ¬± 0.02 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 the same process apply to the 'blue and 'violet data set give rydberg constant value of 1.10 ¬± 0.04 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 1.09 ¬± 0.09 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 these result be notably accurate the calculate error in each obtain value account for the difference between

43,GS_HSB934_Redacted,"he rydberg constant rÔÇ• relates the transition wavelength in hydrogen to the energy level between which the electron transfer this applies to all element not just hydrogen thus we can use it to predict the wavelength emit from any atom through any energy state transmission rÔÇ• can also be use therefore to determine the difference in energy state through which any electron in any atom may transfer give u the value for the energy state in that atom the theory of this behavior be described in more depth in section ii spectroscopy be use to enable the repeat observation of one beam emit from the lamp when set up correctly a spectrometer be capable of make very accurate and repeatable measurement so it be important to set it up very specifically the equipment we use consist of a collimator a diffraction grate and a telescope by passing it through a diffraction grate the light beam be split up meaning multiple order could be analyze to obtain multiple value for the wavelength a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm be employ to achieve this the beam be then pass through a telescope to enable observation far description of the working of the setup can be found in section iii to carry out the experiment we observe the emission of a hydrogen lamp a tube contain low-pressure hydrogen gas after excitation through heating or electrify for example the atom in the gas lose energy in the form of photon a an electron in an atom transfer to a low energy state it emits a photon of energy equal to the difference in energy of the two state in a sample of one element only energy level of specific value exist thus only transition of specific energy can occur the photoelectric effect then result in the production of photon of certain wavelength only spectrum produce by excite gas be observe a have emission at just a few wavelength create an 'emission line spectrum in hydrogen these 'lines be give the name the balmer series 1 in the laboratory we observe just two line of which the wavelength be give by 2 where Œª be the wavelength of the light emit and n represent the initial and p the final state of the atom in the balmer series p=2 and n=3,4,5 ... the fact that only line of two different color be observe do not prove n=5 do not exist it be possible other wavelength of non-visible light be emit by the gas or that the atom be not excite enough for the electron to occupy state n=5 far experimentation would be need to confirm this in order to obtain multiple measurement of Œª different order of the emission line spectrum be look at figure 1 illustrates how a diffraction grate disperses a beam the order of the beam m can in theory be any integer m and ÔÅ¶ the angle between the 0 th order and the m th order be related by the equation grate be usually give by the manufacturer in term of n number of line per mm d be easily found by calculate n must be multiply by 10 3 first to find how many line there be per m so that d can be in unit m. in this calculation we assume the thickness of each line be negligible by measure the angle ÔÅ¶ for several value of m and plot m against sinÔÅ¶ the gradient of the graph becomes d Œª ‚ÅÑ after multiplication by d 1 Œª ‚ÅÑ can be substitute into 1 the light from the hydrogen lamp be first to be pass through a narrow slit follow by a collimate lens to produce a very thin collimate beam and then pass through a diffraction grate the light then be to be collect by a telescope consist of a camera lens and an eyepiece a crosshair x be visible through the telescope eyepiece to help with alignment all measurement be take with the line on the centre of the crosshair figure 2 illustrates the path of the beam through the setup a choice of two grating be available in our laboratory on of 300 line per mm and one of 78.8 line per mm i originally decide to use the grate n=300 because i thought this would result in a small percentage error for d take the error would be ÔÇ±0.05 line per mm however upon look through the eyepiece it be see that there be more visible order with the use of the n=78.8 grate so it be decide that we use this one in order to have the opportunity to obtain the maximum number of measurement so that ÔÅ± could be varied the grate be mount on a rotate grate table or turntable and the telescope which be attach to the turntable could also be rotate the turntable have a vernier scale on it which show the angular position of the turntable and the telescope use this ÔÅ± be measure these property be show in figure 3. the turntable be also utilized to accurately set up the spectroscopy equipment the grate have to be at precisely 90ÔÇ∞ to the beam achieve this be challenge the vernier scale on the turntable have a resolution of a sixtieth of a degree so tiny movement in the position of the telescope and angle of the table could be make such movement be make roughly and then fine-tuned use fine adjustment screw before the telescope and turntable be clamped into place it be important not to leave the hydrogen lamp on for more than 10 minute so a not to damage it so it be temporarily replace with a sodium lamp whilst position adjustment be make firstly the telescope be position so the source could be see to be align with the crosshair at 0ÔÇ∞ to the beam it be then rotate through exactly 90ÔÇ∞ and a mirror insert into the clamp where the grate would later sit this be exactly what be demonstrate in figure 3. the rotate grate table be then adjust until the beam could be see through the eyepiece of the telescope meaning the mirror be at 45ÔÇ∞ to the beam the turntable could then be rotate through 45ÔÇ∞ in order for the mirror to be at 90ÔÇ∞ to the beam at which point it be replace with the diffraction grate the slit space must remain a control variable so the same diffraction grate be use throughout the experiment keep d constant it be difficult to perceive the line through the eyepiece at the begin of the experiment due to background light to try to minimize this problem the main light be turn off in the laboratory with each desk have it own table lamp which be switch off during observation through the eyepiece light from other desk 's experiment still present a problem so a piece of black card with a collimator-shaped hole be cut out and stuck round the collimator with blu-tac this prove very effective in block out background light once set up the equipment be left clamped in position so only the telescope could be move this kept the turntable in a fix positon ensure the grate remain at the same angle to the beam and the 0 th order emission line remain in the same position the source be then switch back to a hydrogen lamp through the eyepiece we observe emission line spectrum of two different color one blue and one red we concentrate on the set separately to find two value for the rydberg constant rÔÇ•b and rÔÇ•r respectively blue be take first the crosshair be line up with the 0 th order line which be identifiable by the fact that it be both red and blue the reading on the vernier at 0 th order ÔÅ±0 be note and then the three repeat reading of ÔÅ±m be take one by each of my lab partner and i. this be do in order to spot with a view to remove any personal bias then an average be take to minimize variation in human judgement of the reading the measurement have to be take through a magnify glass a the scale be very small and the light low the range of m be restrict by the lack of accessibility to the eyepiece at large angle and also the time we have in the laboratory it be interest to note at this point that the blue line be separate by less angle than the red which illustrate the proportionality of sinÔÅ¶ to ÔÅ¨ a predict in 2 since blue wavelength be shorter than red one after collection of the raw data average of the three repeat reading be take in order to find ÔÅ¶ for each value of m ÔÅ±0 minus ÔÅ±m be calculate after the rearrangement of 2 m be plot against sinÔÅ¶ for both blue and red light a figure 4 and figure 5 respectively which be show below in python the of the line of best for of both graph be obtain the gradient of the blue light emission graph be found to be 25.642 ÔÇ±0.650 and the red 19.173ÔÇ±0.097 the gradient of the graph be equal to d Œª ‚ÅÑ recall 3 d be calculate to be 1.269ÔÇ¥10 -5 m ÔÇ±0.06 take the error in n to be ÔÇ±0.05 line per mm the gradient of both graph be then divide by d to obtain value for 1 Œª ‚ÅÑ 1 Œª b ‚ÅÑ be found to be 2.021ÔÇ¥10 6 m -1 which be repeatable because this would give a blue wavelength ÔÅ¨b of 495nm the range of blue light be 450-495nm 3 and this figure be within the range 1 Œª r ‚ÅÑ be also repeatable since it be calculate to be 1.511ÔÇ¥10 6 m -1 which give a red wavelength ÔÅ¨r of 662nm also within the accepted range for red light 620-750nm 3 it be give that the two balmer transition have initial state n=4 and n=3 and final state p=2 2 we can use the idea that the energy of a photon be proportional to the frequency of the photon therefore inversely proportional to it wavelength to decide which color light corresponds to which energy state transition from this we can deduce that the transition from n=4 to p=2 result in the blue emission because this be the large energy state transfer and blue light have the small wavelength by elimination the red light be a result of the transition from n=3 to p=2 these value for p and n be then fill into 1 to obtain r ‚àû from observation of blue light rÔÇ•b be found to be 1.078ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 and from red rÔÇ•r 1.088ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 systematic error be then address the computer calculate uncertainty on the gradient and the percentage error in d be add in quadrature to give ÔÅ≥b of ÔÇ±0.027m -1 and ÔÅ≥r of ÔÇ±0.006m -1 the percentage error for rÔÇ•r be small only ÔÇ±0.51 whereas that of rÔÇ•b be almost five time large ÔÇ±2.5 one can see from the position of the data point relative to the line of best fit in figure 4 that this be due to the presence of more variation with blue light which lead to a great uncertainty in the gradient the gradient error at first seem large on paper there should not have be much variation in the experiment because there be not many outside factor which could affect the setup moreover the equipment have a very small resolution the vernier measure to a sixtieth of a degree meaning uncertainty in the take of the reading should have be small however the experiment be conduct in very poor light for reason mention in iii a. which result in difficulty with reading the vernier scale even with the use of a magnify glass we rely on human judgement to deduce where the scale line up exactly from the raw data you can see that my lab partner and i all thought the scale line up at slightly different reading this introduce random error the range of ÔÅ± m be only about 9ÔÇ∞ so any error in the vernier reading whilst small result in a percentage uncertainty which be large than one would automatically expect furthermore due to the calculation ÔÅ±0 minus ÔÅ±m any uncertainty the measurement for ÔÅ¶ would be double that in also the set up of the spectrometer have to be do very precisely it be possible we do not take sufficient care in do this a result of this could be that the grate be not at exactly 90ÔÇ∞ to the beam i be not sure how this would affect the scatter of the beam far investigation would be need to confirm if this could have be a source of error there be far error to consider in this experiment one of which be the fact that the line in the observe spectrum have width although we align the center of the crosshair with the line we do not account for the fact that the line have a width result in uncertainty in the position of the line and therefore in ÔÅ±m i do not have time in the laboratory to investigate the size and implication of this error so have not include it in ÔÅ≥b or ÔÅ≥r but would have do so if i have have more time the rydberg constant have the measure value 10,973,731.6m -1 2 let u compare this with our calculate value for rÔÇ• of 10,780,000m -1 ÔÇ±270,000 m -1 and 10,880,000 m -1 ÔÇ±270,000 m -1 firstly let u establish if our two figure be concurrent with each other take into account uncertainty the low rÔÇ•r could be be 1.083ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 and the high rÔÇ•b could be be 1.105ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 the two result be therefore in agreement with each other a they lie within each other 's range the measure value for rÔÇ• also lie within the range we calculate in the laboratory although it only lie within the range of the blue emission line the large rÔÇ•r could be be 1.093ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 rÔÇ•r in contrast be closer to the measure value than rÔÇ•b in the laboratory the rydberg constant have be determine to be in the range of 1.053ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 to 1.105ÔÇ¥10 7 m -1 this be concurrent with the measure value of rÔÇ• which be 10,973,731.6m -1 technique involve spectroscopic equipment be employ to obtain this range overall this method work very well once in position the spectroscopy equipment be simple to use and enable u to make precise measurement also there be only three parameter to measure in this experiment ÔÅ± 0 ÔÅ± m and n. this kept the magnitude of the systematic uncertainty low have we allow more time for the experiment we could have set up the spectrometer to a more exact standard which would have reduce the uncertainty on measurement take from the telescope it would also have be useful to use a vernier scale of large size to enable easy reading and therefore less error due to human judgement if the experiment have be conduct in a separate room the main light could have be switch on for the reading of the vernier again make the scale easy to read and reduce the error use a desk that be not situate adjacent to a wall therefore allow access to all angle of the telescope would have enable u to analyze more order of the emission line spectrum give u a figure for rÔÇ• closer to the true value alternatively a diffraction grate of small n could have be use cause the order to have small angle between them therefore more order would be see in the angle range permit by our setup and more value of m analyze",superficial,bal

56,GS_NHZ839_Redacted,spectroscopy be one of the most powerful tool we have at our disposal today for research and be use in many field include quantum physic and astronomy it relies on the way electro-magnetic wave interact with matter and how different wavelength may be affected this set of experiment be do to familiarise ourselves with the spectrometer a piece of equipement that allows the user to see the different wavelength compose a ray of light on the first experiment discuss in this report our goal be to determine the rydberg constant which be part of the equation describe the wavelength emit by a hydrogen atom the spectrometer be base on one basic physical phenomenon diffraction and interference when a wave go through a slit approximately a wide a the wavelength it get diffract meaning that a parallel beam will come out of the slit a a cone the interference happens when there be multiple slit or in the case of the spectrometer a grate with a large number of slit a show in figure 1 when look with a telescope at an angle Œ∏ from the grate what be see be a superposition of all the wave come from each slit in the grate a these wave originate all from the same source they be in phase at the grate and their difference of phase at the telescope depends on the difference of length of the path they be take they will interfere constructively when their path difference be a multiple of their wavelength and destructively when it be half the wavelength plus some multiple a show in figure 1 the path difference of two neighbour slit be give by d sin Œ∏ where d be the slit width in the grate the purpose of have a large number of slit be to create more discrete interference pattern and thus locate constructive interference more easily a a result of the above when a beam of wavelength Œª be pass through the grate a constructive interference occurs whenever where m be an integer which we will refer to a the order of the constructive interference a such have precise knowledge of d and Œ∏ allows you to find Œª and even more interestingly when passing a beam compose of multiple wavelength through the grate the constructive interference will occur for different Œ∏ allow u to clearly see the different ray in this experiment we look at the light emit by a hydrogen lamp unlike a common incandescent light bulb which emits a continuous spectrum of light through thermal emission a hydrogen lamp emits a discrete set of wavelength this be do by the excitation of the electron around a hydrogen atom when this electron go from a high level of energy to a low one the lose energy will be emit a a photon a the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom be quantise so be the energy of the photon that can be emit by use the formula relate the enrgy of a photon to it frequency e hŒΩ where e be the energy ŒΩ be the frequence and h be planck 's constant it be easy to see that the possible emission wavelength be also quantise these wavelength be give by where n and p be integer represent the energy level of the initial and final state of the electron r ‚àû be the rydberg constant which we want to determine on the spectrometer the user be able to rotate the grate and the telescope with good precision the angle be give by a vernier scale with spacing of 1 arcminute we first setup the telescope to focus on a distant image a it would be receive a parallel beam and align it with the collimator wich would produce the beam use the crosshair in the telescope we then want to align the grate so we rotate the telescope by exactly 90 degree and place a mirror on the grate table we then shone a light through the collimator and turn the mirror in order to have the light arrive exactly on the crosshair at this point we knew that the mirror be at a 45 degree angle so we be able to turn everything precisely back in place to have it all align 0 degree everywhere we put the narrow slit we could between the hydrogen lamp and the collimator to obtain narrow ray in the interference pattern however we be meant to see three different ray compose the light and only two appear so we have to widen the slit when we take data for the third ray in order to have a visible intensity the experiment be do in this way the hydrogen lamp emits an orange light wich be compose of three different ray one red one blue and one violet and other high wavelength ray which we could not see for each ray we turn the telescope until we found a constructive interference note the order and the angle each time this would allow u to determine each wavelength and in turn the rydberg constant 4 data analysis when do the setup we align everything properly but instead of have everything to 0 degree we have an initial offset of 180 ‚Ä¢ 7 the width of the slit in the grate be d 1.27 √ó 10 5 the raw value we obtain be in table 1. figure 2 3 and 4 show this data when the offset be take out from equation 1 the gradient give u Œª/d which then give u Œª a d be know we found value of Œª red 658 nm Œª blue 486 nm Œª v iolet 436 nm the rydberg constant can then be deduce from equation 2. for this it be give to u that the hydrogen atom always fall back to a state of p 2 and so these Œª correspond to n 3 4 and 5. we find r ‚àû 1.11 √ó 10 7 m 1 which be close to the know value 10 973 731.6 m 1 to estimate the error on the final value the error on the measurement be need first reading the vernier scale prove to be quite difficult with the tiny scale and the dim light so we take an error of ¬± 3 the ray have a width of 3 when look through the telescope so this give u an error of ¬± 1.5 the overall error on Œ∏ for the red and blue ray be hence give by ‚àö 3 2 1.5 2 ‚âà 4 ‚Ä≤ for the violet ray a we have to widen the slit in order to let in more light the width of the ray be 15 so the overall error on Œ∏ be ¬±8 ‚Ä≤ to find the error on the wavelength a the error for d the space in the grate be much small than the error on Œ∏ we only take the error on Œ∏. the error of Œª be then give by calculate it for each value of Œ∏ and then divide the mean by the square root of the number of data point a it be the mean of an error this give u œÉ Œª red ¬±10nm œÉ Œª blue ¬±10nm œÉ Œª v iolet ¬±30nm the error for 1/Œª be then give by and we then use again the same methos of the mean of an error to calculate the error on the rydberg constant give u in the end this experiment show u that the spectrometer be a quite precise instrument a we found value close to the know one the wavelength found for the hydrogen lamp be 658 nm 486 nm and 436 nm which be very close to the actual value of 656.3 486.1 and 434.0. the actual rydberg constant be within our error a we found which go to show how accurate this equipement can be when it be our first time use it and in non optimal condition extension number 2 of this set of experiment even show how we can know the composition of the sun just by look at the wavelength it emits by compare them to those of know element it be also this that have allow the scientific community to discover quantum mechanic a it be heavily involve in many pioneer experiment such a the photoelectric effect or

59,GS_BOD369_Redacted,a spectrometer be use to analyse the emission spectrum of a sample of hydrogen three spectral line be analyse and rydberg 's constant be measure to be 1.09 ¬± 0.01 √ó 10 7 m ‚àí1 furthermore it be show that the emission be most likely those of the balmer series produce by electron fall to the n=2 state from high energy level a second experiment be also conduct in which a spectrum be produce by a white lead nichia 713-3955 a continuous spectrum be observe and image take in order to discern how the lead produce this and the nature of the spectrum t he most simple quantise model of the atom be the bohr model of hydrogen in which a single electron be consider to orbit a proton bound entirely by the coulomb force 1 in this model we consider the quantise nature of electron energy level such that only distinct and discrete wavelength of electromagnetic radiation can be absorbed or emit by an atom these wavelength be unique to a particular atom or molecule and can therefore be use to identify matter present in object such a star or mixture of gas and theirs property in this way spectrometry can be use to study fundamental interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter in a similar way to in atom led function by the stimulate movement of electron between artificial energy level within the led structure such that the electron emit photon 2 thus information on structure of an lead could be discern by perform spectrometry on it emission spectrum figure 1 show how light diffracts through a diffraction grate where the path difference between adjacent beam to any point on the screen be give by dsin Œ∏ where d be the distance between adjacent slit and Œ∏ be the angle subtend by a diffract ray and the displacement between the grate and the screen for the wave to interfere constructively this path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength Œª thus we find the relation where n be the order of the maximum an experimental set up like that in figure 2 be use circle graduate in degree with a minimum angular resolution of 1 arcminute the spectrometer be calibrate by set the telescope cross-hair directly on the open slit with a test bright light source behind it before insert the grate the telescope be rotate at 90 ‚Ä¢ to the collimator a mirror be insert into the grate turntable and rotate so that light be reflect from the collimator into the telescope at this point the mirror be at 45 ‚Ä¢ to the light beam the mirror be then replace with the diffraction grate and rotate 45 ‚Ä¢ to make it perpendicular to the collimator the telescope be then rotate 90 ‚Ä¢ back to face the collimator the diffraction grate use have 300 line per millimetre a this be the only grate which allow the m red ¬±2 and m violet ¬±3 maximum to be easily distinguish but still provide enough visible order such that a mean and error could be calculate measurement be take anticlockwise from the high order maximum on the left to that on the right in order to avoid any mechanical inconsistency that my be present in the device if the direction of rotation be alternate the high order maximum that could be see clearly be m blue 3 and m blue ‚àí3 with angle from the central maximum of 25.93 ‚Ä¢ and ‚àí25.08 ‚Ä¢ respectively in order to maximise precision the slit be close until the maximum furthest from the centre be just visible this meant that the cross-hair be always centre on the fringe reduce the error in the fringe 's position and that adjacent fringe would be less likely to interfere or obscure each other the high order maximum for the red emission line be 2 and -2 a any high order maximum be likely too dim with the slit at a width small enough to provide adequate precision the measure result can be see in table i where the error be determine a the minimum resolution of the spectrometer 1 arcminute instead of half that a the measurement depend on an initial measurement of the location of the central maximum a can be see the angle be symmetric around the central maximum but all positive order of maximum have angle away from the centre that be large than their negative counterpart this would seem to imply that the diffraction grate be not set up perfectly perpendicular to the incident light beam alternatively the actual position of the central maximum could have be measure inaccurately however this seem less likely a the inconsistency be a high a 0.32 ‚Ä¢ an order of magnitude large than the resolution of the device in the case of m blue ¬±1 the average wavelength associate with the angle in table i can be see in table ii error be calculate use equation 2 where œÉ m be the standard error on the mean s be the standard deviation of the value use to calculate the mean and x be the number of value use to calculate the mean the measure wavelength mostly align with those measure for the balmer series of hydrogen emission line on the order of 655nm for red 485nm for blue and 433nm for violet 3 there be a noticeable difference of around 10nm between the measure violet wavelength and the accepted one it could be that whatever error present in the set up which cause the asymmetry in table i be intensified at small wavelength a small difference in slit width and angle will have a large contribution to this small value of Œª. the similarity between our measurement and those of the balmer series implies that electron be fall to the n= 2 electron quantum state from the bohr model of the hydrogen atom we find where r h be the rydberg constant for hydrogen n be the low energy electron quantum number and p be the high energy electron quantum number the full derivation of this can be found in appendix a 1 it be interest to note that this equation only describes atom or ion with a single electron a multiple electron will interact with each other however for nucleus with more than one proton the rydberg constant will have a different value scale by the increase in charge of the nucleus a it have be establish that the measure wavelength be most like those of the balmer series then n 2 and p 3 4 5 for the red blue and violet emission line respectively note that the energy level of the emission line must be consecutive else other emission line would be see furthermore a the the energy of the photon be described by where h be planck 's constant and c be the speed of light a large difference in energy level corresponds to a small wavelength Œª. for each of the wavelength an average value of r h be calculate and can be see in table iii this give an average value of r h of 1.09¬±0.01√ó10 7 with all error calculate use equation 2. the accepted value for r h be 1.10 √ó 10 7 therefore our measure value be in concurrence with this 3 it may be of interest to compare this data to different assumption of the n electron energy level a such the possibility must be consider that n could be high or low than n 2. a can be see the assumption of the n 3 or n 4 state produce line that be quite clearly not horizontal have gradient an order of magnitude large than that of n 1 or n 2. from comparison with other measure value of the balmer series n 2 it be clear that the measure wavelength be those of the balmer series however this be not necessarily clear from the figure 4 a n 1 and n 2 have gradient of similar order of magnitude although the gradient for n 2 be indeed closer to 0 it be not significantly closer furthermore the error in n 1 be significant compare to it value around 35 this be likely due to the afore mention deviation of the violet emission line wavelength form it expect value a such more data would be require to prove that electron be fall to the n 2 state a set up like that in the previous experiment be use see fig 2 with the 300 line per millimetre diffraction grate replace with a 100 line per millimetre grate and a camera use to take image through the eyepiece 4 this be do to allow the entire spectrum to be visible at once a see through the eyepiece so that it could then be photograph and the intensity across wavelength plot a nichia model 713-3955 white lead be use in place of the hydrogen lamp a scan 90 ‚Ä¢ clockwise and anticlockwise from the central maximum be make to give a qualitative understand of the diffraction pattern interestingly it be observe that the spectrum of the lead be entirely continuous this can be see in figure 5 with no clear vertical line correspond to specific emission line this be entirely contradictory to the idea that this lead work use artificial energy level within the material alone to generate light a a set of energy level span a range must be produce such that the difference in energy between subsequent energy level be small enough to produce a spectrum that appear continuous furthermore each energy level will have a different threshold voltage meaning that one could activate only low energy emission of red light with a sufficiently low voltage this however be not observe and the lead turn on sharply at 2.66 ¬± 0.005v a such it seem reasonable to assume that the lead itself produce a high energy wavelength for example ultraviolet and this be absorbed by a phosphor coat and re-emitted in the visible range horizontal line can be observe on the spectrum however this be determine to be cause by dust within the slit on the collimator block some of the incident light a far issue exist in that order of maximum high than the first order be see to overlap fig 5. two image be take of the spectrum with the camera centre on the blue region and the red region respectively this be do to hopefully remove some of the camera 's bias towards certain colour or object in certain position the angle away from the central maximum of the red and blue boundary can be see in table v and the intensity plot of each can be see in figure 6 and 7. interestingly it can be see that there be clear saturation of the detect intensity between a distance of 300 and 500 pixel on both figure 6 and 7. the wavelength in this interval correspond to the range 470nm to 520nm this fact alone implies that this camera be unsuitable for this purpose a either the detector or some aspect of it internal processing contains a bias towards certain wavelength in the visible a such in order to conduct this aspect of the experiment effectively an unbiased camera must be found and utilised in this paper a spectrometer be use to analyse the spectrum emit by a hydrogen lamp and a nichia 713-3955 white lead in order to discern a deeper understand of the structure present in each source first the spectrum of hydrogen be analyse and be found to contain three distinct emission line red blue and violet with respective wavelength of 652 ¬± 3nm 482 ¬± 11nm and 449 ¬± 3nm it be found that these wavelength be most similar to those of the hydrogen balmer series with the only measurement deviate from the accepted value be that of the violet measurement this deviation be likely due to asymmetry cause by error in calibration however far data should be take to confirm this from these wavelength measurement the average of rydberg 's constant be calculate to be 1.09 ¬± 0.01 √ó 10 7 with the accepted value value be 1.10 ¬± 0.01 √ó 10 7 3 far analysis be conduct under the assumption that the emission line see be not those of the balmer series figure 4 and table iv provide the predict value of r h associate with an emission line for a possible value of n. a rydberg 's constant should be the same for all wavelength the gradient of the line should be 0. it be found that the assumption of the n 3 or n 4 state produce line that be quite clearly not horizontal have gradient an order of magnitude large than that of n 1 or n 2. from the calculate gradient table iv it can be see that n 1 and n 2 produce gradient on the same order of magnitude a such more data would have to be collect in order to verify that this be the balmer series the lead spectrum be analyse and qualitatively it be notice that the observe spectrum be continuous contradict the expectation that the lead produce light in a way similar to that of other led by stimulate movement of electron between distinct energy level a the difference in energy between consecutive energy level would have to be small enough such that it could not be notice this seem like an unlikely design instead it seem more reasonable that the lead be cover by a phosphor coat which absorbs a small set of high energy wavelength and emits a continuous spectrum in the visible an attempt at a more quantitative analysis of the spectrum be make use image take on the camera of an iphone 7 however on far inspection of the data fig 6 and 7 it be see that the camera or processing within the device contain clear bias towards certain wavelength make the data fundamentally untrustworthy for this aspect of the experiment to be conduct successfully it would be necessary to utilise an entirely unbiased light photo-detector or camera mount to the spectrometer telescope to maximise stability the rydberg equation be where r h be the rydberg constant n be the low energy electron quantum number and p be the high energy electron quantum state to derive this we imagine a hydrogen atom in which a single electron be in a circular orbit of radius r of a single proton the total energy e held by the electron can be represent by the sum of it potential and kinetic energy a the only significant potential be electric potential then where e be the magnitude of the charge of the electron k be the coulomb constant m be the mass of the electron v be the electron 's velocity and r be the distance between the proton and the electron next we consider the electron to be orbit the proton thus the centripetal force f c be described by from this we find for the energy of a photon release from an electron move from energy level f=p to energy level f=n where p¬øn and n and p be integer then therefore where mek 2 e 4 4œÄh 3 r h be the

fundamental constant the most general formulation of the relationship be first publish in 1888 by johannes rydberg a swedish physicist who start his career a an amanuensis the theoretical justification of his work be provide in 1913 by niels bohr who propose a model of the atom with electron orbit around the nucleus on quantise energy level 3 bohr 's work show that rydberg 's formula relates the fundamental quantum number of the energy level from and to which an orbit electron drop emit energy in the form of light and the wavelength of the light emit 3 the aim of this experiment be to measure rydberg 's constant use a grate spectrometer we use a hydrogen gasdischarge lamp a a source of light and register the angular position of the light fringe use an optical spectrometer from these measurement we be able to calculate the wavelength of the different colour of the fringe and therefore obtain a value for the rydberg 's constant a diffraction grate have equally space slit that be parallel and identical to each other and give an interference pattern with very narrow maximum this enables more precise measurement of the angular position of the maximum than could be obtain use a setup with few slit a series of fringe call balmer series can be observe with a spectrometer if a hydrogen lamp be place in front of it grate the band of each colour correspond to the maximum of the diffraction pattern and repeat several time at different angular position identify by an order number m a show in fig 1. the order number the angle Œ∏ relative to the position 0 th order at which a fringe can be found and the wavelength of the colour observe be related through the path difference 2 for light of wavelength Œª a phase difference between neighbour ray of integer multiple of 2œÄ

fig 2. a diagram show the difference in path length Œ¥x between two adjacent ray this distance be equal to dsinŒ∏ where d be the slit separation and Œ∏ be the grate angle a different expression for the wavelength be give by an empirical formula found by the swiss physicist johann balmer in 1855 later generalise by rydberg 5 the more general formulation be where r‚àû be the rydberg constant n and p be integer and represent respectively the energy level of the initial and final state of the electron that emits the light the rydberg constant can be express use fundamental constant by look at the energy of the photon that result from the transition of an electron between different energy level in the hydrogen atom a described by bohr 's model the energy of this photon be in absolute value equal to the difference Œ¥e in internal energy of the two energy level involve and can be express use einstein 's light quantisation a where h be the planck constant and c be the speed of light in vacuum 6 the difference in internal energy can also be express in term of the energy of initial and final energy level the energy of these state can be write a the sum of their potential energy pe and kinetic energy ke and where e be the charge of the electron r be the radius of the atomic orbit me be the mass of the electron and v be it velocity 5 substitute bohr 's radius and the speed of the orbit electron see equation 11 and 12 in appendix into equation 6 the energy can be express a where n represent the initial energy level similarly the same result can be found for the final energy with p represent the final energy level the difference in internal energy can now be write a equate equation 5 and 10 rydberg 's formula can be write a therefore the rydberg 's constant can be write a the set-up of the spectrometer use in this experiment be show in fig 3. after focus the eyepiece on the crosswire at roughly 30 centimetre to avoid eye strain we focus the camera lens of the optical spectrometer on an object distant nearly 10 metre which be a good approximation of focus on infinity we then position the lamp close to the slit to adjust the focus of the collimator and clamped the telescope at 90¬∞ to be able to put the grate at exactly 45¬∞ use a mirror for this experiment we use a diffraction grate with 300 slit to minimise systematic error we make sure that all the component be well align use a sodium lamp that unlike the hydrogen lamp do not need to be turn off often to avoid overheat to be able to see the spectrum clearly we kept our desk lamp off for the entire duration of the experiment for the experiment we use a hydrogen gas-discharge lamp a the source of light we turn it off between measurement to avoid overheat we first measure the width of the central maximum a a reference value for the width of the spectral line to be approximately 4 we then take two measurement of angular position relative to the central maximum for each colour band we be able to see position the crosswire approximately on the centre of the fringe the error on these reading due to the difficulty to clearly identify the centre of very dim fringe be estimate to be 1 the error on the reading on the vernier scale of the spectrometer be of 1 we plot the sine of the measure angular position against the order number of the fringe for each of the colour observe red blue and violet we verify that for every colour the relationship between the two variable follow the linear correlation expect a show if fig 4. we be able to see three order of line for the red and blue light but only two for the violet one the three line meet in a common point that corresponds to the central maximum namely the 0 th order the error on the fit line for the three colour show in fig 3 be express in table 1. the error on the single data point be calculate consider the error on the reading on the vernier scale and the estimate error on the position of the centre of the fringe these error on the fitting line be calculate use the covariance matrix use equation 3 in the form where d be the separation between two consecutive slit and we calculate wavelength for the three set of line observe the value obtain for the wavelength and the correspond fundamental quantum number of the initial energy level be set out in table 2. the value for the fundamental quantum number n represent the initial energy level be obtain from the know value correspond to the wavelength measure 1 use equation 4 we calculate a value for the rydberg constant for each of the colour know that the fundamental quantum number p correspond to the energy level to which the electron drop be 2 for the three case 1 take the average of the three value calculate for the constant we obtain our final result of 1.099‚Ä¢10 7 m -1 with an error of 3‚Ä¢10 4 m -1 this error arises from the error calculate on the three individual value that depend on the limitation of the equipment our ability to identify the centre of the line and on the precision of the fit function all the error be determine use the standard formula of error analysis 8 this report review the process involve in calculate rydberg 's constant with small systematic error observe with a spectrometer the spectral line generate by a hydrogen lamp and measure their angular position relative to the central maximum plot these measurement against the order number of the colour band we obtain a value for the wavelength of the different colour use the wavelength value we be able to determine the fundamental quantum number of the orbital involve in the emission of light by compare our result with the know value for the hydrogen atom energy level finally we use rydberg 's formula and obtain a mean value of 1.099‚Ä¢10 7 m -1 for the rydberg constant this result agrees with the accepted value of 1.097‚Ä¢10 7 m -1 1 which lie within our error range to minimise systematic error the alignment of the component of the equipment be carefully set up and the influence of background illumination reduce a much a possible a it cause the line to be difficult to observe other possible source of error we identify be the dimness of high order spectral line

can also be express a r √∏mc 2h where √∏ be the fine structure constant a dimensionless quantity 6 m be the mass of an electron c be the speed of light and h be plank 's constant another important piece of theory to consider be the balmer series the balmer series be a series of line from the hydrogen emission spectrum cause by electron fall from the nth energy level to the principle quantum number 2 7 for instance the transition from energy level 3 to energy level 2 will appear red on the em spectrum 4- 2 will appear cyan in colour and transition 5- 2 will appear blue 8 use the balmer series therefore allows u to optically record and measure the diffraction scatter a 4 of the transition of n appear in the visible spectrum figure 2 illustrates different type of emission and absorption series include the balmer series it be clear to see that those transition in the lyman series will need considerably more energy to be able to transition to the other n band all the line in the lyman series be in the ultraviolet band and thus be not suitable for our investigation 10 the other series adjacent to the balmer series be the paschen series these transition will have less energy than the balmer transition and thus all the paschen line lie in the infrared band 11 a you move through the series the rate at which the wavelength increase decrease until you reach the convergence limit of the series this be in effect the energy need to ionize the hydrogen atom the figure below illustrates the most important part of the set up two type of discharge lamp be use in this investigation be compose of hydrogen and sodium the sodium lamp be use for the calibration of the spectrometer whereas the hydrogen lamp be use for the actual recording the sodium lamp initially emit lilac light and then turn to an orange colour the hydrogen lamp use in this experiment produce a lot of heat which would significantly affect the operation time thus the hydrogen lamp be only use for the recording whereas the sodium lamp could operate for long period of time this become one of the key consideration a all measurement would have to be take before the lamp overheat this would require an efficient way of record result after the source we have the slit ideally the slit should be a narrow a possible to make the angle measurement a precise a possible another part of the fix spectrometer be the collimator a collimator essentially produce a beam of parallel ray which be useful for when you want the wave to converge on the same focal point the grate use in this investigation have 300 line per mm the logic behind use a diffraction grate with more slit be the fact that these extra slit would reinforce the diffraction pattern make them more visible especially at the high order 13 the set up of the spectrometer be a lengthy one however this get easy over time the set up begin with the focus of the eyepiece on the crosswire this be do from about 5 meter ideally this should be do from an infinite distance 14 in this case a lamp on the other desk be focus on one consideration be to keep both eye open whilst focus the camera now the telescope have to be align with the axis of the collimator this could be do by very slightly opening the slit with the sodium lamp fully lit behind it now once the collimator be perfectly align with the telescope use the slow-motion drive on the side of the spectrometer stage the collimator be focus until a sharp image appear the cross wire be rotate by œÄ 4 to ensue that the alignment of the stage could be a precise a possible carefully record the angle at which the main stage be rotate and the angle present on the two main scale be an essential part of the experiment a precision be require the main stage be initially move to an angle of 59.5 degree and 2 arc minute two arc minute be the equivalent of .03 of a degree it become essential to be able to quickly convert these reading of arc minute into the more useful degree now the telescope have to be move through exactly 90 degree it be very helpful to get a second opinion on the angle measurement and reach a consensus then the grate table be turn until a reflect image of the slit on the grate come from the collimator be see this should be at 45 degree to the normal of the spectrometer additionally the use of a mirror to double check the reflection from the collimator prove very useful the reading on the scale must be take down in the case of our set up the reading come out a 68 degree and 20 arc minute now the grate stage must be firmly fix to the main fine motor and this whole set up be move through 45 degree so that the grate be at the normal incidence when the grate stage be in place the grate stage can be move by turn 3 different screw which adjust the height of the main stage to ensure that when move through the angle of 6 figure 2 9 figure 3 12 observation all spectral line can be observe this can be checked by simply observe the spectral line through large angle of incidence and adjust appropriately in a more practical sense the stage be control by 3 screw a it be the most stable configuration a mathematically 3 point determine a plane so any more or less than this would be much less stable 15 when the camera and eye piece be move to the zero order the angular scale read 203 degree and 10 arc minute now the sodium lamp could be replace by the hydrogen lamp and data be record a range of 4 th to -4 th order be measure a a large spread of data would give the best possible set of data in addition to this a second opinion be always utilized a this would give a value of uncertainty value for 3 discrete wavelength emission be record and with these a graph of sinŒ∏ against order be plot from the gradient of this straight line plot a value for Œª can be obtain the error bar on these graph come from the difference in the two measurement take of the same emission line an error of the gradient can also be show on python with this information and the understand of which wavelength be cause by which transmission the value obtain can be substitute into equation 5 with n1=2 to find the rydberg constant error bar be very small with only reading from the -2 nd 1 st and 2 nd order have an associate error this mean that both measurement from two different people be the same for most record result with this transition the uncertainty of the slope be slightly high than expect due to a minor spread in result at the -1 st and 3 rd order the straight line be expect to pas through the origin and the fact that the error do not cover the actual intercept record must mean an unknown source of error the uncertainty in the slope be considerably small than transition 3 to 2 and simply from observation all the point lie very close to the line once again the line almost pass through the origin and lie outside of the calculate error error bar on this graph be large for order -3 -1 and 2. uncertainty for the slope be even high than for the transition from 3 to 2. the most obvious thing about this plot be the fact that only +/-2 order be measure this be because the intensity of these order be too low to be measure use the human eye also notice that the error bar increase in size a the order increase this could be due to the change in intensity make any kind of measurement subjective if more than one person be use to record the angle once again the line of best fit almost pass through the origin this could be down to systematic error for which there be plenty in this experiment with this information the rydberg constant can be calculate for all 3 transition v. analysis and error from the data 2 of the 3 calculate value give a value for the rydberg constant that lay within the associate error those be the one obtain from the red and blue transition the value associate with the cyan transition have such a small calculate error that it do not pas through the actual value for the rydberg constant a the line be so uniform and without blemish the error must be systematic now if a mean of all 3 value be take you find it give a value of 1.11x10 7 if the actual value of the rydberg constant be give to be 1.097x10 7 then the associate percentage error be 1.19 the standard deviation between all 3 value be 1.34x10 5 which give a standard error of +/-77365 this once again lie outside of the range of the actual value if transition 4 to 2 be take away and just the other two be consider we get a mean of 1.097x10 7 of course more than two piece of information be need to be able to establish a constant of some sort however this be still encourage it be clear to see that systematic error come into play when the cyan spectrum band be measure one possibility be that since background light be all around during the procedure it be entirely possible that background spectral line be measure and record instead of the one from the hydrogen emission spectrum lightbulb produce a continuous spectrum a continuous spectrum be one which all wavelength be present and there be no gap 16 alternatively the error could 've come from a misalignment of the spectrometer for all three of these discrete transition wavelength the set up be realign and return to the central maximum at the normal to the grate it be entirely possible that during the reset of the spectrometer the diffraction grate may have move within the slide or the grate stage may have move to some degree the fact that this transition be measure last may suggest why this be the only graph affected by such systematic error general source of error be hugely dependent on the quality of the set up for instance the dimension of the slit when measure the emission line work two way one way be to keep the slit a narrow a possible and get result with optimum precision but fail to measure the high order which lack intensity or keep the slit slightly wider which would reduce the precision however a well spread of result would be obtain in the case of this set up the slit be left a little bit wider so that for at least two of the line 4 order could be measure it be impossible to say what uncertainty this compromise have however it be most likely very small and can be ignore another possible source could be from the measurement of angle whilst calibrate the instrument each time an angle be measure it have an uncertainty of +/-0.0083 degree now throughout the set up the angle be measure 3 time not include the actual measurement if add in quadrature this lead to an error of +/-0.014 degree this may sound small but it be the equivalent of almost a whole arc minute in addition the measurement of an angle have 2 angle uncertainty so in total that give an angle uncertainty of +/-0.019 degree this be a very small uncertainty equivalent to just over 1 arc minute this assumes that every measurement be take to the near arc minute whereas on occasion a second opinion can give a completely different measurement over all of the measurement take it be found that the average uncertainty a a result of disagreement be 0.28 of an arc minute this be a surprisingly low uncertainty for angle measurement if we take this alone other uncertainty be difficult to calculate a they be either assumption or they be too difficult to compute without specialist equipment in conclusion despite the fact that the value obtain lie outside of the predict uncertainty this set up and experiment should be deem a a successful one due to the fact that a good value be obtain and a very slight unaccountable systematic error be so frequent for this kind of set up the error calculate must be below the true error of the experiment the fact that a percentage error of only 1.19 be obtain show the success and the validity of the experiment even though a slightly low percentage difference be expect due to the sophistication of the instrument it can still be say that the rydberg constant be calculate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and this be especially the case for transition 3 to 2 and 5 to 2 a the rydberg constant lie within their error range a.

wavelength of light where dsinŒ∏ be the path difference a show in fig 6 and m be the order number rearrange this equation we get therefore if we plot sinŒ∏ vs. m the gradient of the line of best fit of the graph will be the value of since we know the value of d we can calculate the wavelength of the light after determine the wavelength we have all the data we need to calculate the experimental value of rydberg constant use equation 1 fig 6. the path difference between light that go through the grate in this experiment we use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta and the wavelength of the light emit by a hydrogen lamp then calculate the rydberg constant in order to set up the spectrometer we focus the eyepiece and camera and align them with the axis of the collimator we set the cross wire a an `` x '' since it be easy to use this way then we turn the telescope which be the eyepiece and the camera lens through 90 degree and adjust the grate table until a reflect image be see

inclined when rotate the telescope we rotate the telescope left and right horizontally until we observe a light and note the value of theta at that position in order to get a value for the uncertainty in theta me and my lab partner both read the value and we estimate that there be an error of ¬± 1.45 √ó 10 -4 radian associate with our measurement since both of u read a value of theta for each order we have two value of theta associate with the light since the space between the central maximum and the emit light with the same colour of an order that have the same magnitude should be equal e.g the red emit light of order ¬± 1 have the same distance from the central maximum the angle theta of the positive and negative order should have the same magnitude therefore we plot the sine of the average value of theta against the magnitude of the order accord to equation 3 the gradient of the line of best fit corresponds to the value of therefore by multiply the gradient by d we determine the wavelength by use equation 1 we can obtain the value of rydberg constant iv error result discussion by use equation 1 and the theoretical value of the rydberg constant we predict that the long wavelength of the light that we could observe be 656 nm this light be create when electron drop from energy level three to energy level two use the standard colour spectrum chart we found that the

energy state to a low one and energy can be calculate by use where e be the energy h be planck 's constant and f be the frequency also where c be the speed of light ùúÜ be the wavelength combine equation 5 and 6 we get therefore energy be inversely proportional to the wavelength the light with the long wavelength be emit when the least amount of energy be release thus for the red light it initial state be 3 final state be 2. therefore n be equal to 3 and p be equal to 2. by use equation 1 and the wavelength we determine we calculate that the rydberg constant be 10622602.54 ¬± 28993.5 m -1 for the green light it initial state be 4 final state be 2. therefore we calculate the rydberg constant to be 9978172.747 ¬± 35283.0 m -1 compare these value with the theoretical value of the rydberg constant 10973731.6 m -1 there be 3.1 difference between the two value for the red emit light and 9.0 between the two value for the green emit light calculation be show in appendix the rydberg constant calculate use the data for the red light be more accurate than the one calculate use data of the green light one of the reason be that during the experiment we notice that the red light be observe to be more focus than the green light therefore we be more likely to get accurate measurement of theta for the red light graph 1.0 sinŒ∏ vs. m for the green light graph 2.0 sinŒ∏ vs. m for the red light the error associate with the reading of theta be random error it be cause by our judgement to determine this error we read off the theta from the scale alternatively and estimate that the uncertainty associate with the theta we measure be ¬± 1.45√ó10 -4 radian there be other source of error that affected our data for example when we observe the light the light be a bit blurry so defocus exist this mean that when we read off the angle the value be not precise also there be background light give that we be not work in a complete dark environment this could have impact on our data because the background light affected our judgement to place the emit light on the same place for each measurement and make it hard for u to observe the light clearly therefore we could not get measurement of theta also since we align the spectrometer manually the equipment could be not in the completely align position a a result of misalignment the value of angle theta we measure could be not accurate v. conclusion by do this experiment we determine the rydberg constant r ‚àû which have a measure value of 10973731.6 m -1 to 9978172.747 ¬± m -1 for the green emit light and 10622602.54 ¬± m -1 for the red emit light the method use in this experiment be to use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta associate with the emit light for an order m then calculate the wavelength ùúÜ associate with the light via equation 2 together with these data we use equation 1 to calculate the rydberg constant the percent difference between the theoretical value of rydberg constant and the experimental value we obtain be 9.0 for the green emit light and 3.1 for the red emit light calculation be show in appendix this experiment show that one way to determine the rydberg constant be to use a spectrometer during the experiment we measure the data we need without major problem and the final result be relatively close to the theoretical value of r ‚àû however we spent a large amount of time do the set-up therefore we fail to complete all the calculation within the time give from this experiment we learnt a way to determine the rydberg constant also we reinforce our knowledge on identify source of error such a defocus misalignment we also have a deeper understand of the importance of preliminary data by take preliminary data we gain some knowledge about the process thus we can take the definitive data more efficiently and accurately appendix formula use in calculate percent difference,expert,the
70,GS_FIJ609_Redacted,in our experiment there be three visible colour of line these be from ùêª ùõº ùêª ùõΩ and ùêª ùõæ and be produce by emission of certain energy photon and be part of the balmer series these line be measure until they be no longer clearly visible either side of the central maximum this produce four line either side of the central maximum for each colour and the angle at which the line be present be measure the grate spectrometer use have a vernier scale and so care be make to use it correctly a the number on it be small and hard to read after a long period of use some of the line in the telescope become hard to resolve and to distinguish colour and so the hydrogen lamp would be turn off and wait to cool this be to ensure that no line be miss during observation reduce the chance of outlier in our result from figure 3 you can see that the wavelength of the aqua light be much closer to the blue to alpha a the linear fit be much closer together this be because a previously mention from 3 a you move far away from the nucleus of hydrogen the energy level energy get closer together by and inverse square law and so the p=4 and p=5 energy level energy be closer than the p=3 and p=4 this lead to possible confusion between the aqua and blue line a not only be they close together but be also of similar colour this be a possible source of random error in the experiment and so great effort be make to distinguish between line by not keep the hydrogen lamp on for too long,extended,the

72,GS_MOX979_Redacted,pectroscopy be the study of the spectrum of light and how it change a light interacts with matter a spectrometer be a piece of equipment that allows for the study of spectrum by splitting light base on it wavelength when spectrum be study wavelength intensity and other property of the light beam be measure these property can give insight into anything the light have interact with before enter the spectrometer spectroscopy be use in the study of thing a small a electron to a large a star and be therefore one of the most important field of experimental physic 1 in this report the technique of spectroscopy be employ to check for the presence of the element hydrogen lithium copper and sodium in the sun 's atmosphere establish the chemical composition of star be important a it hold the key to understand star formation prove that this technique work for the sun 's atmosphere open the door for use of the technique on other star or any extrasolar entity that emits a continuous spectrum this could help far the understand of the formation of the universe to find out if one of the previously mention element be present in the sun 's atmosphere the element emission spectrum be first determine the grate spectrometer split light by wavelength and allow for the calculation of prominent wavelength the spectrum of hydrogen be obtain from a hydrogen lamp which excite hydrogen atom into emit light the sodium copper and lithium be all burn in salt form use a blowtorch the sodium and lithium be burn in their `` chloride '' salt form the chlorine require a lot more energy than the blowtorch to emit light and so the spectrum obtain be purely from the metal the same be true for the copper which be burn in it `` sulphate '' form once the spectrum of hydrogen sodium copper and lithium have be determine they be compare to the fraunhofer line these be give to the student by the lab assistant 3 the fraunhofer line be first note in 1802 by wollaston 3 in 1814 fraunhofer who the line be name after start work to determine the wavelength of the line which he label from letter a to k. these line be show in table i. forty-five year after the discovery of the fraunhofer line it be found by kirchoff and bunsen that the line coincide with the emission spectrum of element they theorise that since the light from the sun originates from fusion reaction in it core it must pas through the atmosphere where some wavelength be absorbed by element such a hydrogen this process be discuss far in part b of section ii the theory section of this report this process be what cause the dark line to appear in the spectrum of the sun when view from the earth the grate spectrometer investigate fraunhofer line s the diffraction grate produce point of constructive and destructive interference at angle base on the wavelength of the light diffract through the grate a diagram of light travel through a grate can be see in fig 1. note that for an actual grate there be many more beam of light than the two show in fig 1. however by symmetry the light will interfere constructively at the same angle for all beam therefore this diagram can be use to determine the relationship between angle and wavelength a can be see in fig 1 the upper beam will travel a great optical path length than the low beam from trigonometry it can be see that this path difference will be equal to the slit separation multiply by the sine of the diffraction angle for constructive interference the optical path difference must be equal to an integer number of wavelength this give the relationship between the angle for constructive interference and the wavelength of light passing through the grate ùëöùúÜ ùëë sin ùúÉ 1 where ùúÜ be the wavelength in metre ùëë be the slit separation in metre this be give by the grate use ùëö be the order of the peak 0 for central maximum and then numbered a 1 2 3 ‚Ä¶ a ùúÉ increase and ùúÉ be the angle with the normal for that peak where constructive interference occurs to calculate the wavelength experimentally the sine of the angle which cause constructive interference can be measure for several peak the angle can then be plot against their peak 's order m the gradient of this relationship will be equal to wavelength divide by the slit separation this give the relationship 2 from 2 we can obtain ùúÜ experimentally use ùúÜ ùëë √ó ùëë sin ùúÉ ùëëùëö 3 provide we measure the angle of diffraction at several peak quantum mechanic tell u that an electron can only exist around an atom at certain radius these radius correspond to specific energy the low energy radius be closer to the nucleus of atom for an electron to transition between these energy level it must receive or lose all the energy instantaneously when this happens the electron usually emits or absorbs light a see in fig 2. the energy gap between orbitals vary from element to element this mean that the set of energy require to promote or demote electron in an element be unique to that element from the planck-einstein equation it be know that ùê∏ ‚Ñéùúà 4 where ùê∏ be the energy of a light wave in joule ùúà be the frequency of the light wave in hertz and ‚Ñé be planck 's constant which be approximately 6.63 √ó 10 ‚àí34 ùêΩ ‚Ä¢ ùë† from 4 it can be deduce that the wavelength of the light emit or absorbed by an electron be give by 5 where Œ¥ùê∏ be the energy difference between the two energy level and c be the speed of light which be approximately 3 √ó 10 8 ùëö ‚Ä¢ ùë† ‚àí1 it follow from 5 that if every element have a unique set of energy gap then every element will emit and absorb a unique set of wavelength this mean that when electron in atom be demote they will emit light of specific wavelength this be know a an element 's emission spectrum an element 's absorption spectrum can be found by passing a continuous light spectrum through atom of say element the wavelength correspond to energy gap in the atom will be absorbed by the electron this leaf narrow band of low intensity in the result spectrum an element 's absorption and emission spectrum be complementary meaning that the band of low intensity in the absorption spectrum correspond to the band of emit light in the emission spectrum fig 2. two electron be demote to low energy level the energy lose be emit a electromagnetic radiation 1 iii experimental set up fig 3 show the basic part of the grate spectrometer use the spectrometer use for this experiment be the `` pasco sp-9268a '' 2 the grate employ have 2001 line per inch or around 78.78lines per mm 1 this give a slit separation of approximately 1.269 √ó 10 ‚àí5 ùëö. the main angle scale be comprise of separation of half a degree and the vernier read in arc minute to set up the apparatus for this experiment the grate be remove from the holder the eyepiece be then focus onto the crosshair such that it appear on an image 5-10m from the camera this be do in order to reduce eye strain a light source be then pass through the slit the camera be rotate such that the beam of light be centre on the crosshair the collimator be then focus so that a sharp image of the slit appear in the eyepiece the camera 's angle be adjust after focus to ensure that the crosshair be centre on the slit the holder in the kit use could be regulate at any angle relative to the slit for this experiment the holder have to be parallel to the slit to ensure normal incidence on the grate to do this the angle scale be use to rotate the eyepiece 90 degree from the central beam a mirror be place in the grate holder and the turntable be adjust such that grate reflect light from the slit directly into the crosshair on the eyepiece a the camera and the slit be exactly perpendicular it be then know that the mirror and therefore the holder be exactly 45 degree from the beam the scale could then be use to rotate the turntable 45 degree and the telescope 90degrees so that the light take a normal path through the spectrometer the angle on the scale be take a the `` zero '' for the experiment to take reading the light be pass through the slit and the telescope could be rotate such that the crosshair appear on the centre of the slit the angle difference between the `` zero '' angle and the angle on the scale give the value of ùúÉ for that peak a hydrogen lamp be position in front of the slit to obtain the hydrogen alpha wavelength for the metal use a salt be burn next to the slit allow light to pas through the slit the blowtorch be use to burn the metal salt a it burn at very high temperature with little visible light emission when use the blowtorch safety glass be use and the flame be kept far away from any person the data in this experiment be handle in python by the `` scipy '' function `` polyfit '' the `` polyfit '' function allows for a weight factor to be inputted into the parameter for every data point therefore to obtain more accurate value in the gradient the reciprocal of the uncertainty be use a weight factor the uncertainty give in the gradient by python be take a the random error in the final value for the hydrogen lamp the data in table ii be obtain when the hydrogen lamp be place at the slit red and blue line be observe through the lens the red line correspond to the hydrogen-ÔÅ° wavelength the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m -6 to m 6 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table ii be plot in python to give the graph in fig 4. the gradient and error

becomes parallel after passing through the collimator the grate the diffracts the light where it can be focus and view through the camera and eyepiece the diffraction angle can be read off the turntable if the camera/eyepiece be rotate such that the diffraction beam be centre on the crosshair the error in ùúÉ be take a ‚àö2 √ó 10‚Ä≤ ‚âà 0.2357¬∞ this be due to the fact two measurement be

gradient ùúÉ for m 0 have no error a it be define to be zero the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.94 this give an absolute error of around ¬±6ùëõùëö and result in a final wavelength of ùúÜ 658 ¬± 6 ùëõùëö this value corresponds to fraunhofer line c which have a wavelength of 656.6nm this result be strong evidence for the presence of hydrogen in the atmosphere of the sun in order to more thoroughly check for the presence of hydrogen the wavelength of hydrogen-ÔÅ¢ and hydrogen-ÔÅß could be determine if they be found in the fraunhofer line then this would prove to a much high certainty that the fraunhofer line be cause by light absorption from element in the sun 's atmosphere and that hydrogen be one of them for the sodium chloride salt the data in table iii be obtain when the sodium chloride be burn next to the slit orange line be see through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be again approximate to around 10 arc minute peak from m

3 we find ùúÜ 0.0465 √ó 1.269 √ó 10 ‚àí5 7 5.90 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 0.71 this give an absolute error of around ¬±4ùëõùëö and result in a final wavelength of ùúÜ 590 ¬± 4 ùëõùëö this value corresponds to fraunhofer line d which be a doublet of wavelength of 589nm and 589.6nm this result would suggest that there be likely to be a presence of sodium in the sun 's atmosphere although the fraunhofer line have a doublet of wavelength only one be see in the spectrometer if a high resolution spectrometer be use then the presence of two line could be confirm to give the best possible chance of see two line with the apparatus use several change could be make a brighter sodium lamp could be use instead of a flame a this will produce a more reliable spectrum a bright lamp would also allow for a small slit which would decrease the overlap of the two line decrease the slit space would also spread the spectrum more make the two wavelength more distinct for the copper sulphate salt the data in table iv be obtain when the copper sulphate be burn the light emit be diffuse and not very bright the light see through the lens be very spread out meaning the collimator may not have be able to make all the light beam parallel the error from the width of the peak and the parallax error be much large than for the other three at 40 arc minute peak

to give the graph in fig 6. the gradient and error obtain from the `` polyfit '' function be 0.0420 ÔÇ± 0.0017. from 3 we find ùúÜ=0.042√ó 1.269 √ó10‚àí5 8 5.33 x 10^-7m the percentage error be found to be approximately 4.06 this give an absolute error of around ¬±20ùëõùëö and result in a final wavelength of ùúÜ 530 ¬± 20 ùëõùëö the range of copper wavelength do correspond to fraunhofer line e which have a wavelength of 527nm however the uncertainty in the wavelength be too high to be certain that the wavelength of copper match with this line also due to what be know about star formation it be unlikely that there be high amount of copper in the sun 's atmosphere a repeat of this experiment would require a more accurate way of get the emission spectrum of copper for example burning a more flammable salt with a large flame a more sophisticated spectrometer could also be use for the lithium salt the data in table v be obtain when the lithium salt be burn next to the slit a red line be observe through the lens the error from the slit 's width and the parallax error be approximate to around 10 arc minute .. peak from m -4 to m 4 be visible through the eyepiece the data from table

fraunhofer line suggest little presence of lithium in the sun 's atmosphere it would seem odd that little lithium can be found in the sun 's atmosphere a it should be more easily fuse than for example sodium although the technique give good result for hydrogen and sodium the spectrum of lithium should be checked use a different method in order to verify that the wavelength measure be correct the aim of this experiment be to determine the wavelength of the element hydrogen sodium copper and lithium and to compare these to the fraunhofer line in order to determine the chemical composition of

73,GS_GEI074_Redacted,the red and blue fringe be bright and fairly easy to see although they be more space out than the purple fringe the purple fringe be quite dim and several order could not be see with the telescope include order -2 -3 and +3 for the other purple fringe it be often challenge to see the crosshair against the purple so there be a great uncertainty for these reading additionally the hydrogen lamp gradually heat up and light intensity decrease which meant that it be even harder to see the already dim purple fringe when the lamp be close to overheat the lamp be place very close to the slit so the effect of other light source be negligible all the order that could be see clearly be record for all the colour from -4 to +5 for red -5 to +7 for blue and -5 to +5 for purple exclude the miss order a state before the precision of the spectrometer be 1 arcminute however there be a variation in reading for the vernier scale each reading be therefore repeat twice with the average value take a the angle the uncertainty be take to be the standard error of the mean it be found that the provide diffraction grate have a different number of line per millimeter than be indicate by the supplier approximately 78.8 lines/mm 4 this value be use to calculate the slit separation d. by plot a graph of dsinŒ∏ against order m for each of the colour the wavelength of the light emit during each transition could be determine by find the gradient,extended,bal
74,GS_BPP712_Redacted,the rydberg constant relates the wavelength of a photon emit by an electron to the electron jump from a high to a low energy shell in order to obtain it value experimentally the light emit by a hydrogen lamp be diffract and the observable spectral line be compare to their correspond electron jump the result be r‚àû 11000000 ¬± 26000m ‚àí1 which be large than the agree value by 0.249 i n 1888 a formula describe the wavelength of emit light from hydrogen like element be determine empirically by the swedish physicist johannes rydberg it incorporate a constant call the rydberg constant r ‚àû with a value of 10973731.6m ‚àí1 ref 1 25 year later the rutherford-bohr atom model be publish and r ‚àû be derive from more fundamental constant to determine the value of the rydberg constant experimentally we inspect spectral line create by hydrogen with a grate spectrometer simultaneously the formula relate the wavelength to the electron energy shell jump rydberg formula be test for validity accord to huygen 's principle a light wave encounter a grate start create new circular wave these then interfere with each other and create observable maximum and minimum two adjacent slit in a grate form a double slit it can be therefore use a a simplify model fig 1 fig 1. a planar light beam encounter a double slit and create two circular wave every blue line corresponds to a crest wavefront the distance between two adjacent line be therefore equal to the wavelength Œª. the red line represent a sample of the create maximum by interference s 1 and s 2 be path that light have to travel from each slit to create a maximum a maximum can only be create if two crest interfere with each other thus s 1 and s 2 have to be multiple of the wavelength in a grate the distance between two adjacent slit d be very small when compare to s 1 and s 2 thus it might be assume that the two path be parallel fig 2 a the difference in Œ∏ between them be negligible a forward travel light wave can be described a œà e i œât‚àíkx where k be define to be the wave vector and œâ the wave angular frequency assume that x be in the direction of the two diffract beam then the ray in fig 2 can be define a 1 where 1 represent the amplitude with respect to location of beam 1 and 2 represent beam 2 by incorporate the additional distance of d sin Œ∏ in order to form a maximum the two wave must interfere with their crest so that the phase difference of the two wavefunctions should be a multiple m of their wavelength Œª mŒª arg œà 2 ‚àí arg œà 1 and thus for the order number m ... ‚àí2 ‚àí1 0 1 2 ... the angle Œ∏ for each create maximum be therefore only dependent on the slit width and the wavelength of the diffract light because the inspect light might consist of several wavelength their interference pattern might overlap reduce d prevents this a Œ∏ would increase for small value the most suitable atom model to obtain the rydberg constant r ‚àû be the bohr model accord to which electron orbit around a positively charge and very heavy nucleus whilst be on a specific energy shell fig 3 the result centrifugal force f cent be then equal and opposite to the attractive coulomb force f coul so that the electron stay in it orbit those electron be able to move from high to low energy shell by emit energy in the form of photon and move to high energy shell by gain energy 2 the far the shell from the nucleus the more energy the orbit electron have fig 3 an equation for the wavelength of an emit photon by an electron jumping from a shell n to a shell p can be derive by use a force ansatz so that f cent f coul and thus ‚àí where z be the number of proton in the nucleus and k 1 4œÄ 0 thus v n and r n be the velocity and radius of the electron 's movement on the n'th energy shell and m e be the electron mass this result in accord to bohr the angular momentum of every electron can be described a l n h 2œÄ where h represent planck 's constant this be equal to the product of the electron 's moment of inertia and it angular frequency n h 2œÄ m e r 2 n vn rn thus by substitute equation 5 into 4 r n can be define a 6 in order to determine the total energy of an electron on the nth shell e n it kinetic and potential energy need to be add the potential energy e p ot be equal to the integral from r n to ‚àû over f coul with respect to r. thus rn the kinetic energy e kin can be found by divide equation 4 by 2 and so e kin kz e 2 2rn hence 2r n so if an electron jump from the n'th shell onto the p'th shell it release energy of ‚àÜe ‚àíkz e 2 2rn ‚àí ‚àíkz e 2 2rp by substitute equation 6 the release energy be described a the energy of a photon be give by e p h hf h c Œª where c be the speed of light f be the photon 's frequency and Œª be the photon 's wavelength due to energy conservation e p h ‚àÜe thus where r ‚àû denotes the rydberg constant hydrogen have only one proton in it nucleus z 1 hence a hydrogen lamp creates an electrostatic field which excites electron from the hydrogen and increase their kinetic energy those electron then lose their additional energy and jump to low energy shell by emit a photon only some jump create visible wavelength which be know a the balmer series fig 5 the setup be first adjust with a sodium lamp so that the collimator the grate and the telescope ax be align for Œ∏ 0 180 o where m 0 which have to be then subtract from every measurement of the diffraction angle additionally m and Œ∏ be define to be positive in the direction up from m 0 fig 5 and negative in the opposite direction the hydrogen lamp be place a close to the slit a possible to minimise the effect of ambient light a grate with 300 line per 1mm be chosen for the experiment a accord to equation 3 the high the density of slit the easy it be to distinguish two close line from each other however a grate with a high line density could not be use a Œ∏ be become too large to be properly measure and the observe spectral line to faint at m 0 a pink/violet line could be observe fig 6a this be a combination of all the other observable colour furthermore dark blue fig 6b turquoise fig 6c and red fig 6d spectral line be observe also a very faint purple line be see but it be to faint to be record and be therefore exclude from measurement preliminary all three observe colour seem to fit into the balmer series see section iib the edge of those line be perceive a much sharper by our eye the blurriness in fig 6 be a result of bad camera quality and therefore do not affect the actual measurement quality accord to equation 3 Œ∏ be approximately proportional to Œª for small value so the far a spectral line be away from m 0 the large be it wavelength therefore the correspond photon have less energy a e p h h c Œª simultaneously the wavelength for each colour be determine by plot m against sin Œ∏ fig 7 a linear regression be the best approximation for the collect data for all data point intercept the regression line with their errorbars so small that not visible in graph thus equation 3 be corroborate and the slope of the linear regession be then equal to d Œª where d 1mm 300 the wavelength be therefore the product of the correspond slope and 1mm 300 accord to the spectrum of visible light these wavelength roughly correspond to the observe colour in fig 6 and also to the colour emit in the balmer series fig 4 have value of Œª and correspond n equation 8 can be use to determine r ‚àû so Œª ‚àí1 should be proportional to ‚àí 1 n 2 ‚àí 1 p 2 where p 2 and the slope would be then equal to r ‚àû fig 8 the three data point align so that a justified linear regression can be conduct the result function have a y-intercept of 5700 ¬± 4800m ‚àí1 it should however go through the origin in order to show proportionality it value be dominate by the scale use for the y-axis the intercept can be thus neglect and a direct proportionality between the two ax can be assume a a result equation 8 be verify the slope of the function be then equal to the rydberg constant a built in vernier scale be use to measure the angle Œ∏ whose small unit be 1 arcminute 1 60 o hence the uncertainty of the measure angle be half of it œÉ Œ∏ 1 120 o however the observe spectral line have a certain width and the cross wire be aim at their estimate middle but this width increase the uncertainty of Œ∏ fig 9

aim at each side of the spectral line to determine ‚àÜŒ∏ calculate the correspond error the angle of both edge of the spectral line be measure and ‚àÜŒ∏ be then calculate for every colour for every m. the measurement error of 1 120 o be incorported a a measurement error into the calculation ‚àÜŒ∏ be then divide by 2 a the deviation from the centre of the line can be at most only half of it width the measurement error of each possible deviation from the centre be then add to the value to simulate the large deviation this be then define a the new œÉ Œ∏ all value in the appendix this uncertainty of Œ∏ also incorporates the diffraction cause be the collimator and the telescope a both use glass lens the slit be well align with the lens for the centre of all wavelength for m 0 be at Œ∏ 180 o hence the lens diffraction only influence the width of the strip and not their location however for certainty all the measurement be take quickly so that the refractive index of the surround air would not change significantly due to temperature or pressure change additionally no ambient light be shin whilst the measurement be take to increase the visibility of the spectral line in fig 7 all linear regression have a small negative yintercept but they all should be theoretically equal to zero thus a systematical error might have occur lower the measure value of Œ∏. the most probable origin of this error be an inaccurate calibration of the spectrometer small value of Œª would lead then to large value of Œª ‚àí1 and would thus explain the positive intercept in fig 8. the official value of r ‚àû be 10973731.6m ‚àí1 ref 1 our experimentally determine value be however 11000000 ¬± 26000m ‚àí1 the official number do therefore not lie within the value of the obtain r ‚àû it be however very close a it be small by only 0.239 hence the official value of the rydberg constant be not verify by this experiment the result be very precise with an uncertainty of only 0.236 however the slope

wavelength be measure for blue aqua and red emission line which be calculate to be 434.8 ¬± 2.4 nm 486.9 ¬± 1.3 nm and 659.6 ¬± 2.2 nm respectively with their true value be 434nm 486nm and 656nm 1 the rydberg constant be then deduce to be 10940685.2 ¬± 12293.4 m ‚àí1 which be accurate with a 0.3 error compare to the theoretical value of 10973731.6 m ‚àí1 2 spectrometer be use to examine the spectrum of light such that wavelength of light over the range of continuous absorption or emission line spectrum can be calculate with emission line spectrum emit by hot gas spectroscopy can be use to measure the width of the spectral line in order to determine property of the emit gas spectrometer be incredibly accurate device that can be use to study flame star plasma and semiconductor 2 for example in astronomy they can be use to measure the age rotational velocity and recessional velocity of interstellar object 3 the aim of this experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant use this spectroscopy technique involve a grate spectrometer on the emission line spectrum produce by hydrogen gas this be a physical constant that appear in the balmer formula for the spectral line of a hydrogen atom in order to do this the wavelength of the emission line be calculate by measure their diffraction angle after passing through the grate spectrometer emission line spectrum occur when hot gas emit spectrum and be present a a few define line of different colour which correspond to the specific wavelength of light emit by the gas these spectral line be unique to each element so can be use to identify them 1 for example the emission line spectrum for hydrogen can be show in fig 1. when an electron in an atom receives energy for example from heat the electron move to a high energy level cause the atom to be in an excite state however this state be unstable a atom be most stable in their ground state so the electron return to a low energy level by release it excess energy a a photon in the case of a hydrogen atom fig 1. the emission line spectrum produce by hydrogen gas show the four specific wavelength emit on the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum violet blue aqua and red this be what should be view during the experiment through the spectrometer the violet line be weak so sometimes can not be see image adapt from 1 there be multiple energy state that electron transition can occur between quantum mechanic suggests that these energy level exist discretely therefore the emit photon have discrete energy and specific wavelength such that where e be the energy of the photon h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light in a vacuum and Œª be the wavelength of the photon this mean the presence of spectral line can be explain by quantum mechanic 4 fig 2. possible electron transition show how they relate to the balmer and lyman series for any atom the high energy level that the electron transition from can be from any number up to infinity but it be the energy level that the electron transition to that determines the series 5 the great the energy difference between the two transition state the shorter the wavelength of the emit photon a it have more energy if the energy difference be great enough the wavelength may be too short to be in the visible spectrum so would not be detect by the spectroscope a it lie in the ultraviolet range likewise if the energy difference be very small the wavelength may be too long to be in the visible spectrum so also would not be detect by the spectroscope a it lie in the infrared range the possible energy transition for hydrogen atom that emit photon in the visible range be from high level to the second orbital energy level this transition to the second energy level be know a the balmer series this idea of energy level and electron transition can be show in fig 2. the balmer series be where electron transition to n 2 from n ‚â• 3 where n be the principal quantum number or energy level of the electron 4 in hydrogen both visible light transition and ultraviolet transition form the balmer series with ultraviolet transition also form the lyman series infrared transition form the paschen and pfund series the lyman paschen and pfund series have transition from high energy level to the first third and fourth energy level respectively 6 there be four wavelength displayed in the visible light spectrum for hydrogen 410nm 434nm 486nm and 656nm which correspond to the colour violet blue aqua and red respectively 1 the other balmer line with wavelength shorter than 400nm be in the ultraviolet spectrum and be not visible therefore in order for spectral line to appear on the visible light spectrum the electron transition must emit a photon of the correct wavelength the high energy level which the electron can transition from in order to do this have the quantum number n 6. the spectrometer can be use to view these spectral line by use a lens to produce a collimate beam of light which it disperses with a grate this disperse spectrum be then focus and view with an eyepiece the component that make up the spectrometer can be show in fig 3. fig 3. schematic diagram of the spectrometer and the three main component that make it up the collimator diffraction grate and the telescope the telescope can be consider a the camera and eyepiece this show the path that light take from the source through the device to the eyepiece where the spectral line can be view 2 light from the source travel through a narrow slit where it enters the spectrometer a collimate lens in the spectrometer make the beam parallel therefore all the light ray hit the diffraction grate at the same angle of incidence where this diffract light be then focus onto a cross-hair x by a camera lens an eyepiece be use to view a magnify image of the disperse spectrum 2 the grate consists of many equally space narrow slit with the slit separation be d. the light with wavelength Œª diffracts through these slit and the diffract beam interfere with each other the diffraction effect be optimal with maximum wavefront curvature when the grate space have a similar magnitude to the wavelength of the incoming ray a maximum occurs when diffract ray interfere constructively so phase difference between neighbour ray be an integer multiple n of 2œÄ where path difference be dsinŒ∏ with Œ∏ be the diffraction angle therefore where n represent a positive or negative order number this path difference be displayed in fig 4. the wave be out of phase so interfere destructively to form point of minimum when the path difference be nŒª 2 the wave be in phase so interfere constructively to form point of maximum in both case n be an even integer transition wavelength in hydrogen be give by where n be an integer represent the energy level of the initial state of the atom and p be an integer represent the energy level of the final state of the atom here due to the balmer series in hydrogen for the visible spectrum p 2 and n 3,4,5 ... a the electron drop down from a high energy level to the second energy level 2 the rydberg constant be r ‚àû which have a theoretical value of 10973731.6 m ‚àí1 and can be described in term of fundamental constant where c be the speed of light m e be the mass of an electron h be planck 's constant and Œ± be the fine constant which can be define a where 0 be the permittivity of free space firstly we have to set up the spectrometer to ensure that it be properly align and focus in this way it could be use to make accurate measurement competent of precision of under three part in ten thousand the focus ensure that there be no parallax between the image and cross wire and the telescope need to be align with the axis of the collimator the eyepiece be focus onto the cross wire so that the image be at a convenient view distance without eye strain the camera lens be then focus by view a distant object roughly 5-10 metre away through the lens and focus this object onto the cross wire we place the sodium lamp in front of the slit to illuminate it turn the light off in the room to make this more effective a sodium lamp be use a the light source for set up the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp use later for take measurement would overheat if left on for too long we adjust the collimator 's focus without modify the camera focus until the image of the slit be sharply focus onto the cross wire the clamp screw and slow-motion drive be then adjust in order to align the camera and cross wire so that the cross wire be set on the slit image the slowmotion drive allow the camera to be rotate smoothly and by precise amount we rotate the cross wire a we found that they be most easily use when marked a an x instead of a '+ we move the telescope through exactly 90 degree use the rotation drive and clamped it in position there be two scale use in order to do this precisely the main scale divide into half of a degree and the vernier scale divide into arc minute a mirror be place in the grate holder and the grate table rotate until we could see the reflect image of the slit in the eyepiece once this occur we knew that the mirror be at 45 degree to the incident beam from the collimator we use the adjustment screw under the grate table to modify the height of the image and the grate drive to set the mirror so that the slit image be precisely at the cross wire use the reading that the telescope be set at when it be 90 degree we then rotate the mirror through exactly 45 degree so that it be accurately set at 0 degree incidence to the normal we then move the telescope back 90 degree so that it be at 0 degree orientation the spectrometer be now focus and align so measurement could be take 2 the mirror be replace with a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm and the sodium lamp be replace with a hydrogen gas lamp through the eyepiece the emission line spectrum of hydrogen could be view a we rotate the telescope use the slow-motion drive for each transition wavelength we measure the diffraction angle Œ∏ a a function of order m for positive and negative m value from the zeroth order the reading on the scale be note at the zeroth order a the reference value which be deduct from each transition wavelength reading to get Œ∏. reading be record in degree and then arcminute use both the scale for some wavelength we found that we could obtain more order than for others a others grow dimmer faster for example blue we manage to obtain Œ∏ and m value for blue aqua and red line but not purple line for each colour wavelength record a graph of sinŒ∏ against m could be plot from equation 3 the gradient of this graph be Œª d so the wavelength of each colour spectral line could be calculate from multiply the gradient by the grate space use equation 4we calculate the rydberg constant for each wavelength then could use these to obtain an average value for the constant the result for the variation of sinŒ∏ against order m for blue spectral line be present in fig 5. the error bar be barely visible a they be so small that they may be consider negligible this be due to the precision of the spectrometer the gradient of the slope be 3.43 ¬± 0.0192 x 10 ‚àí2 the diffraction angle Œ∏ be a function of the reference value and the record angle both of which have an error of half an arc minute a this be half an increment on the vernier scale therefore this error be add twice in quadrature to calculate the error in Œ∏ which be propagate through use function error to calculate the error in sinŒ∏ use equation 3 the gradient multiply by the grate space be equal to Œª which can be calculate to be 434.8 ¬± 2.4 nm have a 0.56 uncertainty the theoretical value of the wavelength for blue spectral line here be 434nm which lie within the uncertainty therefore there be only a 0.18 error in our result show that it be extremely accurate with the wavelength calculate equation 3 can be use to calculate the rydberg constant r ‚àû use the balmer series n 5 for blue wavelength r ‚àû be 10953123.1 ¬± 61473.1 m ‚àí1 this be an uncertainty of 0.56 and an error of 0.19 from the theoretical value of 10973731.6 m ‚àí1 therefore our result here be very accurate also because the theoretical value lie within the uncertainty of our calculate result the result for the variation of sinŒ∏ against order m for aqua spectral line be present in fig 6. the gradient of the slope be 3.84 ¬± 0.0104 x 10 ‚àí2 use this the wavelength for aqua be calculate to be 486.9 ¬± 1.3 nm a 0.27 uncertainty error be calculate in the same way a described for the blue wavelength this compare to the theoretical value of Œª be 486nm so our result have an error of 0.19 and be thus very accurate from the balmer series n 4 for aqua wavelength so r ‚àû can be calculate from this data to be 10952833.7 ¬± 29572.5 m ‚àí1 this be an uncertainty of 0.27 and have an error of 0.19 compare to the theoretical value this result be also very accurate due to the small percentage error and because the theoretical value lie within the uncertainty of the r ‚àû we calculate in the same way a the previous two colour the wavelength for red could be calculate from the plot of sinŒ∏ against order m which be present in fig 7. the gradient of the slope be 5.2 ¬± 0.017 x 10 ‚àí2 this lead to the calculate wavelength to be 659.6 ¬± 2.2 nm which be a 0.33 uncertainty the theoretical value of Œª be 656nm therefore our result have a 0.55 error which be slightly large than the error calculate in the other wavelength but be still very small thus our result be accurate use n=3 from the balmer series for red wavelength r ‚àû can be calculate to be 10916098.9 ¬± 35895.6 m ‚àí1 this have a 0.33 uncertainty and have a 0.53 error so this result be very accurate despite have a large error than the previous value calculate for r ‚àû to deduce an overall value for r ‚àû for this experiment the mean of the three r ‚àû value calculate for the individual wavelength on the emission line spectrum for hydrogen be take this prove to be 10940685.2 ¬± 12293.4 m ‚àí1 with the error calculate use standard error of the three r ‚àû value this result have a 0.09 uncertainty and a 0.3 error from the theoretical value both of which be very small thus fig 7. the result for sinŒ∏ plot against the order m for the red spectral line observe with the spectrometer with precise value and a strong positive correlation there be again negligible error bar however the error in this gradient be large than the error in the gradient of fig 5 and fig 6. prove the accuracy of this result and that systematic error be unlikely the main error take into account although very small be the human error in take reading from the scale we take this to be half an increment on the vernier scale -0.5 arc minute this be because the room be dark and the scale be very small to read so we have to use a magnify glass this error be propagate throughout equation 3 and 4 and then combine with the standard error of multiple data set to calculate the overall error in r ‚àû a show in table 1 the r ‚àû value calculate for each different colour photon be always slightly below the theoretical value despite all still be very accurate this may have be cause by a small systematic error there be several possible cause of this systematic error a we have to consider the effect of spectrometer misalignment defocus lamp position grate period air pressure and humidity and background light defocus seem unlikely because the emission line be very sharp and in focus the most likely cause of this systematic error be probably a slight misalignment in the spectrometer this may have explain why all the wavelength value calculate for each spectral line be slightly large than their theoretical value and thus the rydberg constant be always small furthermore Œ∏ value should have be the same for positive and negative order of the same magnitude however some be out by 0.5 which highlight how there be a small spectrometer misalignment the spectral resolution of the diffraction grate be limited to the grate period d. to obtain a high spectral resolution grating should be of a very large size or there should be a high number density of slit however this be difficult due to the high-precision process of the spectrometer 7 the grate period calculate from the number of line per mm give on the grate slide may not have be the exact value of the period but in fact slightly large which would explain the slightly large wavelength calculate other factor to consider be air pressure and humidity the theoretical wavelength value give be for those photon travel through a vacuum however the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in air be small to that in a vacuum this be primarily due to the atmosphere have a refractive index that affect the curvature of the electromagnetic path 8 this refractivity of air be dependent on pressure temperature and humidity a they all affect the density of air in a vacuum pressure be far low than the atmospheric pressure experienced in the room there be also matter in the air but not in a vacuum which affect the path of the diffract wave therefore take measurement for pressure temperature and humidity and use formula the density of the room can be calculate in order to calculate the refractive index n of air in the room this can be use to convert the value obtain for wavelength into the wavelength in a vacuum a Œª vac nŒª air 9 these new value could then be use to calculate r ‚àû on the other hand the experiment can be conduct in a vacuum chamber to make the wavelength value more accurate to the theoretical vacuum value background light may have make it harder to view certain order a although external light do n't affect the position of spectral line it affect their relative intensity to the background view through the spectrometer this may have affected how for each colour photon we always found more negative order than positive order a positive and negative order be suppose to be symmetrical about the zeroth order in the same way our lamp position may have obstruct the view of some emission line so some be too faint to be see therefore to improve we could have turn all lamp off before take reading a we may have see more emission line at full intensity and we perhaps could have obtain more data point lead to an even more accurate gradient we may also have see the fourth violet emission line a this be include in the visible range for hydrogen emission line this would increase precision of result and the accuracy of the calculate rydberg constant the aim of the experiment be to calculate the rydberg constant r ‚àû by use a grate spectrometer to calculate the transition wavelength produce in the visible range of the emission line spectrum for hydrogen gas our result for the wavelength r ‚àû be very accurate and close to the true value with r ‚àû calculate to be 10940685.2 ¬± 12293.4 m ‚àí1 only have a 0.3 error the spectrometer be use effectively to give precise measurement for value of the diffraction angle Œ∏ against order m and we be able to obtain value of Œ∏ for order of high magnitude up to 12 for aqua emission line the main error account for be the human error in take reading from the vernier scale on the spectrometer however small systematic error be consider in the data analysis a although our result be incredibly accurate they be n't perfect and be all out by a similar amount to improve the experiment perhaps multiple reading could have be take with the experiment repeat and the mean reading record to reduce uncertainty and human error possible systematic error could be take into account such a consider the effect of the atmosphere 's refractive index on the wavelength of the photon and thus conduct the experiment in a vacuum chamber measurement could have be take in order to make estimation for possible systematic error or to determine them which could then be include in the calculation of error also all background light should be eliminate in order to view the spectral line easily a perhaps more could have be

set up can be see in fig 1. sodium lamp be use to ready the spectrometer a it produce high intensity light and have a longer operational time than the hydrogen lamp however the sodium lamp do take some time about 2 minute to reach maximum intensity it have a manageable warm up time this overall make the set up of the spectrometer much easy a time can be take to make fine adjustment the disadvantage of use a hydrogen lamp instead of shin light through a vial of vaporise hydrogen and measure an absorption spectrum be that lamp only remains bright enough to make measurement of the low wavelength light for about 10 minute it also only have an operational time of 20 minute this meant that the measurement have to make quickly this however be still more manageable than the alternate method of produce the hydrogen spectrum a the light emit through the hydrogen may have it own spectrum this may lead to confusion when analyse the overall spectrum the sodium lamp be set up in front

it be position in front of the slit and adjust until the line appear to be dot the filter be then taped on to the slit securely hold it in position the head of the spectrometer be rotate from left to right and we observe if the crosshair pass through the centre of the dot if the crosshair do n't then the stand hold the diffraction grate be adjust use the 3 level screw until it do the filter be then remove a diagram of the filter can be see in fig 2 the diffraction grate be also place such that it be perpendicular to the slit and lens array in front of the lamp preliminary data of the order and angle at which the order appear be make use the sodium lamp here we notice that it be best to make measurement by rotate the head in one direction ie go from m= -4 to m=4 rather than start at the m=0 and change direction after reach the high order this be because change direction occasionally cause the spectrometer to shift a it be not fix to the table finally we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be place such that it be closer to the slit and the centre of the lamp face the slit the centre of the lamp be the brightest part of it the slit be also make to be a bit wider than before this allow more light into the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp be dimmer than the sodium lamp this however decrease the resolution of the spectral line the spectrometer be refocus and measurement be make first we slowly move from the 0 th order a this be the easy to identify to the -4 th order which we define to be in the clockwise direction then we measure the angle at which the red spectral line appear make sure to keep the crosshair in the centre of the line this be do by use the fine adjustment screw locate on the base we then measure the angle of the subsequent order of the red line until we reach m +4 we then repeat the same technique with the blue and purple line the observe spectral pattern of hydrogen can be see in fig 3 and the data of the angle of each order for each spectral line can be see in appendix a. a see in fig 3 the pattern also contains a rainbow artefact this be due to light from the surround enter the spectrometer if the experiment be do

82,GS_UGX035_Redacted,troscopy method with a hydrogen lamp the aim be to determine a value for the rydberg constant while investigate the effectiveness of the grate spectrometer in study the spectrum of light a value of 10 890 000 ¬± 40 000 m 1 be obtain for the rydberg constant this result highlight the successful operation of the grate spectrometer because a precise result be found wavelength of 656.1 ¬± 2.7 nm 490.8 ¬± 3.4 nm and 439.8 ¬± 6.0 nm be calculate for red aqua and blue photon respectively these intermediate result far show the effective use of the spectrometer in achieve precision the result be only a little inaccurate because within experimental uncertainty it do n't quite agree with the accepted value of 10 973 736.6 m 1 for the rydberg constant this be due to a small systematic error t he grate spectrometer be a device that be construct with a specific pathway for light spectroscopy involves the study of spectrum by take measurement of radiation and this device be just one of many that can be use for this purpose electromagnetic radiation be able to pas through the spectrometer via a slit and then a collimator grate and camera before enter an eyepiece for observation the grate spectrometer be a great tool and can be use to show relationship between many quantity through the calculation of specific wavelength and constant like that of the rydberg constant this ability to identify relationship mean it have great importance with it application for example the result it be capable of produce allow the determination of gas temperature and density on a small scale and the velocity of galaxy with respect to each other on a large scale 1 exploit these experimental property meant that the rydberg constant could be found by take measurement of the emission spectrum produce by a hydrogen lamp specifically it be the analysis of interference pattern produce by the grate for different wavelength that contribute to the calculation diffraction be a process that result in the spread of wave a they pas an aperture or edge electromagnetic radiation can be consider to occur in waveform so it be able to undergo this phenomenon in the case of the grate spectrometer there be a diffraction grate which act a multiple aperture a the light wave pass through the aperture diffraction will occur and this will be more observable when the width of the aperture be similar to that of the light wavelength the grate consists of many narrow slit which have the same width and be separate equally each slit cause diffraction to occur and therefore interference can also happen this be because the light wave from each slit will cross path and superimpose path difference be the respective difference in distance travel by wave after exit the slit it be illustrate in fig 1 and through the use of trigonometry the path difference be give by where be the path difference d be the slit separation and ‚úì be the diffraction angle the superposition result in an interference pattern form because the wave be able to interfere with each other periodically such that a consistent pattern be produce the interference occurs constructively when the wave meet in phase meaning there be a phase difference between them of a multiple of 2‚á° where be the phase difference and m be the order number the wavenumber which be write a k be characteristic to a wave and be consider a the phase per unit distance a demonstrate by this equation where be the wavelength the fractional distance of the wavelength move in other word the phase difference relates to the path difference by the follow equation equate the result in equation 1 equation 2 and equation 4gives the follow relationship between the separation of slit and the wavelength b. energy level in quantum theory atom consist of neutron and proton in their central nucleus with electron in surround orbital shell quantum theory explains the characteristic behaviour of the electron because of the quantum mechanical system they can be consider to act in the atom be clearly stable because it can retain it initial state in most case provide that it be not radioactive the explanation for the model of the atom by classical mechanic be unstable because it allows the electron to have any energy whereas in quantum mechanic the electron can only have specific discrete value of energy the electron be a negatively charge particle and will experience an attractive force due to it interaction with the positively charge nucleus a coulomb 's law state the presence of a resultant force by newton 's second law mean it be also accelerate accord to the larmor formula 3 the electron will radiate power because it be both charge and accelerate this radiation represent an energy loss and in the classical model this electron would spiral into the nucleus a represent in fig 2 meaning that the whole atom itself appear to be unstable fig 2. the classical model to the left show an electron that loses energy collapse towards the nucleus this electron be particle like the quantum model to the right show a stable electron orbit the nucleus with fix energy this electron be wave like 4 the quantum model allows electron to have discrete quantity of energy a way in which this be possible be if the electron be to act a stand wave in each orbit the orbit have a circumference that be a multiple of the electron 's wavelength which mean the orbit can only occur at specific distance from the nucleus the electron can only exist in these discrete orbit therefore they can only transition between these particular position 5 these transition amount to a change in total energy because there be a change in both potential energy and kinetic energy there be two case one where an electron drop an energy level and another where it rise an energy level rise an energy level require a gain in energy this be ultimately because the potential energy be increase and the attraction to the nucleus must be overcome fig 3. the electron move from a discrete high energy level to a discrete low energy level therefore there be a discrete energy loss which occurs a electromagnetic radiation this electromagnetic radiation be present a a photon characterise by a specific wavelength and frequency drop an energy level amount to a decrease in energy and it be this case that be explore in this experiment the decrease in energy be represent by the emission of a photon a fig 3 illustrates the photon emit will have a discrete amount of energy because of the discrete orbitals these packet of energy be quantise by the follow equation where e be the energy of the photon h be planck 's constant and ‚å´ be the frequency of the photon this can be rewrite a where c be the speed of light consider this energy be quantise there must be a some kind of relationship between the energy of emit photon and their orbital ring or in other word energy level this energy be a function of wavelength a equation 7 show and so this relationship can be express by the equation where be specifically the wavelength of the emit photon in a vacuum r 1 be the rydberg constant z be the atomic number n be the initial energy level of the electron and p be the final energy level of the electron in the case of hydrogen because it only have one the equation simplifies to the transition between the energy level have many combination so they be divide in to series which be characterise by the final energy level of the electron the balmer series be one that be define for when electron drop down to the second energy level other series such a the lyman and paschen be define by energy level of 1 and 3 respectively 6 the significance of the balmer series be that it be the only series that produce wavelength within the visible light spectrum therefore throughout the analysis of the hydrogen emission spectrum the only line that can be view directly by eye in the laboratory be from the balmer series the transition which give visible light only go up to the point where the electron begin at energy level 6. this be because the change in energy level becomes so large that the wavelength of the emit photon be too small to be observe the human eye can view electromagnetic wave with wavelength between 400 and 700 nm the wavelength emit on the visible spectrum correspond to different colour emission a picture in fig 4. the grate spectrometer be set up on a raise platform by be attach to a small table so that all observation could easily be take at eye level throughout the experiment it be make sure that the optical equipment be not touch so that the equipment be clean and light could travel a expect the camera lens of the telescope be focus onto an object that be around 5 to 10 meter away this be do in a well lit room to make the image easy for view the eyepiece lens be then focus onto the crosshair to reduce parallax between the image and the crosshair itself once this be do the experiment be move into a darken room the telescope be align directly with the axis of the collimator so that they be position in a straight line a sodium lamp be place behind the slit for the rest of the setup in order to protect the hydrogen lamp a prolong use of it could have cause it to overheat and become damage the light from the slit be view through the eyepiece and the focus of the collimator be adjust until slit light be focus on the crosshair the slit size be reduce to the point where it be more manageable to focus it the crosshair be also rotate to a cross position a oppose to a plus position to aid this focus process the main scale and vernier scale be use to record the exact position of the telescope the grate table be rotate through 90 degree with the slow motion drive aid this rotation to be a accurate a possible once it be clamped tightly into position a mirror be place in the holder fig 5. the light from the hydrogen lamp pass through the slit and a reduce segment of it be capture this fraction of light can be diffract by the slit but the ray of light be make parallel when they pas through the collimator these parallel beam be then diffract by the diffraction grate have met it surface perpendicularly these diffract light ray then enter the telescope and be magnify into the eyepiece by passing through the camera lens and eyepiece lens 8 the holder be rotate until a reflect image from the collimator be view from the eyepiece to ensure that the grate surface be at 45 degree to the incident ray the adjustment screw on the grate table be alter so that the table be horizontal and at a height where the image be align with the crosshair the angle of the grate table be record and rotate through by 45 degree use the table and slow motion drive so that it surface be perpendicular to the incident ray the mirror be replace for a diffraction grate of 78.8 line per mm the telescope be finally then move back through 90 o to it original position so it be in alignment with the slit collimator and grate at this original position the light be observe a be a maximum with a combination of colour that have not be diffract at all this be take to be the reference point for order 0 and it position be record a 183.5 o 5 ¬± 0.5 the spectral line be observe briefly by rotate the telescope the slit size be alter by decrease and increase it until the line could be view optimally start from the maximum order at 183.5 o 5 the positive direction be take to be clockwise in which the scale of the angle reading increase the order record from here be also take to be positive the telescope be slowly rotate around until the first order be locate the colour present be record position the crosshair on each spectral line meant the angle on the scale could be measure for each colour at order 1. this be repeat across the whole quadrant for the subsequent order until no more line could be observe at all the telescope be then take in the counterclockwise direction from the reference point and the same reading be record such that the angle on the scale be decrease and the order be consider to be negative three colour be observe throughout the experiment these be red aqua and blue which can also be name h-‚Üµ h-and h-respectively in relation to their electron 's initial position for all of these wavelength there be a positive correlation present between the sine of the diffraction angle and the order associate with that angle the diffraction angle be calculate by subtract the reference angle of 183.5 o 5 from the record value on the scale each reading have an error of 0.5 arcminute so the error in the diffraction angle be simply calculate by add the error in quadrature for the subtraction this meant each diffraction angle have an error of 0.71 arcminute with respect to the sine of the angle this error can be consider negligible a show by the very small error in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8. this emphasis the precision the grate spectrometer can have when take measurement the graph be manipulate such that they pass through the origin because this be a specific value for the datasets and can be record a well a state without error because it occurs at the reference angle for this experiment the wavelength and their error be calculate by multiply the gradient and error by the grate period of 12.69 ¬µm the grate period be take to have no error because it be custom make therefore the only error account for in this calculation result from the angle measurement the red wavelength be calculate a 656.1 ¬± 2.7 nm this be closely align with the accepted value of 656.3nm within experimental uncertainty the aqua wavelength be calculate a 490.8 ¬± 3.4 nm 486.1 nm be the accepted value and the calculate value do n't agree with this experimentally but this be only a slight difference the blue wavelength be calculate a 439.8 ¬± 6.0 nm this wavelength coincides with the accepted one of 434.0 nm within the experimental error obtain the position of the lamp be found to have no affect on the position of the line because the slit still accepts a fraction of the light it be found however that the lamp position affected the intensity of the light with a reduction if it be far away therefore if it be n't a close a possible to the slit the line at great order may not have be visible a likely cause for an error in the wavelength be the calibration of the spectrometer the fact that the anticlockwise direction have more observable order suggests the diffraction pattern be n't symmetric about our reference point this mean the calibration of the instrument ca n't have be correct and the light may have hit the grate surface at an angle that be n't the normal this be highlight by the modulus value of the diffraction angle for each order in table i the symmetry appear to get bad a the wavelength decrease fig 6. a linear relationship be show between the sine of the diffraction angle and the order this red photon give the steepest gradient out of the three photon with a value of 0.05170 ¬± 0.00021 and this corresponds to how the absolute value of the error for the wavelength also increase a wavelength decrease to improve in this case a great grate period could be use a although less order would be present the same number should still be record-able the pattern would also be more symmetric because the angle of each order would be much more similar a far extension of this would have be to check the symmetry before take measurement by verify if it be calibrate correctly the air pressure humidity and temperature affect the record of the wavelength in a systematic way because when the each of these value increase the air in the room becomes less vacuum like the increase in pressure mean the pressure be n't exactly that of a vacuum increase in the number of water molecule in the air mean that the area be n't a deplete of matter so the air be less of a vacuum furthermore by the gay-lussac law the great temperature result in the pressure be great too such that it be less vacuum like 9 all of this mean the refractive index be great than that of a perfect vacuum so the speed of the light be less result in a reduce wavelength in this case the wavelength be n't less but actually slightly great therefore this must n't be a significant contributor to the variation of wavelength to their accepted value a likely systematic error would be that of the grate period it may not be exactly a state but actual more therefore the wavelength be calculate a be great than they should be in addition to this the separation may not be perfectly uniform and so wavelength would of course appear to be slightly different this would require a test of the diffraction grate value use a know wavelength for a monochromatic light by the same method a this experiment the calculate wavelength for each photon emission be related to their respective emission level use the balmer series it be evident that the red photon occur by an electron drop from a low energy level than the others equation 7 show this a it 's clear a large wavelength cause a small energy change therefore it could be conclude that the respective energy level state be 3 for h-‚Üµ 4 for h-fig 8. this linear relationship have the shallowest gradient of the three photon of 0.03466 ¬± 0.00047 because it have the great energy and therefore the small wavelength and 5 for h- the reciprocal of the wavelength be plot against the change in the reciprocal of the square of the energy level to give a straight line in fig 9. the covariance matrix for this plot could not be calculate because there be only three point however the line clearly illustrates the linear relationship present where the gradient be the negative of the rydberg constant a predict by equation 8. the rydberg constant be calculate by consider each of the three value of the constant from the three wavelength a independent value that can form a normal distribution with a mean and standard error use equation 9. the rydberg value be found to have an average of 10 890 000 ¬± 40 000 m 1 this meant the rydberg constant calculate can be state a 10 890 000 ¬± 40 000 m 1 the value deduce for the rydberg constant do not agree with the accepted value of 10 973 731.6 m 1 this be only ever so slightly a the percentage difference be 0.77 this would suggest that the experiment be very accurate a it only differs from the accepted value slightly however within experimental uncertainty it be do n't therefore there be likely to be a small systematic error this error would have occur in the measurement take for the wavelength if the fourth colour be observe the experiment would have be well a the precision would be great because fig 9. there be a linear trend between the change in the reciprocal of the energy level square the slope be define a the negative of the rydberg constant the dash line be that of the actual constant and the solid one be the experimental one so it be evident there be a systematic error because the experimental value be shallower and therefore less than the accepted value the error be less and the linear relationship would have be verify more strongly the fact that there be only four point that be visible be still very little therefore a way in which the experiment can be improve to allow for more data point in the final plot be to record wavelength that be n't visible a method for this would be to use a uv-meter this would allow not only the uv-light in the balmer series to be detect but the uv-light in the lyman series the rydberg constant be deduce a 10 890 000 ¬± 40 000 m 1 this be a very precise result with a small percentage error of 0.40 it only deviate from the accepted value by 0.77 and this be most likely due to a small systematic error it be show that the grate spectrometer be effective in study the spectrum of light the proportional relationship between the sine of diffraction angle and their order be consistently verify this allow precise and accurate wavelength of h-‚Üµ h-and h-to be calculate a 656.1 ¬± 2.7 nm 490.8 ¬± 3.4 nm and 439.8 ¬± 6.0 nm respectively a clear success for this experiment be the use of the spectrometer because recording be take efficiently and precisely with the main and vernier scale despite this successful usage the setup could definitely be improve with well calibration to ensure that the pattern be symmetric about order 0. furthermore extra investigation could be carry out to estimate the magnitude of the potential systematic error an adaptation to the experiment would involve increase the number of wavelength obtain so that the experiment have less spread the use of a uv-meter would enable more line to be record the repetition of the experiment in a glass chamber would ensure the area be a close to a vacuum a possible allow great accuracy for the wavelength value the grate spectrometer be a sufficient device for deduce the rydberg constant and it be effective in produce precise result the combination of many theory like quantum and wave-particle duality result in the rydberg constant meaning it be a vital constant in explain the model of the atom,deep,bal

85,GS_OXY643_Redacted,he rydberg constant be one of the most important constant of atomic physic because of it connection with the fundamental atomic constant e h me c and because of the high accuracy with which it can be determine 1 the aim of this experiment be to produce a measurement for the rydberg constant use a pasco precision spectrometer this involve diffract light from a hydrogen discharge lamp connect to a power supply through a diffract grate the light produce by the lamp consists of photon with quantize wavelength correspond to the difference in the energy between the initial and final energy state of the atom the diffraction grate with a fix grate space cause these wavelength to spread out at angle with wavelength dependence to produce emission line spectrum which be visible through a telescope this set up enable u to determine the quantize wavelength from which we could then determine the rydberg constant the constant appear most notably in the bohr model of the atom to put it simply niels bohr postulate that the energy of an atom can take only certain value for which he won the nobel prize in 1922. when a photon of a particular energy be eject from an atom he found that the energy of the atom decrease by the same amount he reason that this be an atom make a transition to a low energy level with the energy of the photon equate the energy difference in the internal energy state of the initial and final state from the emission line spectrum he be able to deduce that many different wavelength be emit which correspond to the different transition between energy level in an atom and that the wavelength produce be unique to different element these transition be best described by electron transfer from a specific stable energy orbit about the nucleus of an atom to a low one because the same element produce the same emission line he be able to also determine that it be not possible for there to exist an atom in an energy state that be intermediate to two adjacent energy level the constant appear in the rydberg formula which calculates the theoretical wavelength that will be emit by an atom when it transition to a low energy level the hydrogen wavelength in the bohr model be give by where ùúÜ be the wavelength of the emit photon s ùëõ be the initial energy state of the atom ùëù be the final energy state of the atom and ùëÖ

in the balmer series be know by observation we can determine the initial energy state the atom be in prior to the emission of the photon for 2. because the centre of the fringe be judged by the person look through the telescope there be an error in the angle of the angular width of the fringe the gradient of this linear graph be 5.18e-2m ¬± 0.06e-4m where the error in the gradient be obtain from

error bar which lead to an improve error of ¬± 5 √ó 10 4 m -1 for r‚àû for the red light a value of r‚àû record be 1.129√ó 10 7 ¬± 8 √ó 10 4 m -1 with the wavelength be record a 6.38 √ó 10 -7 ¬± 8 √ó

the correct error on the value of r‚àû be 9 √ó 10 4 only slightly high than the previous error combine all the datasets to find the average value of the rydberg constant across all of the wavelength in the balmer spectrum give a value of 1.112 √ó 10 7 ¬± 1.3 √ó 10 5 m -1 there be a 0.99 error but the percentage difference be 1.34 it be this discrepancy that motivate far error analysis to see where the error be be underestimated which be found to be the lack of incorporation of the error bar in the python function use a state previously correct this an error of ¬± 140,000 to two significant figure lead to a percentage error of 1.26 this be still low than expect but this discrepancy be likely due to the lack of far repeat data set another source of error which may contribute to the discrepancy be the accidental adjustment of the apparatus which could have misalign the collimator grate or the vernier scale the width of the spectral line depend on the width of the slit and focus of the collimator this be adjust until the line be a thin a possible without become difficult to view in the eyepiece there be a random error when align the telescope on the rotational axis because the cross hair may lie on a slightly different position with each measure spectral line estimation must be use to far increase the accuracy of the random error on r‚àû the error on the thickness of the spectral line can be approximate to ¬± 15 arcminute since the width of the spectral line be about 30 arcminute the error on the misalignment of the spectrometer be estimate to be ¬± 5 arcminute incorporate this into the error on the final value of r‚àû give an error of ¬± 1.6 √ó 10 5 m -1 which give a percentage error of 1.42 which encompasses the actual value grate spectroscopy a a method be able to calculate a very precise value of the rydberg constant even though bohr 's theory of the atom which be assume in section ii do n't give a full explanation of the energy level of all atom it do give a very accurate prediction for the energy level of a hydrogen atom the high precision of the method use suggests the error and lack of far precision be not due to the method but due to other factor the vernier scale use be also very precise which suggests the unaccounted for error be human error with the most likely source be the accidental readjustment of the apparatus while take reading overall the experiment be carry out well with a fairly accurate value of the rydberg constant be calculate a intend the formula discover by rydberg and balmer be use once the wavelength

rydberg formula spectroscopy be the study of electromagnetic spectrum which be the wavelength composition of light due to atomic and molecular interaction a grate spectrometer us a diffract grate to disperse the incident polychromatic light into it constituent monochromatic component 3 in this experiment the emission spectrum of hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the rydberg formula explains the relation between the transition wavelength and the energy level with the proportionality constant be the rydberg constant the information about the wavelength of the emission spectrum be use to deduce the rydberg constant the word spectrum be first apply by isaac newton to describe the rainbow of colour that combine to form white light during the early 1800s joseph von fraunhofer conduct experiment with dispersive spectrometer that enable spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique 4 since then spectroscopy have become important in the study of physic and it be equally crucial in the astronomical biological chemical metallurgical and other analytical investigation 3 figure 2.0 show the electromagnetic spectrum of light that range from radio wave to gamma ray correspond to their wavelength 8 the electromagnetic spectrum can be anything from long infrared all the way down to gamma ray a show by figure 2.0. the light might have originate from anything from a cool crystal to a superhot plasma or from a star 1 the light spectrum generally take one of two form firstly hot solid such a a tungsten lamp filament emits a continuous spectrum of intensity that vary with wavelength secondly hot or electrically excite gas release spectrum that have concentrate emission at a few well-defined wavelength a see from the slit of the spectrometer a show by figure 2.1. this form be call 'emission line spectrum the ratio of intensity of spectral line for example can provide information about the density of the emit gas or the density of the free electron in an electrical discharge since the spectroscopy be a `` non-invasive '' technique it be one of the most powerful tool available to physicist 1 figure 2.1. show the emission spectrum of various element these line have well define position which correspond to well-defined wavelength 9 these gas also show 'absorption line spectrum which occurs when a continuous white light be pass through their cool state instead of emit spectral line the gas absorb the well-defined wavelength of light and reemit in random direction result in dark line in a continuous spectrum a see in figure 2.2 2 however the focus of the experiment will be on the emission line spectrum of hot hydrogen lamp determine the rydberg constant use the grate spectrometer the absorption spectrum of helium with well-defined dark line on the continuous spectrum of white light 10 a spectrometer need a dispersive object to disperse or separate the different wavelength of the incident light spatially 3 in our experiment we use a diffraction grate diffraction be a wave phenomenon that occurs when a wave encounter an obstacle or a slit 2 a grate can be consider a a large n of equally space very narrow slit 1 each slit be separate by a distance d 1 where m be the order number 1,2 here m take value of 0 1 and 2. in this experiment the value at the opposite direction take negative value such -1 and -2. the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen be divide into a number of spectral series spectral emission occurs when an electron transition from a high energy state to a low energy state to differentiate the two state the low energy state be designate a p and the high energy state be designate a n. since the energy of each state be fix the energy difference between the state be fix and the transition will always produce a photon with the same energy 5 hydrogen atom correspond to the wavelength of the photon emit 13 this experiment focus on balmer series since lyman series and paschen series do not involve photon that lie in the visible range so the value of p in this case be 2. the energy difference between level and hence the wavelength of emit photon be give by the rydberg formula 5 where r‚àû be the rydberg constant which have the measure value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 it can be express in term of more fundamental constant a where me be the mass of electron c be the speed of light h be plank 's constant and Œ± be the fine structure constant the value of 1/Œ± ‚âà 137.036 1,6 before proceed to make measurement the spectrometer be first properly alinged and focus firstly the eyepiece be focus on the cross wire `` x '' to find a set that do not strain the eye the instrument be brought outside the work space to a window the camera lens be focus so that a distant object be focus on the cross wire the distant object chosen be another window across the street since the distant in this context mean 5 to 10 metre 1 the telescope be set so that it be alinged with the axis of the collimator the hydrogen lamp be position close to the slit so that it be illuminate without change the camera focus the focus of the collimator be adjust until a sharp image of the slit be focus at the cross wire the slit be adjust to it minimum width and the cross wire be set a an `` x '' rather than a a `` '' it be checked how the clamp screw and the slow motion drive work the camera and collimator be alinged so the cross wire be set on the slit image the telescope be move through precisely 90 deg by note the intial and final position on the vernier scale and clamped in position a mirror be put in the holder and the ruling be ensure approximately vertical the grate table that hold the mirror be turn until a reflect image of the slit be observe in the eyepiece this indicates the grate surface be at 45 deg to the incident from the collimator the height of this image be adjust use the adjustment screw under the grate table the reading be note the grate be rotate through precisely 45 degree use the scale so that it be accurately set at 0 deg normal incidence the mirror be replace with a grate slit the telescope be then move out of the way and look into the grate the telescope be move around to find the diffract image of the slit if the image be above or below the plane define by the cross wire the grate adjustment screw be use to rotate the grate in the plane of it surface until the image be at right height the spectrometer be now set up to make measurement the hydrogen lamp be only switch on whenever the measurement be go to be make since it get hots and the intensity of the emission line drop until they be not visible in the eyepiece the grate slit that have 78.8 line per mm 1 be chosen since it show more emission line up to 3 order number the hydrogen lamp be turn on and the diffract image be observe in the eyepiece the position of the centre of the diffration pattern be measure here the centre represent the zeroth order in the grate equation i.e eq 2.2. the first order m=1 of emission line be observe in the first order one of the emission line look red and it position be record the step above be repeat for the second and third order and the order in the opposite direction the second visible wavelength be blue the position of the blue emission line be measure in the same manner a red 's the third visible emission line look bluish purple however the intensity of the third emission line be very low so the grate slit be change to another one with 300 line per mm 1 which provide high resolution but only the first and second order can be observe my partner and i take reading of the position of the same line alteratively to get a value for the uncertainty in the angle turn Œ∏. the entire measure process be repeat multiple time for the three different emission line to increase the accuracy all reading be record on the lab book and then transfer to the computer to be analyse eq 2.2 implies a plot of the sin Œ∏ vs. m will yield a straight line a plot of sin Œ∏ a a function of m be plot on python for each transition wavelength use the information about the slope the wavelength of each emission line be determine with their uncertainty for each wavelength the rydberg constant be deduce with it uncertainty the plot of sin Œ∏ vs. m be plot on python for each transition wavelength the slope of the plot from figure 4.3 be 0.1294¬±0.0008 the d use be 3.33 √ó 10 -6 m. this be different from those use for previous plot since the grate slit be change for well resolution the wavelength of the emission line obtain be 4.3¬±0.1 √ó 10 -7 m. the error in the angle of the emission line Œ∏ for each transition wavelength be calculate from the standard deviation of the data the error in the wavelength for purple emission line be increase to 0.1√ó10 -7 m from a very small error since the intensity of the line be very low i suspect the error be big than the value obtain from standard deviation in summary the transition wavelength be give on the table below by compare the colour observe with the figure 2.6 the result be very similar visually but the second emission line be actually aqua light blue and the third one be blue not purple apart from that the wavelength do correspond to the colour observe in figure 2.6. also the forth emission line violet which be suppose to be visible be not observe this could be due to low intensity of the hydrogen lamp provide the rydberg constant r‚àû be calculate for each transition wavelength by use eq 2.3. since the spectral line on balmer series be of the visible wavelength the wavelength obtain from the experiment correspond to the balmer series therefore the value of p energy level of the final level in this experiment be 2. the result be summarise by the table below colour n Œª 10 -7 m r‚àû 10 the average of the value of r‚àû obtain be 1.10¬±0.04 √ó 10 7 m -1 the percentage difference when compare to the measure value be 0.2 the measure value also lie within the range of the average 1.06,1.14 √ó 10 7 m -1 the error in the average be relatively large thus result in a large range however the measure value be very close to the average there be a few possible source of error which could have affected the final result for example the hydrogen lamp get hot and the intensity drop make it difficult to spot the line we also change the lamp for a few time and the position of the lamp might have be change sometimes the whole set up be move by accident which could have cause the set up to be misalingned hence a set up fix to table must be use with a well long last hydrogen lamp even though the experiment be carry out in a dark room there be table lamp on our neighbour table which could have affected the incident light into the diffraction grate therefore an opaque shield should be use to cover it leave a hole for the eyepiece besides the grate holder could have be move during the change of the grate slit the temperature and humidity be possible error source too since they can affect the system optic 3 therefore the temperature and humidity should be monitor and regulate during the experiment the emission spectrum produce by hot hydrogen be study use a grate spectrometer the visible transition wavelength which lie on balmer series be observe and measure the rydberg constant r‚àû which relates the energy level in the atom to the transition wavelength be calculate the value of r‚àû obtain be 1.10¬±0.04 √ó 10 7 m -1 when compare to the measure value of 10 973 731.6 m -1 the percentage difference be 0.2 the result be what we expect this also verifies the rydberg formula i.e eq 2.3. it should be note that the grate spectrometer be highly accurate and the lab script claim to give a precision of ¬±0.2nm for the wavelength of yelloworange light if repeat measurement be take 1 since the small error in Œª we can achieve be ¬±4nm we be still a long way from reach the uncertainty of ¬±0.2nm therefore the experiment should be repeat multiple time with more careful procedure consider the step discuss in the previous section apart from that this experiment only investigates the visible transition wavelength of hydrogen i.e balmer series the other spectral line such a those from lyman series and paschen series should be study and be use to determine the rydberg constant a they be also related to it by eq 2.3 5 besides hydrogen any hydrogen-like element can be use to determine r‚àû too 5",extended,bal

give the resolution ‚àÜl and wavelength difference between the two light ‚àÜŒª classify a a g-type main-sequence star the sun be know to contain an abundance of hydrogen and helium 8 in the center

burning certain elemental salt in a candle flame and examine the light produce the composition of the sun can be analyse if an element produce the emission spectral line which match an absorption spectral line see in the fraunhofer line it can be conclude the sun contains say element for the purpose of this experiment it can be see that the atmosphere of the sun contains sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen the experimental set-up be divide into two phase calibration and data collection with reference to figure 6 the eyepiece crosswire camera lens be brought into focus on a distant object the telescope and collimator be then brought into alignment and the hydrogen lamp use a the source the focus of the spectrometer be then adjust until a sharp image of the zeroth order spectral

be in the same order of magnitude a the theoretical value the relative difference be which be great than 10 and not reliable out of the four salt test iron filing and copper sulfate do not produce an emission spectrum sodium chloride produce yellow spectral line in correspondence to fraunhofer designation d and magnesium oxide produce red spectral line in correspondence to fraunhofer designation a a see in figure 5. qualitatively the experiment successfully capture the four spectral line h-alpha h-beta h-gamma and hdelta in the balmer series quantitatively the experiment determine the rydberg constant to a relative difference with the establish literature of 2 since the relative difference be small than 10 the experiment be consider consistent with theory these result be significant a they verify the emission spectral line associate with hydrogen which be commonly found in ionize interstellar hydrogen know a h ii region in astrophysics a nasa photograph of the orion nebula confirms this observation a show in figure 10. although the experimental value for resolution be determine to the same order of magnitude a the theoretical value the relative difference be large than 10 and hence be consider unreliable this inaccuracy of result could be due to an oversimplification in theory which do not account for how the spectrometer and it lens could contribute to an overall resolution this observation be back up by two fact firstly the theory predict that the pair of doublet in sodium lamp should merge into one when in fact one of the doublet simply disappear secondly both doublet disappear together when the source be a hydrogen lamp which should not happen accord to the theory this meant a more sophisticated theory accounting for the spectrometer 's contribution in resolution along with an increase care take during experiment would be necessary for future improvement figure 10 an astronomical photo of the orion nebula with easily identifiable h-alpha and h-delta spectral region locate in the center with h-beta and h-gamma region locate in the fringe 11 fraunhofer line refer to the fraunhofer line see in figure 5 it could be postulate that the solar composition contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen take an abridge table from a paper publish by the araa annual review of astronomy and astrophysics a see in figure 11 it could be see that the postulate be in fact correct figure 11 a breakdown of solar atmosphere composition show that the sun do contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen 12 iron filing do not produce a temperature a it melt point 1500 ‚Ä¢ c be great than the temperature of the candle 1400 ‚Ä¢ c although copper sulfate may have produce a green emission spectrum it be unclear whether if the result be due to a contamination of the candle flame hence the experimenter decide to err on the side of caution and discard the result for copper sulfate overall the experiment be consider consistent with theoretical prediction since the four spectral line predict by the theory be observe and rydberg constant be determine to a relative difference of 2 the result be consistent with theory for grate spectrometer resolution the discrepancy between the experimental resolution and theoretical resolution be too large 66 10 and hence a more careful treatment theoretically and experimentally would be warrant for fraunhofer line the result be consistent with the theory of araa which demonstrate that the sun 's atmosphere contain sodium chlorine magnesium and oxygen hence the primary aim of the experiment be attain whilst the secondary aim
