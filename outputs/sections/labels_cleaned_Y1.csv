0,GS_VJL711_Redacted,since the room be dark and it be hard to read the cramped number on the veriner the angle of diffraction could be measure imprecisely we conclude that this be the major factor that affected the inaccurate rydberg constant there could be various systematic error that affected the result we try to perfectly align the spectrometer but this could be unsuccessful also the position of the lamp should have be a close to the slit a possible since it be directly related to the intensity of the light this could make u see the cyan colour light the air pressure and humidity be also other source but we decide that they be negligible in the experiment we try to measure the rydberg constant use a hydrogen gas tube and a spectrometer and we get 𝑅 ∞ 10.5 × 10 6 ± 4.4 × 10 6 𝑚 −1 which be only 0.4 unit less than the theoretical value however we fail to obtain the precise value a our uncertainty be over 40 percent of our value and we conclude that the width of the slit be not narrow enough to produce the precise result this could be improve by repeat the experiment in a darker room with a narrower slit width and a clearer vernier a for reference this be the code that have be use for data analysis,extended,bal

3,GS_HHM124_Redacted,we initially estimate the error for each measurement base on the difference between our recording and the width of the interference line which be approximately 2 arcminute most of the error be in the range of 3 to 6 arcminute however there be some measurement be the uncertainty range do not cover the same value a the measurement on the opposite side with the opposite order number since this indicate that the error estimation have to be too small i decide to increase the error associate with the two measurement these error get large than i hop but fortunately there be at least three measurement for each colour that be quite accurate the aim of this experiment be to obtain the value of rydberg 's constant the experimental procedure be quite good because we have obtain an accurate value for the constant but there be still some possibility for improvement we should have definitely checked that we have observe the right colour since it turn out that one of the observe one be not come from hydrogen this be not a huge problem since the constant could still be derive from other colour furthermore we could have also minimize other error we could have repeat the calibration until the central interference line would be at exactly 0 degree because probably then we would have also see small difference between the measurement on opposite side the error on the distance between two slit be also probably an overestimation one way to low it would be two use light with know wavelength find it interference patter and calculate the distance between two slit with the associate uncertainty the great strength of the data analysis for this experiment in my opinion be use the sine of angle versus order number graph because it really help to low the uncertainty in the slope and consequently in the rydberg constant,expert,bal

69,GS_IHJ555_Redacted,where 𝜆 be the wavelength r ∞ be the rydberg constant with a measure value of 10973731.6 m -1 n and p be integer represent the energy level n be the initial state and p be the final state 2 by use equation 1 and the theoretical value of the rydberg constant we can calculate the wavelength and predict the colour of the light that we expect to see the light with the long wavelength be emit when electron drop from initial state 3 to final state 2. the wavelength be calculate to be 656 nm use equation 1 and this wavelength fall into the wavelength range for red light therefore the light with the long wavelength we expect to see be red light the grate have a large number of very narrow slit which be equally space the grate equation can be use to determine the wavelength of light where dsinθ be the path difference a show in fig 6 and m be the order number rearrange this equation we get therefore if we plot sinθ vs. m the gradient of the line of best fit of the graph will be the value of since we know the value of d we can calculate the wavelength of the light after determine the wavelength we have all the data we need to calculate the experimental value of rydberg constant use equation 1 fig 6. the path difference between light that go through the grate in this experiment we use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta and the wavelength of the light emit by a hydrogen lamp then calculate the rydberg constant in order to set up the spectrometer we focus the eyepiece and camera and align them with the axis of the collimator we set the cross wire a an `` x '' since it be easy to use this way then we turn the telescope which be the eyepiece and the camera lens through 90 degree and adjust the grate table until a reflect image be see in the eyepiece this mean that the incident beam from the collimator be now at 45 degree to the grate surface a show in fig 7. then we rotate the grate through precisely 45 degree accord to the scale so that it be set at 0 degree to the incident light beam 2 in order to make sure that the spectrum be not inclined we cover the upper and low part of the light source use two piece of tape a show in fig 8 thus the light be shorten and be fit into the cross wire completely a show in fig 9. by do this when we rotate the eyepiece we be allow to check if the spectrum be inclined. left spectrum observe without use tape to shorten them when rotate the telescope can not check if the spectrum be inclined right spectrum observe after use tape to shorten them can check if the emission spectrum be inclined when rotate the telescope we rotate the telescope left and right horizontally until we observe a light and note the value of theta at that position in order to get a value for the uncertainty in theta me and my lab partner both read the value and we estimate that there be an error of ± 1.45 × 10 -4 radian associate with our measurement since both of u read a value of theta for each order we have two value of theta associate with the light since the space between the central maximum and the emit light with the same colour of an order that have the same magnitude should be equal e.g the red emit light of order ± 1 have the same distance from the central maximum the angle theta of the positive and negative order should have the same magnitude therefore we plot the sine of the average value of theta against the magnitude of the order accord to equation 3 the gradient of the line of best fit corresponds to the value of therefore by multiply the gradient by d we determine the wavelength by use equation 1 we can obtain the value of rydberg constant iv error result discussion by use equation 1 and the theoretical value of the rydberg constant we predict that the long wavelength of the light that we could observe be 656 nm this light be create when electron drop from energy level three to energy level two use the standard colour spectrum chart we found that the light with the long wavelength that we could expect to see be the red light refer to equation 1 we need the value of wavelength to determine the rydberg constant accord to equation 3 the graph sinθ vs. m should be a straight line and the gradient of the line of best fit corresponds to the value of by plot the data from table i. we obtain graph 1.0 and graph 2.0. in this experiment the grate we use have 78.8 line per mm therefore the space d be 0.0127 mm the gradient of the line of best fit for the green light be 0.04208 rad/m multiply this value by 0.0127 × 10 -3 m we determine that the wavelength of green light be 535 ± 185 nm similarly we determine the wavelength of red light be 678 ± 185 nm since the wavelength be a function of and a constant d we calculate the error associate with the wavelength by do differentiation formula use be show in appendix rearrange equation 1 for the rydberg constant therefore the rydberg constant be a function of 𝜆 n and p. since n and p be the energy level there be no error associate with them and 2 can be treat a a constant therefore only 𝜆 contributes to the error associate with 𝑅 we determine the error associate with it by do differentiation with respect to 𝜆 formula use be show in appendix we calculate the error associate with the rydberg constant to be ± 28993.5 m -1 for the red emit light and ± 35283.0 m -1 for the green emit light theta θ rad order table i. the value of theta associate with the 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd order red light and green light since there be energy release when electron drop from a high energy state to a low one and energy can be calculate by use where e be the energy h be planck 's constant and f be the frequency also where c be the speed of light 𝜆 be the wavelength combine equation 5 and 6 we get therefore energy be inversely proportional to the wavelength the light with the long wavelength be emit when the least amount of energy be release thus for the red light it initial state be 3 final state be 2. therefore n be equal to 3 and p be equal to 2. by use equation 1 and the wavelength we determine we calculate that the rydberg constant be 10622602.54 ± 28993.5 m -1 for the green light it initial state be 4 final state be 2. therefore we calculate the rydberg constant to be 9978172.747 ± 35283.0 m -1 compare these value with the theoretical value of the rydberg constant 10973731.6 m -1 there be 3.1 difference between the two value for the red emit light and 9.0 between the two value for the green emit light calculation be show in appendix the rydberg constant calculate use the data for the red light be more accurate than the one calculate use data of the green light one of the reason be that during the experiment we notice that the red light be observe to be more focus than the green light therefore we be more likely to get accurate measurement of theta for the red light graph 1.0 sinθ vs. m for the green light graph 2.0 sinθ vs. m for the red light the error associate with the reading of theta be random error it be cause by our judgement to determine this error we read off the theta from the scale alternatively and estimate that the uncertainty associate with the theta we measure be ± 1.45×10 -4 radian there be other source of error that affected our data for example when we observe the light the light be a bit blurry so defocus exist this mean that when we read off the angle the value be not precise also there be background light give that we be not work in a complete dark environment this could have impact on our data because the background light affected our judgement to place the emit light on the same place for each measurement and make it hard for u to observe the light clearly therefore we could not get measurement of theta also since we align the spectrometer manually the equipment could be not in the completely align position a a result of misalignment the value of angle theta we measure could be not accurate v. conclusion by do this experiment we determine the rydberg constant r ∞ which have a measure value of 10973731.6 m -1 to 9978172.747 ± m -1 for the green emit light and 10622602.54 ± m -1 for the red emit light the method use in this experiment be to use a spectrometer to measure the angle theta associate with the emit light for an order m then calculate the wavelength 𝜆 associate with the light via equation 2 together with these data we use equation 1 to calculate the rydberg constant the percent difference between the theoretical value of rydberg constant and the experimental value we obtain be 9.0 for the green emit light and 3.1 for the red emit light calculation be show in appendix this experiment show that one way to determine the rydberg constant be to use a spectrometer during the experiment we measure the data we need without major problem and the final result be relatively close to the theoretical value of r ∞ however we spent a large amount of time do the set-up therefore we fail to complete all the calculation within the time give from this experiment we learnt a way to determine the rydberg constant also we reinforce our knowledge on identify source of error such a defocus misalignment we also have a deeper understand of the importance of preliminary data by take preliminary data we gain some knowledge about the process thus we can take the definitive data more efficiently and accurately appendix formula use in calculate percent difference,expert,the

to say we be look at wavelength of photon generate from an electron transition from a high level n=3,4,5… to energy level p=2 this produce photon in the visible spectrum this can be see in the rydberg formula give by eq 1 where 𝜆 be the wavelength 𝑅 ∞ be the rydberg constant 𝑛 be the energy level high than 2 and 𝑝 be the 2 nd energy level 3 the light in the spectrometer can diffract through a diffraction grate the wavelength of each spectral line can be determine by the diffraction formula give by eq 2 where ⅆ be the distance between the slit in the diffraction grate 𝜃 be the angle at which the order appear in radian 𝑚 be the order at which the spectral line appear where m 0 ±1 ±2 etc and 𝜆 be the wavelength pf the spectral line 4 the central order m =0 will appear at 𝜃 =0 at the central order all the spectral line will be overlap the set up consists of a simple spectrometer with a 78.8 lines/mm diffraction grate and a sodium or hydrogen lamp the set up can be see in fig 1. sodium lamp be use to ready the spectrometer a it produce high intensity light and have a longer operational time than the hydrogen lamp however the sodium lamp do take some time about 2 minute to reach maximum intensity it have a manageable warm up time this overall make the set up of the spectrometer much easy a time can be take to make fine adjustment the disadvantage of use a hydrogen lamp instead of shin light through a vial of vaporise hydrogen and measure an absorption spectrum be that lamp only remains bright enough to make measurement of the low wavelength light for about 10 minute it also only have an operational time of 20 minute this meant that the measurement have to make quickly this however be still more manageable than the alternate method of produce the hydrogen spectrum a the light emit through the hydrogen may have it own spectrum this may lead to confusion when analyse the overall spectrum the sodium lamp be set up in front of the slit and the slit be narrow the intensity of light from the sodium lamp be high and the narrow slit provide a high resolution of the spectral line the resolution be the ability to separate two spectral line and see them discretely the spectral line be then focus use the focus nob the spectral line be ensure to be vertical by place a filter that block some light and turn the line into small dot it be important to ensure that the spectral line be vertical so that the angle measure be in a plane that be perpendicular to the line the filter be make by cut a triangle in a black square card it be position in front of the slit and adjust until the line appear to be dot the filter be then taped on to the slit securely hold it in position the head of the spectrometer be rotate from left to right and we observe if the crosshair pass through the centre of the dot if the crosshair do n't then the stand hold the diffraction grate be adjust use the 3 level screw until it do the filter be then remove a diagram of the filter can be see in fig 2 the diffraction grate be also place such that it be perpendicular to the slit and lens array in front of the lamp preliminary data of the order and angle at which the order appear be make use the sodium lamp here we notice that it be best to make measurement by rotate the head in one direction ie go from m= -4 to m=4 rather than start at the m=0 and change direction after reach the high order this be because change direction occasionally cause the spectrometer to shift a it be not fix to the table finally we replace the sodium lamp with the hydrogen lamp the hydrogen lamp be place such that it be closer to the slit and the centre of the lamp face the slit the centre of the lamp be the brightest part of it the slit be also make to be a bit wider than before this allow more light into the spectrometer a the hydrogen lamp be dimmer than the sodium lamp this however decrease the resolution of the spectral line the spectrometer be refocus and measurement be make first we slowly move from the 0 th order a this be the easy to identify to the -4 th order which we define to be in the clockwise direction then we measure the angle at which the red spectral line appear make sure to keep the crosshair in the centre of the line this be do by use the fine adjustment screw locate on the base we then measure the angle of the subsequent order of the red line until we reach m +4 we then repeat the same technique with the blue and purple line the observe spectral pattern of hydrogen can be see in fig 3 and the data of the angle of each order for each spectral line can be see in appendix a. a see in fig 3 the pattern also contains a rainbow artefact this be due to light from the surround enter the spectrometer if the experiment be do in perfectly dark condition then

85,GS_OXY643_Redacted,he rydberg constant be one of the most important constant of atomic physic because of it connection with the fundamental atomic constant e h me c and because of the high accuracy with which it can be determine 1 the aim of this experiment be to produce a measurement for the rydberg constant use a pasco precision spectrometer this involve diffract light from a hydrogen discharge lamp connect to a power supply through a diffract grate the light produce by the lamp consists of photon with quantize wavelength correspond to the difference in the energy between the initial and final energy state of the atom the diffraction grate with a fix grate space cause these wavelength to spread out at angle with wavelength dependence to produce emission line spectrum which be visible through a telescope this set up enable u to determine the quantize wavelength from which we could then determine the rydberg constant the constant appear most notably in the bohr model of the atom to put it simply niels bohr postulate that the energy of an atom can take only certain value for which he won the nobel prize in 1922. when a photon of a particular energy be eject from an atom he found that the energy of the atom decrease by the same amount he reason that this be an atom make a transition to a low energy level with the energy of the photon equate the energy difference in the internal energy state of the initial and final state from the emission line spectrum he be able to deduce that many different wavelength be emit which correspond to the different transition between energy level in an atom and that the wavelength produce be unique to different element these transition be best described by electron transfer from a specific stable energy orbit about the nucleus of an atom to a low one because the same element produce the same emission line he be able to also determine that it be not possible for there to exist an atom in an energy state that be intermediate to two adjacent energy level the constant appear in the rydberg formula which calculates the theoretical wavelength that will be emit by an atom when it transition to a low energy level the hydrogen wavelength in the bohr model be give by where 𝜆 be the wavelength of the emit photon s 𝑛 be the initial energy state of the atom 𝑝 be the final energy state of the atom and 𝑅 `` be the rydberg constant this relationship know a the rydberg formula satisfies the wavelength emit by many different hydrogen series such a the lyman and brackett series which considers ultraviolet light not just the balmer series but for this experiment we only consider the visible spectrum produce in the balmer series for which 𝑝=2 use classical concept such a the approximate circular orbit of an electron around the atomic nucleus einstein 's photoelectric effect and coulomb 's law it can be show that the rydberg constant be also give by where 𝑚 2 be the mass of an electron 𝑒 be the charge on an electron 𝜀 be the permittivity of free space ℎ be plank 's constant and 𝑐 be the speed of light use the know constant this yield a value of 10973731.6m -1 a the colour produce in the balmer series
