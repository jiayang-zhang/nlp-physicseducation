michelson interferometer a a spectrometer use a silicon pin photodiode detector and measurement program operating on linus o inteferograms be produce fourier transform with method detailed be use to find wavelength the property of the light source be found and discuss white light source be usually found to have shorter coherence length than colour source due to frequency superposition the tungsten lamp exhibit a black-body emission spectrum with a calculate operating temperature of 3420±40k through comparison with expect result and far data limitation in apparatus be discover and where appropriate correct for mercury lamp data displayed a large amount of noise in the reading and thus the detector use be deem unsuitable for the analysis of this emission i nvented in 1880 the michelson interferometer have form an integral part of many scientific discovery and discipline include special relativity spectroscopy and interferometry 1 the simple set up allows for record of the interference of electromagnetic wave a single light source be input and the beam split use a beamsplitter this be follow by beam recombination with the use of two mirror at the detector the movement of one of the two mirror adjusts the path difference between the two light beam this creates interference pattern from which conclusion can be drawn about the source and it constituent frequency a michelson interferometer be built and use to analyze four different type of light source with vary filter these include a green laser two led a mercury lamp and a tungsten lamp the filter use be green and yellow the variation in light production technique and coherence among source allow for analysis of the suitability of this interferometer for different situation a schematic of a michelson interferometer be show in fig 1. when a beam of light be incident on a beamsplitter it be split into two separate beam one reflect one transmit the reflect beam a travel to mirror m1 and back and the transmit beam b travel to mirror m2 and back for the extend source use in this investigation the interference pattern be dependent on the angle θ between the incoming fig 1 a michelson interferometer m1 and m2 be mirror m2 represent equivalent position of m2 in a parallel setup d be the distance between the beamsplitter and closest mirror and t be difference in parallel position of the mirror 2 p.4 ray and the optical axis through basic trigonometric manipulation it can be see that difference in path length φ of the two beam be where t be the difference in length of the interferometer arm a show this path difference cause interference upon beam recombination the principle of linear superposition state constructive interference occurs when φ be an integer multiple of wavelength and complete destructive interference occurs when φ be an integer plus a half wavelength the interference pattern vary with orientation of the mirror if m1 and m2 be at perfect right angle concentric circular ring call haidinger fringe will be see if they be not at right angle symmetry will be broken and straight bright line of uniform thickness form call frizeau fringe the interferometer may be use a a spectrometer when the distance between the two mirror be approximately equal the null point when use monochromatic light this be see a haidinger fringe reduce to a singularity 3 by take measurement close to the null point the coherence length l of a source may be see on an interferogram though a precise definition of coherence length be not give this be the length over which one arm of the michelson interferometer may be scan before the contrast of the interferogram becomes poor the spectral width ∆ν of the source be a measure of the range of frequency emit by the source and be where c be the speed of light and l be in metre spectral width be measure in hz 2 wavelength can be found by fourier transform of the interferogram an electromagnetic wave with electric field strength e may be express in the form where r be the position vector ω be angular frequency and t be time k be the wave vector whose modulus be 2πν where ν be inverse wavelength or wavenumber use euler 's identity the time dependant part of this function may be represent a a summation of trignometric function ie the potential for representation of any function use sine and cosine allows for fourier transform 4 the shape of an interferogram be dependant on the frequency present and the amplitude or intensity of each frequency the intensity of a signal be proportional to the square of it amplitude the interferogram contains all physical information about a wave fourier transform be use to make interferograms directly interpretable though provide no extra information a fourier transform f ω of the interferogram function in the time domain f t be use to represent data in the frequency domain these two function form a fourier transform pair and be related by this fourier transform return both positive and negative frequency the negative frequency be due to contribution from the imaginary part of the wave take an inverse function of positive frequency reconstructs the original wavelength spectrum fourier transform be carry out on a computer use summation over a large but finite number of point n 5 an interferometer be built follow the configuration in fig 1. the two mirror use be a manually adjust kinematic mirror and a motorize mirror adjust through input command in the linus terminal a thorlab 30 mm cage cube-mounted non-polarizing beamsplitter be use manufacturer specification describe a dielectric anti-reflective coat apply face with a great transmission tolerance to wavelength in the 400 -700 nm range the dielectric coat cause a phase change for one beam lead to destructive interference at zero path difference and constructive interference when λ 2 6 the silicon pin photodiode dectector use have a detection range of 400 -1100nm 7 light source be mount on a v-clamp depend on the intensity of the light source plano-convex lens of focal length 24.5 and 100.0mm be insert between source and beamsplitter to widen beam and between beamsplitter and detector to refocus the alignment of the interferometer be checked and adjust use green laser light point beam be project onto a screen place in front of the detector and the kinematic mirror move until fizeau fringe be see a magnify lens be then insert and the motorize mirror adjust until a minimum of haidinger fringe be see a white light source be then insert and an interferogram take the peak of this interferogram be indicative of a null point at the position −0.6663 ± 0.0005mm and all subsequent data be take in a 100µm range about this point the velocity of the motorize mirror be set to 0.5µms −1 theoretical calculation use the nyquist theorem 4 of the minimum speed imply a much great speed may be use however a the oscillation record by the interferogram do not form perfect sine wave many more than two data point per oscillation be necessary to ensure complete information the velocity of the mirror be also slow to reduce beating between frequency present beating be a result of the superposition of the two interference pattern this beating form an envelop function that corrupt the data follow collection of data interferograms be plot and gaussian fit overlaid the coherence length be deduce to be roughly equal to the full width half maximum of the gaussian curve and from this spectral width calculate where appropriate mean wavelength be found use a similar gaussian-overlay method on the fourier transform and estimate the mean value in case where this be not possible a value be estimate use visual approximation fourier transform spectroscopy approximates light source a point source in many case this be a good approximation however it would be beneficial to insert a small aperture between the source and the beamsplitter fig 2 show an example interferogram table 1 show key result relate to property of light source error be usually calculate through visual estimation of goodness of fit where wavelength be a single value this be the mean wavelength take at peak spectral intensity and error be the standard deviation approximate through a gaussian fit for the blue lead it be possible to computationally fit a gaussian function this produce a covarence matrix from which error parameter be found where wavelength be a range of value this be the range over which there be high spectral intensity error on the coherence length of the white lead be high due to the presence of a secondary gaussian envelope function on the interferogram error on the coherence length of unfiltered tungsten be high due minimal peak in the secondary gaussian lead to highly subjective fitting of the gaussian overlay the coherence length for the mercury lamp be not present due to excessive noise in data no data be take for unfiltered mercury this would be beneficial a a comparative tool the range of wavelength detect whilst use green and yellow filter on the tungsten and mercury lamp be surpasses what be expect for the respective light range despite this clear cut off frequency be demonstrate by the sharp depreciation in spectral intensity at the edge of the allow range a show in fig 4. far discussion on filter be in present in section 4b the white lead exhibit two peak of wavelength a show in fig 3 with wavelength document in table 1. this be indicative of the lead be make up of a monochromatic light source and fluorescent phosphorous coat the agreement of wavelength within range of error of the blue peak of the white lead and the blue lead imply similar source be use when look at the white lead the light emit be obviously non-uniform imply vary thickness in the phosphorus coat a ground glass diffuser be add between the source and beamsplitter in an attempt to minimize this inconsistency and blend frequency despite this when compare interferograms of the light with and without the diffuser no significant change be see it would be beneficial to reduce the aperture of the incident white light use a pin hole to ensure uniformity the coherence length of colour source be see to be large than for white light in most case this be due to the extensive superposition of multiple wave of different frequency a show by large spectral width for white light source many frequency be superimpose to contribute to the final pulse on the interferogram a the number of contribute frequency to a source tends to infinity the resultant pulse of intensity in the time domain narrow the tungsten lamp produce a black body emission spectrum partially show in fig 5 with a peak at 845 ± 10nm use wien 's displacement law where t be absolute temperature of the source the temperature of the tungsten lamp be found to be 3420 ± 40k this value be outside the range expect 2500 -3300 k however it be important to note that the nature of emission of a blackbody mean wavelength deep into the infrared will be emit and will give rise to intensity peak outside of the detector 's sensitivity so this peak in intensity in the visible zone should be treat with some skepticism 8 the majority of discharge of a mercury lamp be in the ultraviolet zone 10 and thus not picked up by the detector this be due to the de-excitation of electron from quantize energy level cause highly energetic photon emission emission in the visible zone be weak and thus highly susceptible to noise when record this be demonstrate by fig 4a data take for mercury be include however should be treat with caution for this reason the expect presence of a doublet under the cut of frequency be demonstrate by sharp decrease in spectral intensity however be different to those expect from manufacturer specification 9 yellow filter be not distinguishable a more sensitive detector be necessary for accurate analysis of mercury emission for low input velocity of the motorize mirror the motion of the mirror be not constant a the input velocity use be 0.5µs −1 the expect positional change between sample be 0.001µm through analysis of a data set of 43422 measurement the mean positional deviation be found to be 1.02 ± 0.64 × 10 −2 µm the error on this result be the standard deviation in addition to this large standard deviation the stage do not move between reading in 4.46 of case this lack of movement demonstrates the lack of suitability of the motorize mirror extensive analysis of light source the inconsistent motion of the mirror may have result in false peak of spectral intensity the beamsplitter use be coat in an anti-reflection coat state to transmit between 40 and 55 of incident light in the wavelength range 400-700nm below this range percentage transmission decay exponentially however above there be a gradual roughly linear decrease the lack of equality between reflection and transmission of wave will effect interference pattern the resultant effect in the fourier transforms have be ignore however quantify resultant error would be beneficial the spectral sensitivity s of the detector be a function of wavelength this lead to a skewed weight and bias towards longer wavelength in the final wavelength fourier transforms of the interferograms through manual fitting of the manufacturer publish graph of spectral sensitivity against wavelength 7 it be possible to approximate the function to where f w be an inverse quadratic function of wavelength w the technique use to fit the curve be estimate through visual analysis to have an error of ±5 by multiply the fourier transform wavelength spectrum by this function intensity be alter to demonstrate 'true experimental situation this be demonstrate in fig 3 where fig 3a be the spectral intensity prior to correction and fig 3b be the spectral intensity after the large range of wavelength show in fig 4 for both the mercury and tungsten lamp be not wholly indicative of the presence of a yellow filter the filter use be thorlab uv/vis bandpass laser line filter the manufacturer specification state a tolerance of 500 − 590 ± 2nm for yellow light the rejection of wavelength outside this range be state to be 99.9 the state lifetime of the filter be two year due to break down of a component dielectric 9 far information be require on the age of the filter to determine the extent this contributes to error in result v. conclusion a michelson interferometer have be create use standard laboratory equipment various light source have be analyze and equipment suitability assess for this line of investigation whilst high quality interferograms have be create and use to find wavelength coherence length and spectral width of light high error be present limitation in various apparatus affect result and reduce precision the filter use have a great tolerance than expect and the motorize mirror have inconstant motion for the mercury lamp weak emission in the range of visible light result in error too great for exact analysis coherence length have be found to be great for colour light source and the reason understood in the majority of case emission have reflect know result within boundary of error far investigation should be undertaken with more suit equipment to fully ass inaccuracy approximation in calculation of wavelength should be far minimize and a wider range of light source and filter analyze,prediction,the

10,2ndINT_XUQ367_Redacted,a white lead be make from a blue lead with a yellow phosphor therefore 2 gaussian distribution should be observe from the fourier transform the interferogram of the white lead be asymmetrical due to misalignment of the interferometer this can affect the result but not to a substantial degree of accuracy the spectrum show two spectral line that be in a gaussian distribution the peak wavelength of the blue spectral line be 445.3 ± 0.2nm with a standard deviation of 10.4 ± 0.2nm and the peak wavelength of the yellow phosphor spectral line be 562.8 ± 0.2nm with a standard deviation of 55.5 ± 1nm the latter spectral line be just above the boundary of the yellow-green spectrum so can therefore be except a a non anomalous result the value be obtain by use computer optimisation that also return value for the uncertainty in peak wavelength the mean wavelength of the whole lead be calculate by use amplitude a a weight factor in the mean which be calculate to be 506.8±0.5nm the standard deviation be use to calculate the spectral width meaning that δλ= 24.5 ± 0.9 for the blue part of the spectrum and δλ= 103.7 ± 1nm for the yellow part of the spectrum this give a combine δλof 128.2±2nm from 4 we calculate δνto be 121.0±1thz then use 3 the coherence length be calculate to be 2.48 ± 0.01 μm next we analyse the blue lead the interferogram and fourier transform be show in figure 4 and 5 respectively the blue lead have a gaussian peak at 470.1±0.1nm with a standard deviation of 20.3 ± 0.1nm this meant that the δλfor the blue lead be 20.3 ± 0.1 result in a value for δνto be calculate at 27.5 ± 0.3thz therefore the coherence length be 5.36 ± 0.9μm we analyse the tungsten light source with a green filter and a yellow filter the interferogram for the green filter tungsten light be show below the interferogram pattern show in figure 6 be due to the nature of the filter the green filter transmits light in gaussian form with a peak wavelength of 543.5 ± 2nm with a standard deviation of 4.2 ± 0.8nm 4 this mean that the result interferogram be a resultant of a convolution with the filter and the tungsten light source from figure 7 we fit a single gaussian curve and two separate gaussian curve the peak wavelength of the single gaussian curve be found to be 539.9 ± 1.2nm and the mean wavelength of the two gaussian curve be found to be 542.5 ± 1.1nm the two mean wavelength be similar so it be possible that these two peak be due to a small misalignment that cause the interferogram of the white light it could also be cause by distance between sample take be too large this be also cause the single gaussian peak to have a small amplitude a all the point be use in the optimisation however the amplitude do not affect the mean wavelength for the single peak the mean wavelength from the two gaussian peak would leave out the dip in the fourier transform therefore if we assume that the dip be an anomalous result the mean wavelength of 542.5 ± 1nm would be more accurate from use the two gaussian peak a our accepted result the spectral width be found to be 55.9 ± 0.2thz use 5 we obtain a value of 5.36 ± 0.12μm the result for the tungsten light with the yellow filter be show below the interferogram for the tungsten light source with the yellow filter have a similar shape to the tungsten light source with the green filter for the same reason again a single gaussian fit do not seem appropriate but from analysis of the other two curve the mean wavelength be calculate to be 577.4 ± 1nm the spectral width be calculate to be 65.5 ± 0.2thz which obtains a coherence length of 4.58 ± 0.18μm the error give for the tungsten light source for the wavelength be give by the fit for the curve however these error may not be the true value of the error a the two peak fit for the tungsten light source be not a accurate a the other fit for the white lead and blue lead the final light source that be observe and scan around the null point be the mercury discharge lamp the interferogram do not have a distinct gaussian peak this be due to the fact that mercury lamp have many spectral line two different curve be fit to the spectrum of the mercury lamp to investigate the appearance of a doublet in 500-600nm part of the mercury lamp spectrum the initial parameter of the optimisation be change in order to identify any doublet however the mercury spectral line be not distinct which make it difficult to identify the doublet from the curve fit with two peak the mean wavelength be calculate to be 512.2 ± 0.8nm with a δλof 54.4 ± 0.7nm therefore the spectral width be calculate to be 5.99 ± 0.7thz with a coherence length of 5.01 ± 0.5μm.it be know that mercury emits light in the uv spectrum despite this no light be detect in the uv range this be because the photometer detects light within a certain range of wavelength this be discuss far in the appendix concern the derivation of the fourier transform,extended,the

yellow filter and a green laser be use within the interferometer to obtain interferograms from the interferograms the spectral width be calculate and compare with the theoretical relationship that a great spectral width corresponds to a longer coherence length the michelson interferometer be an experimental device which utilises interference to measure wavelength and fringe separation with great precision on the order of several nanometre it be first use in the michelson-morley experiment to attempt to measure the relative motion of earth to the ethera hypothesise medium for electromagnetic wave 1 this laid the foundation which eventually lead to the first detection of gravitational wave in 2015 by ligo 2 the setup of the michelson interferometer be relatively simple give the level of precision the interferometer consists of two mirror a beam splitter with an attach dielectric plate a source of monochromatic wave and a detector the mirror m2 be fix while mirror m1 be mount on a moveable stage which can be move towards or far away from the beam splitter the beam splitter be compose of a glass plate with a silver surface the silver surface cause the incident ray from the source to be split into two beam one beam pass through towards m2 while the other be reflect towards m1 the two beam be reflect by their respective mirror and recombine once again at the beam splitter before be measure by the detector the dielectric plate cause a phase shift of the beam go towards b by λ/2 the two beam will recombine accord to the principle of superposition since both beam originate from the same monochromatic and coherent source interference will occur when the beam be in phase and the peak of one beam coincides with the peak of the other constructive interference will occur when in antiphase the peak of one beam will be counteract by the trough of the other cause destructive interference the phase difference between the two beam which be reflect off the mirror m1 and m2 will depend on the distance between m1 and the beam splitter m2 be the position of m1 which would be equidistant from the beam splitter a m2 this be refer to a the null point which be when t 0 where t be the distance between m1 and m2 when t be equal to zero or an integer multiple of λ constructive interference would be expect at the detector while if t be equal to an odd integer multiple of λ/2 destructive interference would be expect to be see however due to the dielectric plate on the beam splitter the opposite be see so that destructive interference occurs when there be no path difference constructive interference corresponds to a bright fringe while destructive interference corresponds to a dark fringe the light source be use throughout this experiment can be consider a extend source due to the width of the incident ray laser source be use in conjunction with a lens which widens the ray this make the alignment of the interferometer easy a the fringe be more visible the pattern of the fringe depends on the tilt of mirror m2 a extend source be be use interference depends on the angle of the incident ray which strike the mirror some specific angle will lead to path difference which be an integer multiple of λ between consecutive ray if m1 and m2 be perpendicular circular haidinger fringe be visible which be the one present in this experiment if m2 be tilt straight fizeau fringe be present instead michelson interferometer the interferometer can be use a a spectrometer by take measurement around the null point for a single monochromatic wave from the source the detector would measure a series of bright and dark fringe if the light source be compose of two or more distinct wavelength then the record output would not be a simple series of fringe for example beating be present in the interferogram when there be two distinct wavelength the two distinct wavelength also correspond to two distinct frequency depend on the frequency the interferogram for each single frequency will be slightly different both will display a maximum at the null point and a series of oscillation between maximum and minimum which be symmetrical around the null point however the distance between subsequent maximum will be different depend on the wavelength or frequency a high frequency lead to a shorter distance between the maximum since there be two distinct frequency the distance between the maximum of one of the frequency and the maximum of the other be change a measurement be take far from the null point however the two maximum will coincide at several point include the null point when this happens the interferogram of both combine will display an intensity that be at a maximum point in between these maximum will show a decrease to a minimum before increase in intensity until the next maximum the distance between the maximum on the interferogram be determine by the difference in frequency of the two wave a small difference in frequency lead to a great distance a the maximum of the separate wave will coincide less often the incoming source of the michelson interferometer can be represent with an electromagnetic spectrum graph the distinct wavelength mention before would be model by a dirac distribution 3 these be also call spectral line a the width of the spectrum be very narrow most source do not have a single spectral line a they have a range of frequency which be present this can be represent by a gaussian distribution which be centre around the frequency which be most prevalent in the source 4 the spectral width of such a source refers to the range of frequency that make up the incident light on the beam splitter the interferogram which be output by the michelson interferometer can be analyse by use fourier transforms this process return the electromagnetic spectrum which show the range of frequency which the source contains however the interferograms be skewed which lead to fourier transforms not be a effective in these case there be formula which can be use to calculate the spectral width of the source where ∆𝜈 be the spectral width in hz l be the coherence length in m and c be the speed light in a vacuum coherence length can be found on the interferogram and be the distance over which the interferometer be effective at scan this can then be convert into a range of wavelength use the follow formula where λ be the mean wavelength in m and ∆𝜆 be the range of wavelength present in the source due to the interferograms be slant the fourier transforms be not a effective at return the mean frequency and spectral width therefore the two above equation can be use to find these two value there be an inverse relationship between the spectral width and the coherence length the narrower the spectral width the broader the coherence length of the interferogram the mean frequency be calculate by use the frequency of the oscillation in the interferogram the simulation follow the theory that a wider spectral width lead to a narrower interferogram the simulation be run use a red laser source although a green one be use when take data the same scale be use for the distance from the null point on the x ax on both fig 4 and fig 5. a simulation of a white light source be also useful so that the predict pattern around the null point be know this give a basis of comparison when attempt to find the null point use a white lead source the interferometer be align use a green laser source and lens which increase the diameter of the light incident on the beam splitter m2 be adjust by use precise screw which tilt the mirror the mirror m2 be tilt until fringe be visible at the output the stage be move by use the linux console there be three parameter which be input into the software for the move stage end point speed of stage and number of measurement the detector have a sample rate of 50 hz which be equivalent to 50 measurement occur every second the beam splitter be securely bolt down so that it move minimally when attach or remove different source however the equipment be extremely sensitive and precise and so the null point constantly shift when change source the interferometer also require realignment at the start of every lab session this alignment take upwards of 40 minute the first time it be attempt a we get more familiar with the equipment this be manage in 10 minute or less the first interferogram be a green laser source it be take to get familiar with use the linux console to record measurement however the suppose monochromatic source show beating which suggests a second less intense wavelength be also present in the source this can be compare to the interferogram show in fig 3 which be for two distinct frequency be present a this be not the desire result a new green laser be use which be monochromatic the number of sample take lead to an interferogram which be difficult to analyse there be an increase in amplitude the far to the right the stage move this suggests that the null point be present at a distance that be far to the right the null point of a monochromatic source would be when the interferogram be at a maximum however the entire gaussian distribution for the interferogram be much wider on the order of several millimetre there be a payoff between the time it take to record the data and the resolution if the resolution be high which corresponds with the stage move at a slow rate it take longer to record since there be limited lab time quick calculation be make to reach a compromise between the two factor a white lead source be now use to try and find the null point the pattern show in fig 5 be the one which corresponds to the null point for a white light source first a rough and low resolution interferogram be take around where the null point be estimate to be locate the range of the measurement would be a few millimetre and the null point would be show a a vertical line in the data then a second high resolution interferogram be take around this point to obtain one that be similar to the simulation show in fig 5. the record interferogram for the white lead be asymmetric while the simulation displayed an interferogram that be symmetrical about the null point this may be due to imperfection of the mirror or the beam splitter this asymmetry be also found when the interferogram be record again which suggests an error within the setup be the cause with the null point have be found we can use the interferometer a a spectroscope for other light source the light source which be be investigate be a white lead blue lead and a white light tungsten source with a green and yellow filter the interferogram for the white light tungsten source with the green filter be not include a the result obtain be dominate by noise the green filter lead to the light reach the detector to be too dim even with the gain of the detector turn up to the maximum the background light and electrical fluctuation of the source cause the data to be inadequate the coherence length obtain from the interferograms can then be use in equation 1 to find the spectral width of the different source the coherence length be give below white lead − 5.6 × 10 −6 m white tungsten − 9.8 × 10 −6 m blue lead − 1.5 × 10 −5 m white tungsten with yellow filter − 3.4 × 10 −5 m. after use these coherence length in equation 1 the spectral width be calculate a such white lead − 8.5 × 10 12 hz white tungsten − 4.9 × 10 12 hz blue lead − 3.2 × 10 12 m white tungsten with yellow filter − 1.4 × 10 12 m. the white light source have a great spectral width than the single colour this be expect since white light be compose of several different frequency within the visible spectrum look up literature value for blue and yellow light show that the spectral width that have be calculate be not great than the range for those colour blue light have a frequency interval of approximately 610 -670 thz and yellow light have a frequency interval of approximately 510 -540 thz 5 the value for the spectral width of both colour that have be experimentally obtain be small than the frequency interval there be a lack of error analysis due to a lack of time the error and uncertainty will arise from several factor the precision of the measurement of the stage movement by the computer the noise present in the interferogram particularly for dimmer light source and the measurement of the coherence length will be source for error,extended,the

32,2ndINT_TFY667_Redacted,the aim of the experiment be to investigate the property of different light source and filter use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer the null point be found to be -0.86 ± 0.01 mm the mean wavelength of white light from an lead be measure to be 580 ± 5 nm compare to 814 ± 158 nm from a tungsten white light lamp illustrate tungsten a a black body place a green filter on the tungsten source widen the coherence length from 0.818 ± 0.318 µm to 1.80 ± 0.11 µm fourier transforms of interferograms be take and the spectral width explore with systematic error discuss to highlight the accuracy of the experiment the michelson interferometer be an extremely precise instrument which have application in physic such a detect gravitational wave and fourier-transform spectroscopy of which the latter be the core of this experiment 1 interferograms can be generate where the light intensity at each wavelength can be analyse the main aim of this experiment be to construct and use a michelson interferometer a a spectrometer this be then use to investigate the spectrum of light source with different spectral composition through the interferograms that be create light source analyse include a green laser white lead blue lead and a tungsten white light with and without a green filter property explore include the null point mean wavelength coherence length spectral width and temperature in this instrument light travel from the source to the beamsplitter where it be split into two beam due to the beamsplitter have a partially silver mirror on it face the two beam of light be then reflect off separate mirror and then merge to create an interference pattern at the detector which can be record a an interferogram and analyse a diagram illustrate the schematic of the michelson interferometer and how it work can be show in fig 1. the interference pattern be determine by the path difference of the two beam if the distance from both mirror to the beamsplitter be the same the two beam undergo constructive interference if the path difference differs by half a wavelength the two beam interfere destructively create a dark fringe move one mirror fractionally make the pattern on the detector move between light and dark fringe when the mirror be completely parallel to each other haidinger fringe be form which appear to be circular however if one mirror be tilt slightly fizeau fringe be form which be straight line 2 the layout and mechanism of the michelson interferometer this show the path that the two beam take orange and green before recombine at the beamsplitter again mirror m2 be able to move a distance which be inputted electronically and m1 be fix the dielectric plate creates a phase change for one beam which lead to destructive interference at zero path difference between the two beam by slowly move one mirror about a null point where there be zero path difference between the two beam the output appear a a series of light and dark fringe on an electronic interferogram for a single monochromatic wave fourier transform this into frequency space which display amplitude against wavelength creates a delta function to display the single wavelength if there be only two wavelength present the output on the detector a the mirror be move away from the null point be the result sum of the two sinusoidal intensity distribution with a path difference when these wave be in phase again the overall fringe pattern form be the same a it be at the null point however this only occurs when there be two wavelength if there be more wavelength present the fringe pattern will not be in phase at any other point other than the null point the wavelength spectrum can only be deduce from conduct a fourier transform on the interferogram 2 3 a source have a spectral width ∆ν which be the range of frequency emit by the source or the width of a single spectral line for that case the coherence length be the distance which the move mirror can move before the interferogram contrast becomes poor the wider the spectral line the narrower the interferogram ∆ν can be found from where l be the coherence length m ∆ ν be the spectral width hz this can be change into wavelength use where λ be the mean wavelength 2 4 when a gaussian be fit to the fourier transform interferogram the fwhm of the gaussian be equal to ∆λ where wein 's displacement law can be use to deduce the temperature of a blackbody where t be the temperature k and λ peak be the mean wavelength m 5 after building the interferometer it be then necessary to align it use a green laser a the source we make sure that the laser spot be initially align at the move mirror m2 by block out the stationary mirror m1 this be repeat the other way round it be ensure that the laser beam be parallel to the table surface by make sure that the mirror and beam splitter be at the same height and perpendicular to the table surface two laser spot be form at the detector so we then tilt mirror m1 slightly until they overlap directly at the detector a lense with a focal length of 25mm be place in front of the laser to enlarge the beam and then a lense with a focal length of 100mm be place after the beamsplitter so the fringe could be see the mirror be tilt such that either a light or dark fringe sat in the middle of the detector if this be not the case when the other mirror move it would have take an average of fringe and the interferogram would have be constant the photodetector connect at the output of the interferometer be connect to the pc and the usb port set to low latency a it be attach to an amplifier the gain of the amplifier have to be adjust so that there be no clip on the interferogram when take data we be require to input the position we want the mirror to move to in mm the rate at which we want the stage to move in mm/s and the number of sample that we want to take we trialled the rate at 0.025 mm/s which be estimate use sample size the 50hz sample rate and the distance move after far experimentation we discover that the mirror might have be move too fast a we do n't achieve a sinusoidal form of fringe if the rate be too high the mirror create it 's own vibration which destroyed fringe therefore we calculate the maximum rate that the stage could move use the wavelength of a green laser the detector sample at 50hz and the fact that we want to collect data at least every quarter wavelength this come to a maximum rate of 0.005 mm/s we then lower the rate to 0.002 mm/s to ensure that the stage be move slow enough and saw that the interferograms be much well we try to find the null point within 1-2mm use the green laser this be locate at the peak of the wavepacket on the interferogram where there be complete constructive interference start from one end of the stage and move the mirror a small amount we discover a peak and thought it be the null point however after take a large range we discover that there be a beating effect so this may not have be the null point therefore we use a different method with a slow rate of 0.001 mm/s and realign the interferometer we start from one end of the stage and scan a small distance look at the interference pattern when move towards the null point the circular fringe go in towards the centre but when move away from the null point the circular fringe move away from the centre we scan small range and then deduce a small range in which the fringe change direction with the null point range found we replace the source with a white lead source we scan through a small range that contain the null point and observe the interference pattern this be do at a rate of 0.001mm/s with 10 000 sample we repeat this with a blue lead and a white light tungsten source with and without a green filter these interferograms be analyse to find the mean wavelength of the source the coherence length spectral width and temperature for the tungsten source fourier transforms of the interferograms be also take in order to display the wavelength spectrum in frequency space mean wavelength be obtain by measure the length between several wavelength on the interferogram and then divide by the number of wavelength coherence length be measure use the interferogram to deduce the distance between the point where there be poor contrast and the fringe be no longer sinusoidal however result from this method be in the wrong order of magnitude therefore we decide to plot gaussian fit use python onto the fourier transform graph to determine the fwhm from σ in order to obtain the spectral width ∆λ equation 1 and 2 be then use to deduce coherence length the null point be found between -0.9mm and -0.7mm but more precisely at about -0.86 ± 0.01 mm this be found by move the stage extremely slowly between small range within -0.9mm and -0.7mm the result for the characteristic of the different light source be displayed in table 1. it be discover that the stage do not move linearly between sample and that this would lead to systematic error in result the interferogram of white light around the null point be show in fig 2. this agrees with the theory such that there be only constructive interference between all wavelength at the null point so this be the only point where white light fringe be found at all other point all the wavelength be never completely in phase after fourier transform the interferogram the result wavelength spectrum can be show in fig 3 it be important to remove the offset which be create by the background noise before conduct the fourier transform this offset level be see from the value that the stable line of the interferogram be at instead of zero which for white light be 88 000 arbitrary unit compare the mean wavelength obtain in table 1 to the theoretical value of 575 nm which lie within the uncertainty this value only have a 0.87 error 6 the spectral width value be slightly small than it should be when look at the fwhm of the graph in fig 3 where it can be estimate to be about 200nm therefore the main error in our result be due to the fact that the spectrum do n't actually display a gaussian shape and the gaussian fit could be big and wider the interferogram obtain for the blue lead be displayed in fig 4. the fourier transform interferogram can be show in fig 5 where an offset of 15 000 arbitrary unit have be remove compare the mean wavelength obtain in table 1 to the theoretical value of 475 nm which lie within the uncertainty this value only have a 0.42 error the spectral width value we obtain be fairly accurate since look at fig 5 it can be estimate to be about 35nm from the fwhm of the original curve without the gaussian fit this be because the blue lead display a more gaussian-like curve this spectral width be also small than that of white light a expect due to it have a wider interferogram the interferogram obtain for the tungsten white light source be displayed in fig 6 with it 's

the visible region 7 compare the mean wavelength obtain in table 1 to the theoretical value of about 840nm which lie within the uncertainty there be only a 3 error the change in the mean wavelength from the white lead to the tungsten lamp fig 5. the fourier transform to frequency space of the blue lead interferogram with the gaussian fit this spectrum be a lot narrower than the white lead spectrum due to the interferogram be wider demonstrates the shift from visible light to infrared thus display tungsten 's black body property the spectral width value be small than it should be when look at fig 7 where it can be estimate to be about 300nm this could be due to the spectrum not actually display a gaussian shape but a black body shape tungsten light source exhibit black body emission profile and the temperature of the source at the emission of the peak wavelength can be found use equation 4. this give a value of 3560 k. theoretically this should be around 3200k so this value only have a 11 error 7 the interferogram obtain from the white light tungsten source with a green filter be displayed in fig 8. the narrow bandwidth of the green filter widens the coherence length of the interfere light which the result in table 1 agree with a the coherence length obtain for the tungsten with the green filter be great than without the filter there be also some beating in the interferogram perhaps due to there be two frequency very close together after passing through the filter the fourier transform of the interferogram be show in fig 9 with a offset of 20 000 arbitrary unit have be remove from this the spectral width can be estimate to be 70nm therefore the result we obtain in table 1 be much small however it can clearly be see that the fourier transform spectrum do not have a gaussian shape at all especially since it be part of a white spectrum slope therefore plot a gaussian be inaccurate and maybe two or three gaussians on each spike would have be well the spike be due to the green filter reduce intensity by reduce the number of frequency that can pas through however this gaussian may be useful if one desire to manufacture a product that rely on a coherence length derive from the σ value the mean wavelength in table 1 compare to a theoretical value of about 544nm which lie within the uncertainty in our value other error in the result could be due to the uncertainty in the green filter specification a it claimed to have a central wavelength at 543.5 ± 2 nm and a fwhm at 10 ± 2nm 8 however these be very small uncertainty so can be consider negligible v. conclusion ultimately the michelson interferometer be successfully use a a spectrometer to perform fourier spectroscopy in order to characterise different light source and filter although the result be consistent with the theory they be n't completely accurate systematic error in result obtain be either due to the non linear movement of the stage or the interferometer not be perfectly align error in the spectral width additionally would have be cause by the error in use a gaussian fit to a non-gaussian plot this could have result in the spectral width obtain all be small than they should have be to improve we could try to quantify the variation in the stage 's movement to reduce systematic error and improve result we also could plot gaussian fit to the interferograms rather than the fourier transforms a these displayed more of a gaussian fit,superficial,the

be apply on the interferograms to yield the spectral characteristic of each source and these be compare and explain with the physic of each source t he goal of this experiment be to observe the spectral characteristic of various source and compare them use the physic involve in each source fourier transform spectroscopy be a less direct method of spectroscopy than for example use a monochromator or grate however can have a high signal to noise ratio than these simpler technique provide the main source of noise be not shot-noise this be know a felgett 's advantage 2 the first component of our fourier transform spectroscopy be the michelson interferometer be first use in 1887 for the famous michelson-morley experiment 1 which fail to detect luminiferous aether wind the second component be the fourier transform which be use to transition from path length space into wavelength space t he michelson inferometer consists of a ray from a light source travel to a beam splitter where it be sent to two different mirror at distance d 1 and d 2 from the beam splitter respectively the light reflect of each mirror and recombines before be receive by the photodetector a diagram be show in figure 1. crucially we can vary d 1 use a stepper motor by take the difference in length t |d 1 − d 2 we can determine the path difference between the two beam of light when they recombine a p t 2 this path difference cause the light to be at a different phase at the photodetector and so an interference pattern be generate different wavelength of light will interfere differently until the null point be reach where p t 0 and there be maximum constructive interference by vary p and take the output from the photodiode at each point we be able to produce an interferogram s ince a path difference be create between the two beam in an interferometer and light have a finite speed the path difference will translate into an effective temporal difference between the two beam this allows u to use a fourier transform to move between the time domain and the frequency domain for a specific wavenumber k 0 the intensity at the photodetector be give by where i k be the intensity of the source at the wavenumber k. apply the superposition principle the intensity detetected at the photodiode for all wavelength be give by where i k be the intensity distribution for the light source this be simply a cosine fourier transform therefore to retreive the intensity distribution we simply need to compute the inverse cosine fourier transform in practice we can take the real part of an inverse fourier transform a the signal be real t here be many different mechanism for light emission for a normal lead i.e the blue lead in our experiment electron travel over a band gap in a pn junction the potential difference on each side of the junction be different and this cause them to emit a photon of a specific wavelength to conserve energy in the white `` lead '' an lead be incident upon a fluorescent material this cause the photon emit by the lead to be absorbed by the material and re-emitted a a wide spectrum of different wavelength cause the light to appear white this be possible a the absorbed energy be first transfer away by vibration in the material before later be radiate away a a photon in a white tungsten lamp a filament be heat up and begin to emit many diffrent wavelength of light a a black body this mechanism consists of electron in the tungsten become excite to many different energy level and then transition down to many other level cause a wide array of different wavelength to be emit this spectrum of emission be give by planck 's law 6 where h be planck 's constant c be the speed of light k b be boltzmann 's constant and t be the temperature of the body the emission from a mercury gas discharge lamp be again cause by electron fall down energy level in a mercury atom a the mercury be a gas the atom be in thermal motion and so have momentum when a photon be release it energy may vary depend on the momentum of the atom this be know a doppler broadening and the derivation yield a gaussian emission profile 7 a. alignment f irst the component of the interferometer be attach to the optical table a show in figure 1. the next step be to align each component start at the beam splitter the light from the beam splitter be first make to be incident to the motorise mirror m2 centrally and perpendicularly to the surface of the mirror next the current distace between the beam splitter and m2 be measure when the motor be set to it middle location this distance be use to place m1 a very similar distance away in order to minimise time spent search for the null point and maximise the potential range the interferogram may be take over this mirror be also make to have light incident to it centrally and perpendicularly it be useful to check the beam splitter for the reflection to confirm this finally the photodetector be align such that the recombine beam be incident to it 's detector alignment be checked by make sure that the reflection from both mirror overlap each other completely the null point be the point at p 0 and may be found through a variety of different method the first be to simply move m2 through it 's full range and take a interferogram of white light to see when the intensity peak the second be to use a green laser and count the number of fringe observe at the photodetector this can be do by place a white surface in front of the photodetector the third method be to slowly move the mirror m2 at roughly 1µms −1 and observe whether the fringe appear to move `` out '' or `` in '' the fringe will start move in the other direction once the null point have be pass method 2 and 3 with a green laser be combine to perform a binary search until the region contain the null point be small enough to switch to white light and scan over the region the null point be found from the point on the interferogram with maximum interference after the null point be found collect data be quite trivial the source and filter may be varied and different interferograms take about the null point the mirror be make to start and finish at approximately the same distance to the null point it be important to note that the distance range of the interferogram be proportional to the resolution of the fourier transform and the resolution of the interferogram be proportional to the range of the fourier transform therefore in order to get good resolution large range be take and we also make sure to move the mirror slow enough to detect sufficiently small wavelength t he interferograms of the various source be show in the follow figure the position variable be position of the mirror and not from the null point although the null point be extremely close to the mirror 's 0 position these graph be sometimes hard to read a they contain many data point which blur together it can be see from these that the wider source of light have narrower coherence length the spectrum found by take the fourier transform of the interferograms be show in the follow figure the error on the fit be generate use an estimate covariance matrix not all spectrum have theoretical background for use a gaussian fit however it be convenient since it be simple and quantifies an approximation for the full-width-half-maximum the amplitude value on the graph be simply a 24 bit number output from the photodetector and have no unit the gaussian for the blue lead give a mean of 484.84 ± and standard deviation 13 ± 1 nm the white spectrum appear to contain two gaussians however we be unable to fit a second the mean wavelength here be 560 ± 1 nm and the standard deviation 76 ± 13 nm the standard deviation for this spectrum be much high than for the blue lead a expect the tungsten spectrum should theoretically be a black body spectrum and so fit use planck 's law however potentially due to the sensitivity of the photodiode to different wavelength the output appear very similar to a gaussian and so a gaussian be use this give a mean wavelength of 805.9±0.2 nm and standard deviation 119±7 nm notably the mean wavelength lie outside the visible range however the standard deviation be so great that the lamp appear white the fit for the green filter tungsten spectrum theoretically would be a convolution of the sensitivity of the photodiode with planck 's law however a gaussian again seem to be a good enough approximation the mean wavelength be 531.09±0.04 nm and the standard deviation 18±4 nm the green filter be able to filter all other wavelength exceptionally well and it be no surprise that this mean wavelength lie in the green part of the spectrum fig 12. a spectrum of a tungsten lamp with a yellow filter the spectrum be again narrower but can be see to be shift to the right slightly again use a gaussian for the yellow filter tungsten spectrum we find a mean of 569.8 ± 0.4 nm lie in the yellow part of visible light the standard deviation be found to be 24 ± 4 nm this mercury spectrum show the two region we be interested in the green peak and the yellow doublet we use filter to focus on the two area separately a gaussian fit to the green filter mercury show a mean wavelength of 547.4 ± 0.2 nm and a standard deviation of 30±4 nm this agrees quite close with the accepted value of the emission at 546.1nm 8 the 0.24 discrepancy between our value and the accepted value be potentially due to the variable sensitivity of the photodiode and with far analysis this could be account for we be unable to fit to the doublet spectrum however just reading from the graph it be possible to see that the mean wavelength be about 573nm and 620nm this difficulty in fitting may have be cause by take an interferogram over too long a range and so increase the number of noise data point we be able to use a hilbert transform to plot and fit to the envelope of the blue lead and mercury lamp interferograms the standard deviation of these gaussians agree with the spectrum assume that they be the fourier transforms of the spectrum gaussians a expect v. conclusion t he goal of this experiment be to record interferograms characterise spectrum from various source this be do quite effectively with the measure value for the mercury green line found to be 546.4 ± 0.2 nm which agrees with the nist accepted value well than 0.24 to improve this experiment interferograms could be take to reduce the amount of data in some of the fourier

62,2ndINT_BOD369_Redacted,a michelson interferometer be use to perform fourier-transform spectroscopy ft on three separate light source -a white lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapour lamp -in order to analyse their spectrum and therefore discern the manner in which they emit the source be expect to emit light via different physical process and be purposefully chosen a such to demonstrate both the versatility of ft and different spectrum form via different form of luminescence t he michelson interferometer fig 1 have provide success in help to discern the nature of electromagnetic wave most famously by the negative result of the michelson-morley experiment 1887 to suggest the non-existence of the luminiferous ether in this series of experiment we use a michelson interferometer a a fourier transform spectrometer in order to analyse the property of three light source a white lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapour lamp this technique involves measure the total intensity i λ of the interference pattern produce by a light source at a single point a a function of the path difference λ between it can be show that the transform pair of i λ be i k where k 1 λ be the wave number and λ be the wavelength of light be detect 1 the exact form of i λ be likely to be too complex to be transform by hand therefore this must generally be do computationally an interferometer induces an interference pattern so that the characteristic of source emission may be analyse however this pattern be effect by both path difference a well a the coherence of the interfere light path difference effect how the split wave will superpose when recombine this be most straight forward for monochromatic light where the amplitude detect a λ be related to the path difference λ between the split beam by where a be half the amplitude of the source beam in this case 1 spatial and temporal coherence of a source will effect how emission interfere temporal coherence be a measure of the correlation of a wave 's phase at different point along the direction of propagation that be how the emission from the source varies in time fig 2a a temporally incoherent source will never cause an interference pattern a the phase shift a function of time of the split wave will differ and the pattern will alter too quickly to be detectable 1 note however that a partially temporally coherent source will still produce discernible fringe when the path difference of the split beam be small spatial coherence be a measure of the correlation of a wave 's phase at different point perpendicular to the direction of propagation that be how the source emission varies across a wave-front fig 2b 2 a all the source use be extend they be all therefore spatially incoherent in this paper the coherence length shall be define a for approximately gaussian distribution where ∆λ be the twice the standard deviation of the gaussian and λ be it peak wavelength 3 this represent the range centre on the point of zero path difference which shall be refer to a the null point within which fringe will be easily detectable for example a broad spectrum with large ∆λ will produce a very narrow region within which fringe exist the interferometer be set up a in fig 1 where the mirror be position to be approximately the same distance 15cm from the beam splitter accuracy in position be not necessary a all path difference be to be control by the movable mirror therefore so long a a large enough range centre on the midpoint exist data could be take effectively a 100mm focal length lens be fix to the beam splitter entrance to focus the beam during splitting and reflection this be do so a to reduce the loss in luminosity of the beam due to dispersion before recombination a 25.4mm focal length lens be attach to the splitter exit to spread out the fringe so they could be more easily distinguish by the detector within the housing of the interferometer the photodetector use be an osram sfh 2200 photodiode set to have a sample rate of 50hz 4 the effective range of detection can be see in fig 3. a 532nm laser be use to calibrate the mirror a any interference pattern would be easily see and should exist for a large range of path difference due to the laser 's large coherence length it can be show that fringe separation increase a the interfere beam become more parallel a such the mirror fig 3. effectiveness of detector across a range of wavelength 4 be adjust until a set of haidinger fringe be see to be centre on the detector a this would maximise contrast between fringe 9 10 a region contain the null point be found by observe the region within which the central fringe be the only one visible a the interfere beam simply superpose to form the source beam and thus produce no interference pattern once a sufficiently small range be found the laser be replace by a blue lead and a measurement take across that range to find the null point more easily this be do a ∆λ for the lead be much small than that of the laser and a such the region in which fringe could be detect would be localise to a small region surround the null point it be found to be 7.24 ± 0.001mm from the zero point on the move mirror a far measurement be take with no light source active in order to establish the level of background noise with reading found to be ∼ 100 time dimmer than the mercury lamp and ∼ 10000 time dimmer than the lead and tungsten lamp the first source under consideration be a white lead in order to achieve a broad spectrum in the visible a violet lead be commonly use to stimulate a phosphor layer to produce a spectrum similar to that in fig 4a white light can also be produce through the combination of red green and blue light from three separate led produce a spectrum similar to that of fig 4b fringe produce by the rgb lead should noticeably beat due to the superposition of three distinct wavelength of similar amplitude where a the `` warm '' lead would likely lack this quality the second source be that of an incandescent tungsten lamp heat to around 2800k under these condition tungsten should act a a black body radiator produce a spectrum like that in fig 5. when the effective detector range be take into account the spectrum should drop off very rapidly beyond 950nm produce a spectrum of coherence length very similar to that of the detector sensitivity ∼ 1µm the third source be a mercury vapour lamp this work by excite the electron in mercury vapour to emit light upon move to a low energy from this excite state heisenberg 's uncertainty principle can be use to relate the lifetime of an excite state with the uncertainty of it energy a short lifetime will have a large energy uncertainty and thus a large ∆λ 8 in this way the coherence length of an emission will be determine by the stability of the excite state of interest line of note within the effective range of the detector should be those of 403 435 546 578 and 1012. v. data analysis the white lead be fit and measurement take across a 0.35mm interval centre on the position of the null point see fig 7 and the spectrum compute with fit gaussian distribution overlaid onto the peak see fig 8. the fringe appear to display no beating far the spectrum show a broad peak in the visible with a small peak in the violet imply that the source be more similar to the `` warm '' lead however a certain level of asymmetry about the maximum be present which remains unexplained the total coherence length be calculate to be 6.07µm to 3 significant figure the tungsten filament lamp be then use a a light source this produce light via incandescence and a such the emission spectrum should have a similar form to that of a black body spectrum fig 5. however likely due to the detector 's effective range the spectrum peak at 806 nm and then rapidly decline to zero after around 900nm the fringe themselves can be see in fig 9 and exist over a very small interval ∼ 10 −6 metre which be to be expect for a source of coherence length calculate to be 1.68µm to 3 significant figure this be on the same order a our estimate base off of the detector range far support that this be the limit factor fig 8. spectrum derive from take fourier transform of data in fig 7. this spectrum be extremely similar in form to that of the `` warm '' lead in fig 3a imply that the lead be of similar construction the mercury source be far dimmer than any other source use and a warm up period be require to allow all the mercury to vaporise the spectrum fig 12 display a number of distinct peak however too much noise exists within the information in order to accurately fit a set of gaussian function mapping to the position of the peak a such the coherence length of the source can not be effectively calculate use this data however the nature of the fringe measure in fig 11 would imply that the total distance across which the fringe be visible be great than the 2mm range which be measure thus the coherence length be likely great than 2mm furthermore the narrowness of peak see in fig 12 would imply that the excite state of interest have a relatively long lifetime and so the state of interest be quite stable however in order to produce an accurate estimate measurement would be need across the whole of the interference pattern the two high peak occur around those predict in fig 5 however a third primary peak occurs at an unpredicted wavelength of approximately 510nm possibly imply that there be some contaminant element in the lamp a small amount of argon be commonly use a a medium in lamp of this kind however this emission line be not typical of argon or mercury imply that some other element be likely present 11 moreover there be an unexpected peak at 1072nm however in fig 6 a broader peak can be see this be more similar to that of a black body spectrum likely cause by the internal heating within the lamp which may serve a an explanation it can be see in fig 11 that the maximum be not centre on the expect location of the null point 7.24 ± 0.001mm this be likely a for small wavelength error in set up become more prominent a the resultant path difference correspond to large phase difference eq 1. vi conclusion three different type of light source be analyse use ft a white lead a tungsten filament lamp and a mercury vapour lamp all of which be partially temporally incoherent a well a be spatially incoherent it be found that the white lead produce a spectrum fig 8 more similar to that of a phosphor base `` warm '' white lead fig 4a than that of a lead make up of separate red green and blue led fig 4b produce the spectrum in fig 8 with a coherence length of 6.07µm to 3 significant figure the tungsten filament lamp be expect to have a the spectrum of a black body at 2800k fig 5 however likely due to the effective range of the detector fig 3 this spectrum rapidly decline shortly after 900nm peak at 806nm with a coherence length calculate to be 1.68µm to 3 significant figure by comparison we can then say that the lead be a more coherent source than then tungsten lamp the mercury source produce a spectrum fig 12 with a distinct set of peak although the data be not stable enough to effectively produce a gaussian describe the nature of the emission line a a result a coherence length could not be calculate however it magnitude could be expect to be great than 2mm a the full set of fringe do not appear to be present in fig 11. a notable peak be situate at 511nm which do not exist in the expect mercury emission spectrum nor in the spectrum of argon a common medium in lamp of this kind this implies that there be likely some other contaminant present in the lamp emit there be also another unexpected peak at 1072nm which may be cause by black body radiation from heating in the lamp in order to verify any of these hypothesis however measurement must be take across the entirety of the mercury lamp

67,2ndINT_LEH982_Redacted,one of the aim of this set-up be to estimate the spectrum of light emit by various source an easy way to estimate the mean wavelength of a signal be to manually measure the distance between the node in the interferogram the mean distance between the node be equal to half of the mean wavelength 11 this experiment be affected by many source of error we have already mention the fault in the stage 's position record which be the big source of systematic error however this experiment be also affected by random error and other systematical error table i summarises the different source of error their magnitude and the mean by which the latter can be reduce unless state otherwise the magnitude of the error be give a their contribution to the wavelength 's standard deviation for the green laser this paper prof the presence of a systematical error due to an inaccurate record of the move stage position in an interferometry experiment it present a method to correct for this error by compute a periodic scale of the position for a set of data take over a long range with a laser of know wavelength the validity of this approach be then investigate by correct various set of data with different test run this correction be very efficient a it reduces the broadening of the spectral line from ten of nanometre to a few namometres whilst keep the accuracy of the initial set of data more precisely in the case of the mercury lamp the correction make it possible to distinguish two separate peak at 530.91 ± 0.21nm and 577.51 ± 0.34nm when the non-corrected data present a band of wavelength between 630nm and 544nm approximately if this first correct wavelength be shift significantly from the accepted value of 546.07nm 1 the second ray be close to the middle of the two wavelength that compose the expect doublet at 576.959 nm and 579.065 nm 1,expert,exp
68,2ndINT_TGO908_Redacted,we use a michelson-interferometer to measure the spectral width in the frequency and wavelength domain along with wavelength of white lead blue lead a tungsten lamp and a tungsten lamp with a green filter fourier transform allows u to find the wavelength 429.5 ± 100nm 331.5 ± 30nm 574.9 ± 200nm and 513.1 ± 40nm respectively additionally the spectral width be 27.6 ± 13.1nm 4.7 ± 1.3nm 45.1 ± 3.9nm and 2.3 ± 0.8nm respectively t his experiment us the michelson-interferometer to obtain interferograms of various light source we carry out far computational analysis to get their coherence length and spectral width in 1881 albert a. michelson design the basis of a spectral interferometer in order to test for an 'aether alongside edward w. morely since the existence of this be disprove this instrument have be modify and use in relativity spectroscopy and interferometry the interferogram be a fourier transform of the light source so spectrum in different domain can be deconstruct then construct so we can obtain far information about light source this interferometer employ division of amplitude 1 a oppose to division of wavefront precise measurement of length be record use the aparatus show in the schematic in fig 1. the monochromatic plane wave from source be incident on the partially silver surface of the beam-splitter send beam to the two mirror m 1 and m 2. m 1 have an adjustable tilt whereas m 2 have an adjustable position an interference pattern form when the two beam be reflect back record by the photodiode detector.the path difference of the two beam be 2t however for an observer look from an angle θ to the normal of the mirror the path difference be actually 2dcosθ if the distance traverse by the two beam differs by an integer number of wavelength λ we expect constructive interference hence a bright fringe whereas if the distance differs by an integer multiple of λ/2 we expect destructive interference however the dielectric plate on one side of the beam-splitter cause a phase change therefore produce a dark fringe at zero path difference instead the adjustable tilt of m 1 determines the type of fringe produce when interference occurs if m 1 and m 2 be parallel it be equivalent to the source be in line with each other this cylindrical symmetry cause the characteristic circular haidinger fringe to form a show in the right diagram of fig 2. if m 1 be inclined and intersects with m 2 the straight line fringe also call fizeau fringe be distinguishable at the detector these be contour of the wedge between the first mirror and the image of the second mirror reflect in the beam-splitter however if mirror be inclined and do not intersect the resultant fringe be curve section of hyperbola 2 a show in the middle diagram of fig 2. the interferogram record a fourier transform of the spectral line shape from a frequency domain to a spatial domain in frequency space the monochromatic wave be a delta function if the source emits light with two frequency the separation of these frequency relates to the spread of the null in the sequence of bright and dark fringe on the interferogram this spread be inversely proportional to the separation of the frequency hence a wide spectral width in the spatial domain form due to a narrow spectral width in the frequency domain 3 the spectral line be a fingerprint that can be use to identify atom a it presence indicates the idea of discrete energy level the spectral line shape of a lamp be approximately gaussian where it should ideally be a dirac delta function however spectral line broadening occurs this be due to heisenberg 's uncertainty principle which state there will be an intrinsic uncertainty in the energy of photon release by an atom -a natural spread of photon energy around the spectral line that form the gaussian shape another reason for the gaussian shape can be thermal doppler broadening cause by thermal vibration of the electron which change the observe frequency a more appropriate model for spectral line be the voigtian function 3 which be define by the convolution of a gaussian and lorentzian function we use the linux operating system to simulate the output expect from a light source with a specify width of the gaussian profile and an arbitrary intensity this simulation corroborate the theory that broadening the spectral line width in frequency domain narrow the separation of the null point in the interferogram and this be depict in fig 3. furthermore we use the the program to simulate interferograms with white blue and green light source a portrayed in fig 4. the spatial width of the white light simulation be much narrower than both blue and green light this occurs a there be a large range of frequency present in the white light spectrum whereas the range of wavelength for blue and green light be small fast fourier transforms ffts be perform on these interferograms obtain from the simulation give the spectrum in wavelength domain and validate the expect wavelength for the respective light source when construct the interferometer we use a lens of focal length 24.5mm before the beam-splitter so light from the green laser focus on the it after the beam split and recombine we place a lens of focal length 100mm before the detector to diverge the laser light if multiple fringe be incident on the aperture of the detector the signal of the peak would cancel the signal of the trough make it necessary to diverge the beam the mirror m 2 be on a stage it position be control by a motor connect to the computer along with the photodiode detector the detector sample at a rate of 50hz a a default align the interferometer be one of the most important procedure a the quality of data depends on it to ensure the interferometer align well we checked for constructive interference a large distance from the detector if circular haidinger fringe be produce here then it would definitely be well-aligned at the detector we use the green laser a a tool to find the null point the position of m 2 where t 0. when the stage be move slowly the fringe appear or disappear from the centre depend on whether we scan away or towards the null point meaning the null point be situate where the fringe change direction then scan through with a white lead confirm this range to be 8.073 − 8.085 ± 0.0005mm we select the range of position to scan through the speed and the number of sample take depend on the expect interferogram width of the respective light source there be four light source that we characterise in this experiment white lead blue lead white tungsten light and white tungsten light with a green filter another point to note about the tungsten lamp when the fit function be apply the fit wavelength belong in the infrared region hence it can be model a a black body emitter use wein 's displacement law the temperature t have a value of 5040 ± 1000k this be the correct order of magnitude for a tungsten lamp we apply ffts to the interferograms to transform them from a spatial domain to a wavelength domain this give gaussian-like shape for the distribution of the wavelength from which the average wavelength be calculate the spread of wavelength for white lead be show in fig 7. this be expect because white lead comprises blue/uv light along with yellow light from fluorescence 4 the small peak corresponds to approximately 360nm which lie in the uv range and the large peak corresponds to 500nm which be closer to the yellow range wavelength to work out the coherence length l we fit a gaussian over the interferogram and use the relationship to find the full-width half maximum fwhm which be an approximation for the coherence length of the source in order to obtain the value present in table i and table ii we take five interferograms of each of the light source this reduces the chance of anomaly in the data when the average be take the value of the error be also low because the sample size be high the error in the average wavelength arise from the analysis of the fit function and spread of the fit wavelength to the interferogram the error in the coherence length can be determine by how appropriate the gaussian fit be for an interferogram and the error in the σ value for the fit the gaussian fit best on the tungsten lamp interferogram and it be the least appropriate for the tungsten lamp with a green filter this be because the green frequency emit be close in frequency space which cause beating form the shape outside the central envelope also because the gaussian be not a good fit for the spectral line this be illustrate in fig 8. the bandwidth theorem and the relationship between the frequency bandwidth and coherence time 5 rearranges to where ∆ν be the frequency bandwidth in unit of hz this can be rearrange to calculate the spectral width in the wavelength domain also the error in table ii be calculate use propagation of error formula from the l value the white lead and white tungsten lamp have a similar spectral width in the frequency space however it differs significantly in wavelength space -showing that the tungsten lamp be more of a continuous spectrum the blue and green filter tungsten lamp have narrower spectral width a they consist of more distinct frequency hence give them large coherence length v. conclusion this experiment give the spectral width of white lead and white tungsten lamp a 27.6 ± 13.1nm and 45.1 ± 3.9nm respectively whereas for blue lead and a tungsten lamp with green filter they be 4.7 ± 1.3nm and 2.3 ± 0.8nm respectively compare this to the interferograms the reciprocity between spatial domain and frequency wavelength domain be far solidify the main source of error be most likely the limitation of the light source and stray light create noise in interferograms,superficial,the
