the atomic number z be 1. therefore the rydberg constant be define a in this experiment we experimentally measure the rydberg constant if hydrogen gas be heat or electrically charge the electron in the atom be excite and the add energy push the electron to high energy orbitals when the electron fall back to their original position the add energy be re-emitted in the form of photon and the wavelength of the photon be determine by the differnece in energy between the orbitals a show in where m can be call the order number we set up the spectrometer a show in fig 3.1 use a collimator a grate and a camera with a crosshair and ensure that they be in parallel the beam of photon from the light source be diffract by the grate so we set the angular position of the camera when they be parallel a an origin and rotate it until a light fringe be observe then we measure the angle of diffraction by measure the change in angle from the origin use a vernier we repeat this with a many other fringe a possible and statisticised the result to find the rydberg constant although the rydberg constant obtain from the experiment be reasonably close to the theoretical value the uncertainty of the constant be unacceptably huge and we found that there be various reason that affected our value since the room be dark and it be hard to read the cramped number on the veriner the angle of diffraction could be measure imprecisely we conclude that this be the major factor that affected the inaccurate rydberg constant we found that the major uncertainty emerge in consequence of the wide slit size since this cause the thicker width of the light fringe this could be improve by use a narrow slit there could be various systematic error that affected the result we try to perfectly align the spectrometer but this could be unsuccessful also the position of the lamp should have be a close to the slit a possible since it be directly related to the intensity of the light this could make u see the cyan colour light the air pressure and humidity be also other source but we decide that they be negligible there be background light which be inevitably require to measure the angle of diffraction we thought this could be the reason why the cyan colour of light and the 3 rd order light fringe of red and violet light be not detect and test without any light but we still could not see
